1
00:00:12,853 --> 00:00:18,371
Right now, terrorists are plotting
to assassinate a presidential candidate.

2
00:00:18,453 --> 00:00:20,921
My wife and daughter are in danger.

3
00:00:21,013 --> 00:00:24,688
And people that I work with
may be involved in both.

4
00:00:25,453 --> 00:00:31,050
I'm Federal Agent Jack Bauer,
and this is the longest day of my life.

5
00:00:35,613 --> 00:00:37,604
Get back! Get back!

6
00:00:38,613 --> 00:00:40,683
I say we cut our losses and get outta here.

7
00:00:40,773 --> 00:00:45,130
Believe me, killing Bauer is
our only chance of staying alive.

8
00:00:49,053 --> 00:00:52,489
Put down the weapon, Mr. Gaines.
We can protect you.

9
00:00:53,813 --> 00:00:56,008
Put down the weapon!

10
00:00:57,613 --> 00:00:59,524
Good luck.

11
00:01:05,133 --> 00:01:06,566
Kim!

12
00:01:07,853 --> 00:01:11,402
- Dad said Rick would be here. Where is he?
- They'll find him.

13
00:01:11,933 --> 00:01:15,050
- Sweetheart.
- Jack! This nightmare's finally over, right?

14
00:01:15,133 --> 00:01:17,124
Yes. I promise.

15
00:01:21,613 --> 00:01:22,841
A year from now,

16
00:01:22,933 --> 00:01:27,848
you'll either be promoting your agenda for
the nation, or visiting your son in prison.

17
00:01:27,933 --> 00:01:31,243
- Keith had nothing to do with Ferragamo.
- Of course he didn't.

18
00:01:31,333 --> 00:01:35,087
But if somebody were to
mention the word "arson"...

19
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:38,731
You planted something?

20
00:01:38,813 --> 00:01:43,489
The people we both work for, David,
they know how to get what they want.

21
00:01:43,813 --> 00:01:45,769
Upgrade the threat assessment.

22
00:01:45,853 --> 00:01:49,892
Our contact over there says
this assassin left Yugoslavia this morning.

23
00:01:49,973 --> 00:01:53,522
- Which means he's probably already here.
- A second hitter.

24
00:02:17,533 --> 00:02:19,524
- You OK?
- Yeah.

25
00:02:21,293 --> 00:02:23,284
Are you all right?

26
00:02:38,733 --> 00:02:41,406
- Who's in this chopper?
- Just Jack and his family.

27
00:02:41,493 --> 00:02:43,961
The prisoners are in other transport.

28
00:03:04,013 --> 00:03:06,004
Sir, this way.

29
00:03:08,093 --> 00:03:09,845
All together.

30
00:03:10,933 --> 00:03:12,844
Are you hurt?

31
00:03:12,933 --> 00:03:16,209
No. My stomach's been
bothering me for a couple of hours.

32
00:03:16,293 --> 00:03:18,761
Sweetheart, did something happen there?

33
00:03:19,813 --> 00:03:22,566
No. It's probably just
from all the stress, honey.

34
00:03:22,653 --> 00:03:27,727
There's an ambulance waiting to take you
to a clinic where a doctor will examine you.

35
00:03:27,813 --> 00:03:31,362
- Can't we stay with you?
- No. I've gotta stay here at CTU.

36
00:03:32,293 --> 00:03:36,172
- Jack?
- Alberta. My wife Teri and my daughter Kim.

37
00:03:36,653 --> 00:03:38,689
- Hi.
- Thanks, Nina.

38
00:03:40,293 --> 00:03:43,285
- The ambulance will take them to the clinic.
- Good.

39
00:03:45,813 --> 00:03:48,771
You'll be going with Agent Scott.
He'll take care of you.

40
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:53,449
- Jack, what's gonna happen with you?
- It's all right, they just have to debrief me.

41
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:55,524
Hey, come here.

42
00:03:59,373 --> 00:04:02,365
Don't worry, OK? I'll call you as soon as I can.

43
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:09,332
We're doing more than debriefing you.
I have to place you under house arrest.

44
00:04:09,413 --> 00:04:13,884
You'll be held here and questioned
until we hand you over to the FBI.

45
00:04:41,493 --> 00:04:45,486
Nina, I want you to watch over
Teri and Kim. Make sure they're OK.

46
00:04:45,573 --> 00:04:49,851
- Green's got me doing mop-up.
- Get Tony to do it. Just get over to the clinic.

47
00:04:49,933 --> 00:04:52,925
- I'll have to get Green's approval.
- Nina, please!

48
00:05:07,693 --> 00:05:11,163
- Could you ask if I could have some water?
- Right away, sir.

49
00:05:31,933 --> 00:05:35,482
Alberta. Tony's finishing
the procedures on the mop-up.

50
00:05:35,573 --> 00:05:39,851
I've been here since before midnight.
I'd like an hour off to go home, clean up.

51
00:05:41,373 --> 00:05:43,603
Denied.

52
00:05:43,693 --> 00:05:45,843
Come on, Alberta. Please.

53
00:05:45,933 --> 00:05:48,083
I've been through hell today.

54
00:05:49,173 --> 00:05:53,530
I have a great eye for BS. If you want
an hour off, tell me where you're going.

55
00:05:57,493 --> 00:06:02,886
Jack asked me to look after Teri and Kim.
They feel isolated since he can't be there.

56
00:06:03,533 --> 00:06:07,446
Now, there's an irony for you:
You looking after Jack's wife.

57
00:06:11,453 --> 00:06:15,446
Make sure Tony's got everything
he needs before you leave.

58
00:06:21,293 --> 00:06:24,091
Elizabeth, have we heard
from Christopher yet?

59
00:06:24,173 --> 00:06:29,645
Yes. But he only had early projections. Those
were from New York and Massachusetts.

60
00:06:32,373 --> 00:06:34,523
Get with me when he has the other states.

61
00:06:34,613 --> 00:06:37,650
I wanna know if the incident
at the breakfast is hurting us.

62
00:06:37,733 --> 00:06:39,724
Of course.

63
00:06:50,093 --> 00:06:52,482
What's on your mind, Sherry?

64
00:07:05,613 --> 00:07:09,128
You've got to go out there today
with your best face on.

65
00:07:09,573 --> 00:07:13,122
There can be no talk about Keith
and no talk about Ferragamo.

66
00:07:13,213 --> 00:07:15,966
Ferragamo's death was an accident.

67
00:07:17,013 --> 00:07:19,288
I'm not gonna talk about Ferragamo.

68
00:07:20,413 --> 00:07:22,404
I'm dropping it.

69
00:07:23,533 --> 00:07:25,569
Really?

70
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:28,042
I'm being blackmailed.

71
00:07:29,653 --> 00:07:33,566
- By who?
- By some of the people who finance me.

72
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:37,089
- What do they want?
- They're determined I get to the White House.

73
00:07:37,173 --> 00:07:42,042
And if I don't do what they want, they say
they can build a murder case against Keith.

74
00:07:42,133 --> 00:07:43,771
For Lyle Gibson?

75
00:07:43,853 --> 00:07:46,526
No. For Dr Ferragamo.

76
00:07:47,053 --> 00:07:52,173
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no. Keith was
nowhere near Ferragamo's office today.

77
00:07:52,253 --> 00:07:56,041
According to Carl,
who's been doing all their dirty work,

78
00:07:57,293 --> 00:08:01,172
someone planted evidence that could
implicate Keith in Ferragamo's death.

79
00:08:01,253 --> 00:08:03,721
Oh, no, David. No.

80
00:08:03,813 --> 00:08:05,371
Oh, no.

81
00:08:05,453 --> 00:08:09,731
- This happens when you cover things up.
- Don't preach to me, David, OK?

82
00:08:20,373 --> 00:08:23,046
- What are we going to do?
- I don't know yet.

83
00:08:23,133 --> 00:08:25,806
- Does Keith know anything...?
- No.

84
00:08:26,293 --> 00:08:28,682
And he's not going to.

85
00:08:36,293 --> 00:08:41,162
You must be Teri. I'm Dr Kent. We're gonna
be taking very good care of you today.

86
00:08:41,253 --> 00:08:44,245
- This is your daughter Kim?
- Hi.

87
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:47,564
We know about your abdominal pain.
I'd like to get an ultrasound.

88
00:08:47,653 --> 00:08:50,486
No. It's actually not
as painful as it was before.

89
00:08:50,573 --> 00:08:54,361
That's good. But we wanna
make sure we know what it is.

90
00:08:56,093 --> 00:09:01,087
Is there any other discomfort? Anything
you wanna tell us before we examine you?

91
00:09:01,173 --> 00:09:02,572
No.

92
00:09:03,933 --> 00:09:05,730
Mom?

93
00:09:26,693 --> 00:09:28,490
Mrs. Bauer?

94
00:09:36,093 --> 00:09:38,084
I was raped.

95
00:09:40,293 --> 00:09:42,443
I see. OK.

96
00:09:43,933 --> 00:09:47,005
Then we're going to need to
draw blood and do some tests.

97
00:09:47,093 --> 00:09:49,891
And I would like to
recommend you to a psychiatrist.

98
00:09:49,973 --> 00:09:52,043
That's not necessary.

99
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:56,411
Mrs. Bauer, of course you can do what
you want, but under the circumstances,

100
00:09:56,493 --> 00:10:00,327
I think it's important for you to take
a few minutes and speak to someone.

101
00:10:00,413 --> 00:10:03,246
Well, I'd like to keep this confidential.

102
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:06,370
The records are private.
Only the doctors have access.

103
00:10:06,453 --> 00:10:09,445
No, I mean from my husband.

104
00:10:12,853 --> 00:10:15,321
All right, if that's what you wanna do.

105
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:36,166
The nurse'll be in shortly.

106
00:10:36,253 --> 00:10:42,044
I think we should spend some time with
Senators Blalock and Gleeson pretty soon.

107
00:10:42,133 --> 00:10:44,806
I don't feel comfortable
aligning myself with them.

108
00:10:44,893 --> 00:10:49,887
You're going to need their states.
Just being seen with them will go a long way.

109
00:10:52,373 --> 00:10:54,204
OK.

110
00:10:57,093 --> 00:10:59,288
Was there something else?

111
00:10:59,373 --> 00:11:03,082
I'm worried this Ferragamo thing
is not going to go away.

112
00:11:03,853 --> 00:11:06,242
Let me handle the Ferragamo situation, Mike.

113
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:09,803
You just make sure the rest
of the day gets back on track.

114
00:11:11,013 --> 00:11:14,005
Did I hear you say
something about Dr Ferragamo?

115
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:18,364
- There was a fire in his office.
- I'll get on this other stuff.

116
00:11:18,453 --> 00:11:20,205
- Thanks, Mike.
- Dad?

117
00:11:22,293 --> 00:11:24,284
Keith, I'm sorry.

118
00:11:26,373 --> 00:11:28,443
Dr Ferragamo died.

119
00:11:28,533 --> 00:11:31,001
- When?
- About an hour ago.

120
00:11:33,013 --> 00:11:34,810
We just found out.

121
00:11:34,893 --> 00:11:37,851
Wait. I don't get it. What kind of fire?

122
00:11:37,933 --> 00:11:40,652
We're still waiting to hear the details.

123
00:11:41,693 --> 00:11:43,684
What's goin' on?

124
00:11:44,413 --> 00:11:48,850
Are you saying that my psychiatrist,
Dr Ferragamo, was involved in this?

125
00:11:48,933 --> 00:11:53,006
That he told Maureen Kingsley
something I said to him during a session?

126
00:11:53,093 --> 00:11:56,529
Is that how this whole story
about Lyle Gibson started?

127
00:11:56,613 --> 00:11:59,081
It seems that way.

128
00:11:59,173 --> 00:12:02,051
But he died in a fire an hour ago?

129
00:12:02,133 --> 00:12:04,522
It was an accident.

130
00:12:04,613 --> 00:12:07,764
- No. I don't believe this.
- Keith, look.

131
00:12:10,973 --> 00:12:14,249
- We have to let it go right now.
- Let it go?

132
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,927
- You mean cover it up.
- There's nothing to cover up.

133
00:12:17,013 --> 00:12:18,731
Sure there is!

134
00:12:18,813 --> 00:12:22,123
Somebody didn't want him to talk
because it'll hurt your campaign.

135
00:12:22,213 --> 00:12:25,205
What would you like me to do?

136
00:12:25,293 --> 00:12:27,284
- Go to the police?
- I can't.

137
00:12:27,373 --> 00:12:31,446
I don't get it. What was all that stuff
you said before about trusting the system?

138
00:12:31,533 --> 00:12:32,648
I trust the system.

139
00:12:32,733 --> 00:12:35,930
When my hind part's on the line.
But when it's your campaign?

140
00:12:36,013 --> 00:12:40,245
My campaign's been on the line
ever since you lied to me about Lyle Gibson.

141
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:44,770
I don't understand. You've been on me
all night to keep quiet about Gibson's death.

142
00:12:44,853 --> 00:12:47,970
This isn't about Lyle Gibson any more, is it?

143
00:12:48,053 --> 00:12:50,521
I might have been involved in Gibson's death,

144
00:12:50,613 --> 00:12:53,525
but somebody murdered Dr Ferragamo,
and they have to pay!

145
00:12:53,613 --> 00:12:55,763
Keith.

146
00:12:55,853 --> 00:12:58,492
He meant something to me.

147
00:12:58,973 --> 00:13:01,168
That's right.

148
00:13:01,253 --> 00:13:05,610
Look, I was in real pain, and Dr Ferragamo
was the only one there for me.

149
00:13:05,693 --> 00:13:09,242
So we're not gonna pretend like
this thing never happened, OK?

150
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:12,803
- Keith...
- No! You don't know how messed up I was.

151
00:13:14,373 --> 00:13:16,933
I wouldn't have made it without him.

152
00:13:18,693 --> 00:13:21,571
Just give me a little time.

153
00:13:21,653 --> 00:13:24,372
Let me get to the bottom of what happened.

154
00:13:24,933 --> 00:13:29,085
If there was foul play,
I promise you, we'll come forward.

155
00:13:29,493 --> 00:13:33,122
- Why can't we come forward now?
- Because we can't!

156
00:13:36,293 --> 00:13:39,365
Son, I love you.

157
00:13:40,453 --> 00:13:44,082
You have to know
I'm doing what's best for you.

158
00:13:46,773 --> 00:13:49,162
You have to know it.

159
00:14:07,133 --> 00:14:10,045
- Good afternoon, Tony.
- . Chapelle.

160
00:14:14,933 --> 00:14:17,731
Looks like they're bringing in the big guns.

161
00:14:18,893 --> 00:14:21,168
What do you think they're gonna do to Jack?

162
00:14:21,253 --> 00:14:23,721
Not gonna name a street after him.

163
00:15:00,813 --> 00:15:03,373
- Hey, Jack.
- Ryan. It's good to see you.

164
00:15:04,453 --> 00:15:07,525
I've got five priority cases
on my desk this morning.

165
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:11,564
- Your name's on each one.
- I can imagine that.

166
00:15:12,413 --> 00:15:15,928
- Look, I just wanted to say...
- Hang on.

167
00:15:21,173 --> 00:15:22,845
You were saying?

168
00:15:30,093 --> 00:15:35,121
At approximately 12.15
I got a phone call from Agent Nina Myers,

169
00:15:35,213 --> 00:15:37,681
telling me to assemble the team at CTU.

170
00:15:39,293 --> 00:15:41,568
District Manager Walsh...

171
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:47,644
Where's Teri Bauer?

172
00:15:48,693 --> 00:15:51,127
- I don't know.
- Who are you with?

173
00:15:52,133 --> 00:15:54,522
FBI. And you?

174
00:15:55,653 --> 00:15:59,009
- CTU.
- Just waiting for the rest of my debrief team.

175
00:15:59,093 --> 00:16:04,087
We're interrogating some of the injured
prisoners they're bringing into the clinic.

176
00:16:04,893 --> 00:16:06,372
Thanks.

177
00:16:08,813 --> 00:16:11,008
I'm with CTU. Where's Teri Bauer?

178
00:16:11,093 --> 00:16:14,130
- She was moved to room seven.
- Thank you.

179
00:16:29,813 --> 00:16:31,041
Teri?

180
00:16:32,973 --> 00:16:36,249
- There you are.
- Nina. I didn't know you were gonna be here.

181
00:16:36,693 --> 00:16:38,172
Yeah.

182
00:16:38,853 --> 00:16:42,892
Hi, Kim. We didn't officially meet.
I'm Nina Myers. I work with your dad.

183
00:16:43,213 --> 00:16:44,805
Hi.

184
00:16:44,893 --> 00:16:47,168
I'm just so glad the two of you are OK.

185
00:16:47,253 --> 00:16:52,964
I'll be here until you're done. So if you need
anything, I'll be down in the waiting room.

186
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:56,204
Nina, what's happening with Jack?

187
00:16:56,293 --> 00:16:58,602
He's being questioned.

188
00:16:58,693 --> 00:17:00,649
- Is he in trouble?
- That depends.

189
00:17:00,733 --> 00:17:05,249
He broke a few laws, but he did it to save
you and Kim, so I think they'll understand.

190
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:08,291
If he doesn't piss 'em off first.

191
00:17:08,373 --> 00:17:10,284
My thoughts exactly.

192
00:17:12,293 --> 00:17:15,285
Guess you know Jack
just about as well as I do, huh?

193
00:17:16,853 --> 00:17:20,562
I'm sending someone to your house
to pick up some clean clothes.

194
00:17:21,133 --> 00:17:24,921
What's gonna happen when we get released
from here? Why can't we just go home?

195
00:17:25,013 --> 00:17:29,086
Until we know exactly what happened,
we'll take every precaution to keep you safe.

196
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:31,562
When do we get to see my dad?

197
00:17:31,653 --> 00:17:36,966
I don't know. A lot of things have to happen
first. Some people will wanna talk to you.

198
00:17:37,053 --> 00:17:42,685
Division, Secret Service, us.
Cos, you see, this wasn't a simple crime.

199
00:17:42,773 --> 00:17:47,767
This was a terrorist conspiracy, and
unfortunately you were in the middle of it.

200
00:17:48,413 --> 00:17:50,802
But that's over now.

201
00:17:52,733 --> 00:17:54,724
- Nina, wait.
- Yeah?

202
00:17:54,813 --> 00:17:57,168
I don't know the details about last night,

203
00:17:57,253 --> 00:18:01,166
but I understand you're a big part
of the reason why we're still alive.

204
00:18:01,253 --> 00:18:02,971
So thank you.

205
00:18:04,373 --> 00:18:06,364
Sure.

206
00:18:06,453 --> 00:18:08,444
I'll be out here.

207
00:19:08,173 --> 00:19:09,811
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

208
00:19:09,893 --> 00:19:12,691
Nina Myers, CTU. Is that man FBI?

209
00:19:12,773 --> 00:19:16,846
- Yeah. He's with me.
- He was in three. I'd like to speak with him.

210
00:19:16,933 --> 00:19:19,606
Sure. But he wasn't in three. We just got here.

211
00:19:20,173 --> 00:19:21,652
Stu?

212
00:19:24,533 --> 00:19:27,491
- Who else is here from the bureau?
- It's just the two of us.

213
00:19:27,573 --> 00:19:30,371
- Are you sure?
- Of course I'm sure.

214
00:19:49,453 --> 00:19:52,126
The reason I didn't call CTU
immediately for backup?

215
00:19:52,213 --> 00:19:56,525
I was worried things could get out of control.
My wife and daughter were in the compound.

216
00:19:56,613 --> 00:19:59,605
- But you did eventually call?
- Yes. Yes.

217
00:19:59,693 --> 00:20:03,049
The second Teri and Kim were with me,
I called Alberta Green.

218
00:20:03,133 --> 00:20:05,886
You did what any loving father would do.

219
00:20:05,973 --> 00:20:11,411
Unfortunately, as you know, our procedures
don't allow for any deviation from protocol.

220
00:20:11,493 --> 00:20:14,212
I can't reinstate you, Jack.

221
00:20:14,293 --> 00:20:17,649
Have you heard a thing I've said?
D'you understand what's happening?

222
00:20:17,733 --> 00:20:22,204
Senator Palmer is still in great danger.
Now that my family are safe, I can help you.

223
00:20:22,293 --> 00:20:25,842
As of now, your case will be put in
the hands of the Justice Department.

224
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:27,525
Justice Department!

225
00:20:27,613 --> 00:20:33,085
Yes, under the circumstances, I had to break
the rules of procedure to protect my family!

226
00:20:33,173 --> 00:20:37,166
But I never deviated from my assignment
to protect Palmer. And you know that!

227
00:20:37,253 --> 00:20:42,168
Yes, I know that. That's what might keep you
from going to prison, but that's not my call.

228
00:20:42,253 --> 00:20:46,451
We don't have time for this. I have come
in contact with suspects who are still at large.

229
00:20:46,533 --> 00:20:51,129
And I guarantee you, they have a contingency
plan. I am a resource. I can identify them.

230
00:20:51,213 --> 00:20:56,651
You wanna arrest me, do that later. But let me
help Palmer get through the rest of this day!

231
00:20:57,413 --> 00:21:02,043
- I'll ask Alberta if she wants you...
- She's been here for four hours, Ryan!

232
00:21:08,893 --> 00:21:09,928
Chapelle.

233
00:21:10,013 --> 00:21:12,481
Is Nina Myers
cleared to talk with Bauer?

234
00:21:12,573 --> 00:21:14,006
- Yeah.
- I'll patch you through.

235
00:21:14,093 --> 00:21:16,084
That's fine.

236
00:21:17,773 --> 00:21:20,765
OK. We're through here. It's Nina.

237
00:21:30,733 --> 00:21:33,531
- Keep him company.
- Yes, sir.

238
00:21:34,853 --> 00:21:36,923
- Hey. It's Jack.
- How's it going?

239
00:21:37,013 --> 00:21:39,891
They're handing me over
to the Justice Department.

240
00:21:39,973 --> 00:21:43,409
- Did you explain why you did what you did?
- Yes, of course I did.

241
00:21:43,493 --> 00:21:47,452
I think Alberta Green's trying to make
a career move. How's Teri and Kim?

242
00:21:47,533 --> 00:21:50,252
They seem OK, considering
what they've been through.

243
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:52,289
How long will they have to stay there?

244
00:21:52,373 --> 00:21:55,683
A couple of hours, then they'll be
transferred for questioning.

245
00:21:55,773 --> 00:22:00,767
Nina, look, I can't thank you enough
for being there. Really, I appreciate it.

246
00:22:02,813 --> 00:22:04,485
- Nina?
- Yeah, I'm here.

247
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:06,564
What's wrong?

248
00:22:08,693 --> 00:22:11,924
When Walsh said someone in the agency
was working against Palmer,

249
00:22:12,013 --> 00:22:14,163
did you sense it was more than one person?

250
00:22:14,253 --> 00:22:19,327
He didn't say, but I've been thinking about
this too. Someone had to recruit Jamey.

251
00:22:19,413 --> 00:22:24,487
So for now you have to assume that someone
else is on the inside. Maybe not CTU.

252
00:22:24,573 --> 00:22:28,612
District, Division, maybe Secret Service.
Why? What are you thinking?

253
00:22:28,693 --> 00:22:31,412
I just wanna make sure that
Teri and Kim are safe here.

254
00:22:31,493 --> 00:22:33,848
What do you mean? At the clinic?

255
00:22:33,933 --> 00:22:36,242
- Yeah.
- Why wouldn't they be?

256
00:22:36,333 --> 00:22:40,121
I don't know. I'm just exhausted
and probably getting paranoid.

257
00:22:40,613 --> 00:22:44,049
- What's going on there?
- Nothing, Jack. Don't worry.

258
00:22:44,133 --> 00:22:48,331
- I will make sure that they are safe here.
- OK. Thanks. Can I talk to them?

259
00:22:48,413 --> 00:22:52,645
- They're being examined right now.
- OK. Get back to me as soon as they can talk.

260
00:22:52,733 --> 00:22:54,405
- Yeah.
- OK. Thank you.

261
00:22:57,773 --> 00:23:01,083
Any more information on
the backup plan to assassinate Palmer?

262
00:23:01,173 --> 00:23:05,325
The information that came in matched
what we got from Division's database.

263
00:23:05,413 --> 00:23:08,962
- Looks like things are falling into place.
- Give me the headlines.

264
00:23:09,053 --> 00:23:13,490
Three shooters, possibly hired to kill Palmer
in case the breakfast attempt failed.

265
00:23:13,573 --> 00:23:16,849
There's Jovan Myovic.
Entered the country two days ago.

266
00:23:16,933 --> 00:23:20,721
Mishko Suba, also from the Balkans,
came in three days ago through Florida.

267
00:23:20,813 --> 00:23:23,168
And the other one?

268
00:23:23,253 --> 00:23:26,211
- No name yet.
- Keep looking.

269
00:23:26,293 --> 00:23:30,844
If he's connected with the other two, we need
to know where he is and what he's doing.

270
00:24:04,773 --> 00:24:07,651
Let's leave it right there!
Get the equipment in the shed.

271
00:24:07,733 --> 00:24:11,521
I'll be in to brief you on our exit strategy.
Let's move it out!

272
00:24:17,973 --> 00:24:20,123
- . Drazen, it's Kevin.
- Yes?

273
00:24:20,213 --> 00:24:23,444
- We just got to the transfer point.
- What about Gaines?

274
00:24:23,533 --> 00:24:25,842
- He's dead.
- I see.

275
00:24:25,933 --> 00:24:29,687
Listen,. Drazen,
when Gaines hired me for this,

276
00:24:29,773 --> 00:24:33,448
I told him there were some defects
in his plan that could be exploited.

277
00:24:33,533 --> 00:24:38,527
Not to say I told you so, but I'm not surprised
that any of this happened the way it did.

278
00:24:38,613 --> 00:24:41,685
- Is there a point to any of this?
- Yes.

279
00:24:41,773 --> 00:24:45,925
- Yes. I can fix it for you.
- Interesting. And how can you do that?

280
00:24:46,453 --> 00:24:49,251
I've done this before. I know people.

281
00:24:49,973 --> 00:24:53,124
When I was working for the DEA in Florida,

282
00:24:53,213 --> 00:24:56,762
I was able to get to a witness
that no one else could find.

283
00:24:56,853 --> 00:25:01,131
12 hours later he was dead. Problem solved.
You get what I'm saying?

284
00:25:01,213 --> 00:25:06,082
I appreciate the offer, Kevin,
but as you Americans so often say,

285
00:25:06,173 --> 00:25:08,641
plan B is already in effect.

286
00:25:10,733 --> 00:25:12,883
What does that mean?

287
00:25:12,973 --> 00:25:15,123
Hello?! Drazen!

288
00:26:27,333 --> 00:26:29,722
Get... away from me.

289
00:26:34,013 --> 00:26:36,481
Is there anything left in the truck?

290
00:26:37,293 --> 00:26:38,885
Go to hell.

291
00:27:02,613 --> 00:27:06,845
Get me three copies of this report
as soon as you can get it.

292
00:27:07,533 --> 00:27:10,411
Are we saying Palmer
should stay in for the duration?

293
00:27:10,493 --> 00:27:13,690
No. No, he's gotta get outta California now.

294
00:27:13,773 --> 00:27:17,652
The backup shooters are in LA
and they're gonna come after him.

295
00:27:17,733 --> 00:27:22,932
All right. Leave that with me. Let me look
it over one more time before I do anything.

296
00:27:23,653 --> 00:27:25,132
Tony?

297
00:27:26,293 --> 00:27:27,851
Yeah?

298
00:27:29,133 --> 00:27:32,125
Are you satisfied with your position here?

299
00:27:35,933 --> 00:27:36,729
Sure.

300
00:27:36,813 --> 00:27:41,489
Because I always had the impression you had
too much talent to be a number three at CTU.

301
00:27:46,053 --> 00:27:49,204
What do you want me to do, Alberta?

302
00:27:49,293 --> 00:27:52,524
See, that's what I like about you.
You get right to the point.

303
00:27:53,973 --> 00:27:58,125
Before Chapelle makes his final evaluation
of Jack, he'll wanna talk to you.

304
00:27:58,213 --> 00:28:00,886
- Why me?
- Because you called in the lockdown.

305
00:28:01,613 --> 00:28:07,085
Let's face it, Nina is hardly impartial when
it comes to Jack, and Chapelle knows that.

306
00:28:08,213 --> 00:28:11,091
And you want me to tell him what?

307
00:28:11,693 --> 00:28:15,288
The truth. That even though
Jack's family was in danger,

308
00:28:15,373 --> 00:28:20,766
there were ways he could have dealt with it
without compromising the integrity of CTU.

309
00:28:21,973 --> 00:28:24,487
If Jack had confided
in you from the beginning,

310
00:28:24,573 --> 00:28:29,852
you never would have had to call George
Mason to lock things down. Am I right?

311
00:28:45,613 --> 00:28:47,171
Jack?

312
00:28:47,253 --> 00:28:48,891
Alberta.

313
00:28:48,973 --> 00:28:51,248
Chapelle asked me to debrief you, personally.

314
00:28:51,333 --> 00:28:52,652
Fine.

315
00:28:52,733 --> 00:28:56,646
I have to tell you, this is your turf.
I feel uncomfortable debriefing you.

316
00:28:56,733 --> 00:28:58,564
Don't. It's quite all right.

317
00:28:59,613 --> 00:29:01,490
It's pointless to ask you questions.

318
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:05,282
Why don't you tell me what you think
I need to know? Save us some time.

319
00:29:05,373 --> 00:29:07,648
I went through the events with Chapelle.

320
00:29:07,733 --> 00:29:12,170
What you need are the threads and IDs
so you'll know how to proceed tactically.

321
00:29:12,253 --> 00:29:15,563
- Do you mind?
- No. But before we start, I need something.

322
00:29:16,733 --> 00:29:19,293
- What's that?
- I wanna phone my wife and daughter.

323
00:29:19,373 --> 00:29:23,685
They don't know what's going on with me
over here. I wanna ease their minds.

324
00:29:23,773 --> 00:29:26,241
Sorry, Jack. I can't do that.

325
00:29:27,253 --> 00:29:32,373
So why don't we dispense with the "Are you
all right, Jack? I feel uncomfortable" crap?

326
00:29:34,373 --> 00:29:37,763
OK. You wanna talk straight?
Fine. Don't handle me.

327
00:29:39,973 --> 00:29:41,645
Tell me what you know.

328
00:29:41,733 --> 00:29:46,124
You need to get ahold of Langley. Have them
open up their Balkan terrorist database.

329
00:29:46,213 --> 00:29:47,248
Why the Balkans?

330
00:29:47,333 --> 00:29:50,689
The people behind the hit on Palmer
are financed by a Ted Cofell.

331
00:29:50,773 --> 00:29:54,163
He was a banker with family
connections in that area of Europe.

332
00:29:54,253 --> 00:29:55,686
Was?

333
00:29:55,773 --> 00:29:57,570
He died three hours ago.

334
00:29:59,213 --> 00:30:00,851
Keep talking.

335
00:30:00,933 --> 00:30:05,927
The money that we traced came back to Ted
Cofell Industries, which is based here in LA.

336
00:30:12,373 --> 00:30:15,251
- CTU. Almeida.
- Tony, I have a problem.

337
00:30:15,333 --> 00:30:19,121
20 minutes ago a man identified himself
to me as FBI, but I know he's lying.

338
00:30:19,213 --> 00:30:20,123
How d'you know?

339
00:30:20,213 --> 00:30:24,252
Cos I met the only two FBI agents assigned
here, and they knew nothing about him.

340
00:30:24,333 --> 00:30:26,403
Maybe the right hand's
not talking to the left.

341
00:30:26,493 --> 00:30:30,884
I don't think it's that. Can you send someone
over? I need to pull some prints off a phone.

342
00:30:30,973 --> 00:30:32,372
Sure. Anything else?

343
00:30:32,453 --> 00:30:35,411
- No, that's it. Just hurry.
- All right. You got it.

344
00:30:40,293 --> 00:30:43,126
And the senator wanted
to get your approval on these.

345
00:30:43,213 --> 00:30:46,046
- What are they?
- The photographs for Time magazine.

346
00:30:46,133 --> 00:30:48,522
Oh, right. I wanted to see those.

347
00:30:49,213 --> 00:30:51,773
- These are nice.
- Uh-huh.

348
00:30:51,853 --> 00:30:54,686
- Mom?
- Hey. Um...

349
00:30:54,773 --> 00:30:57,571
- Use that one, Patty.
- OK. Thanks.

350
00:30:58,533 --> 00:31:00,922
So what's goin' on?

351
00:31:02,133 --> 00:31:04,249
- I talked to Dad.
- And?

352
00:31:04,333 --> 00:31:06,005
And I'm a little confused.

353
00:31:06,093 --> 00:31:11,292
All night he's been trying to convince me to
air this thing about Nicole's rape and about...

354
00:31:11,373 --> 00:31:13,967
No. We don't need to worry
about that right now.

355
00:31:14,053 --> 00:31:16,521
No, that's just it. We do have to.

356
00:31:17,533 --> 00:31:19,683
I know about Dr Ferragamo.

357
00:31:22,933 --> 00:31:26,050
- And I know that fire wasn't an accident.
- Keith.

358
00:31:26,133 --> 00:31:28,931
- But Dad wants to keep it quiet.
- Don't get worked up.

359
00:31:29,013 --> 00:31:31,129
- I am worked up!
- Hey.

360
00:31:32,653 --> 00:31:35,406
Look, covering up an accident is one thing,

361
00:31:35,493 --> 00:31:37,882
but we're talkin' about murder.

362
00:31:39,253 --> 00:31:41,084
- I'm goin' to the police.
- No.

363
00:31:41,173 --> 00:31:44,688
- I'm sorry, I've made up my mind.
- You will listen to me, Keith!

364
00:31:50,853 --> 00:31:55,131
- It is not your decision to make.
- I can't believe you're saying this.

365
00:31:55,213 --> 00:31:58,888
That's because you don't know what
it takes to raise a family, to keep it safe.

366
00:31:58,973 --> 00:32:03,888
- What does this have to do with safe?
- It has everything to do with it.

367
00:32:03,973 --> 00:32:08,603
Nothing is simple in life.
Sometimes you just have to make a decision.

368
00:32:08,693 --> 00:32:12,049
That is what we did, and you will respect that.
Do you understand me?

369
00:32:12,133 --> 00:32:14,124
I understa...

370
00:32:16,133 --> 00:32:19,170
Have Patty pack up your things.
We have to leave the state.

371
00:32:19,253 --> 00:32:20,652
Why?

372
00:32:20,733 --> 00:32:24,203
They've done a threat assessment.
It's too dangerous for us to stay.

373
00:32:24,293 --> 00:32:27,444
- Where are we going?
- Nellis Air Force Base, in Nevada.

374
00:32:28,173 --> 00:32:30,733
- Have you discussed this with Mike?
- Of course.

375
00:32:30,813 --> 00:32:34,726
He believes this isn't a call they would make
unless the threat was imminent.

376
00:32:34,813 --> 00:32:39,603
I thought you said that the man from
the breakfast, Jack Bauer, was in custody.

377
00:32:39,693 --> 00:32:42,161
He is, but he may not be working alone.

378
00:32:43,133 --> 00:32:46,284
There are others... that are after me.

379
00:32:48,133 --> 00:32:50,852
So let's go.
Let's get our things together. Now.

380
00:32:50,933 --> 00:32:52,924
Come on, Keith. Keith.

381
00:33:08,853 --> 00:33:13,244
- You didn't call it in.
- My family were in danger, so I kept CTU out.

382
00:33:18,493 --> 00:33:21,371
- Yeah?
- Tony, Chapelle's ready for you.

383
00:33:21,453 --> 00:33:23,444
All right. Thanks.

384
00:33:39,853 --> 00:33:42,128
- Hey, Tony.
- Sir.

385
00:33:42,213 --> 00:33:44,204
Have a seat.

386
00:33:47,053 --> 00:33:51,092
As you know, we have an important decision
to make pretty soon about Jack Bauer,

387
00:33:51,173 --> 00:33:54,563
whether or not to pursue
criminal and disciplinary charges.

388
00:33:55,293 --> 00:33:58,046
- I understand.
- I'm not gonna lie to you.

389
00:33:58,733 --> 00:34:04,524
This may boil down to your testimony, as
you seem to be the most impartial observer.

390
00:34:08,453 --> 00:34:11,047
Let me save you some time,.Chapelle.

391
00:34:13,573 --> 00:34:16,041
I'm not the biggest fan of Jack Bauer.

392
00:34:17,213 --> 00:34:19,886
I don't agree with the way
he delegates authority,

393
00:34:19,973 --> 00:34:22,771
and I don't like the way he runs operations.

394
00:34:24,933 --> 00:34:29,245
But since midnight last night,

395
00:34:30,133 --> 00:34:33,808
you won't get me to disapprove
of a single action he's taken.

396
00:34:39,933 --> 00:34:41,685
Fair enough.

397
00:34:58,133 --> 00:35:00,283
You talked to Nicole?

398
00:35:00,373 --> 00:35:04,810
Yeah. They're taking care of her.
They're gonna meet us at the airport.

399
00:35:04,893 --> 00:35:07,282
Yeah. I'll tell him. Thanks.

400
00:35:07,933 --> 00:35:09,764
That was the Pentagon.

401
00:35:09,853 --> 00:35:13,892
Remember after the incident at the breakfast
you asked me to check out Jack Bauer?

402
00:35:13,973 --> 00:35:15,964
Who is he?

403
00:35:19,293 --> 00:35:21,727
He used to be in Special Forces.

404
00:35:21,813 --> 00:35:25,647
Led a six-man team into Kosovo
a couple of years ago.

405
00:35:28,373 --> 00:35:31,206
That's what it was.

406
00:35:31,293 --> 00:35:32,965
The Drazen mission.

407
00:35:33,053 --> 00:35:36,489
Yeah. He hand-picked
his men and trained them.

408
00:35:37,013 --> 00:35:39,004
Only Bauer survived.

409
00:35:40,373 --> 00:35:43,331
He blames me for the loss of his team.

410
00:35:43,413 --> 00:35:45,802
That's what this is about.

411
00:36:05,613 --> 00:36:09,003
Patty, can you get this to Mrs. Palmer?
I didn't have time to pack it.

412
00:36:09,093 --> 00:36:12,165
- Aren't you coming with me?
- No. I'm taking a later flight.

413
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:16,292
I have an aunt in town. I promised my mom
I'd visit. She's in a nursing home.

414
00:36:16,373 --> 00:36:18,170
Sure.

415
00:36:19,853 --> 00:36:25,485
OK. We need to get destinations on that one.
Make sure you fax that to the other office.

416
00:36:36,053 --> 00:36:38,692
- Hold the elevator, please.
- Sure.

417
00:37:17,133 --> 00:37:19,363
- Elizabeth?
- I can't stay long.

418
00:37:20,213 --> 00:37:22,283
Then we shouldn't waste any time.

419
00:37:46,053 --> 00:37:48,044
Anything?

420
00:37:49,013 --> 00:37:52,483
- Nothing.
- That can't be. I saw him holding the phone.

421
00:37:52,573 --> 00:37:55,610
- Those prints have been wiped off.
- It doesn't make sense.

422
00:37:55,693 --> 00:37:58,048
Housekeeping didn't come in here.

423
00:37:58,133 --> 00:38:02,092
This wasn't housekeeping. There's not
a single print anywhere on that phone.

424
00:38:02,173 --> 00:38:04,562
It was done by a professional.

425
00:38:09,093 --> 00:38:11,891
Yes. The weapons would be
consistent with that scenario.

426
00:38:14,093 --> 00:38:16,084
Excuse me.

427
00:38:17,213 --> 00:38:18,726
- Green.
- It's Nina.

428
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:21,852
Can I move Teri and Kim Bauer
to the safe house now?

429
00:38:21,933 --> 00:38:23,127
Are they done?

430
00:38:23,213 --> 00:38:26,808
Everything but the debrief,
but I can do that once we're over there.

431
00:38:26,893 --> 00:38:28,929
- Fine. Do it.
- Thank you.

432
00:38:31,173 --> 00:38:35,405
The ultrasound showed
the remnants of a small follicular cyst.

433
00:38:35,493 --> 00:38:38,485
- A cyst?
- Yes. It burst. That's what caused the pain.

434
00:38:38,573 --> 00:38:43,169
The good news is, it's the most common type
of ovarian cyst and it's completely benign.

435
00:38:43,253 --> 00:38:45,847
- Why did it burst?
- Could have been the assault.

436
00:38:45,933 --> 00:38:49,448
Can also happen when your uterus enlarges.
When was your last period?

437
00:38:49,533 --> 00:38:52,047
Last month. It's due some time this week.

438
00:38:52,133 --> 00:38:56,172
I'd like to do a pregnancy test,
just to rule it out.

439
00:38:56,253 --> 00:38:57,606
OK.

440
00:38:57,693 --> 00:39:00,253
Excuse me. Teri, we need to go now.
Get your things.

441
00:39:00,333 --> 00:39:02,369
We're not finished here yet.

442
00:39:02,453 --> 00:39:05,286
- Change of plan. We need to move.
- Is something wrong?

443
00:39:05,373 --> 00:39:08,683
We wanna get you and Kim
to the safe house now rather than wait.

444
00:39:08,773 --> 00:39:12,607
- Aren't we safe here?
- You're just not as contained as we'd like.

445
00:39:12,693 --> 00:39:14,684
Kim, come on.

446
00:39:17,773 --> 00:39:19,126
- Kim, get your things.
- Now?

447
00:39:19,213 --> 00:39:21,329
Now. Go.

448
00:39:36,373 --> 00:39:40,286
Here's the test I was telling you about.
