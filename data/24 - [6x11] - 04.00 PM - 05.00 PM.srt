1
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,193
As someone who has alienated followers
by choosing the unpopular course,

2
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,317
I suggest you tread carefully
among your people.

3
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,152
They will come after you.

4
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,152
Authorise clearance
for someone to get in the bunker.

5
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,549
Once he's inside, he'll carry the ball.

6
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,108
You mean kill the president?

7
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,713
- We have a cover.
- Who?

8
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,552
Assad.

9
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:37,076
Assad?
You're trying to make it look like he did this?

10
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,391
This is Lennox.
I need to speak to the ranking agent on site.

11
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,716
Carson wondered if you were playing us.

12
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,792
He didn't want to bring you into this,
but I defended you!

13
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,314
Nothing justifies the killing of a president.

14
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,757
The delivery-system software was
programmed for five high-priority targets.

15
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,118
Because of your carelessness,
we are now down to three.

16
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,634
More than enough for our needs, Gredenko.

17
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,359
I don't want to be exposed
any longer than necessary.

18
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,635
Do the authorities know we work with Fayed?

19
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,870
If they don't, they will soon.

20
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,316
<i>Bill, it's Jack. I've got the address
for Gredenko's safe house.</i>

21
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,197
A team will be there any minute.

22
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,954
<i>- (man) Clear!
- (man #2) Clear!</i>

23
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,918
<i>(man) Mr Buchanan,
there's no sign of Gredenko or anyone.</i>

24
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,957
That call. That was from Gredenko.
You tipped him off.

25
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,871
Now over half my team is dead!

26
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,997
It wasn't Gredenko on the phone.
Those aren't his men.

27
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:36,676
- Who sent them?!
- Your father. He has my son!

28
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:39,274
Take a look out the window, the adjacent roof.

29
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,434
<i>Dad, it's over. There is no empire to protect.
There is no legacy left.</i>

30
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,991
I'm the one you want.
You let Josh go, I will surrender.

31
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,433
You could have had it all.

32
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,080
What are you waiting for? Do it!

33
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,074
- Who am I talking to?
- It's Charles Logan, Jack.

34
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,470
<i>You must have exhausted
all your options to find Gredenko.</i>

35
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,755
Come and see me. Come alone.

36
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,914
<i>- (Gredenko) Go ahead.
- We're on our way.</i>

37
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,276
<i>- Good. We've arrived.
- Is the shipment there from Nevada?</i>

38
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,955
No, they are behind schedule,
but they will be here any moment.

39
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,031
How soon can you deploy once we arrive?

40
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,114
It will take us two hours to assemble
the delivery system and run diagnostics,

41
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,112
another hour to secure the payload.

42
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,713
That's longer than I'd hoped.

43
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,952
<i>Listen, we are working with
advanced technology. It can't be rushed.</i>

44
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:51,229
Remember, without us you'd be delivering
your payload in weeks instead of hours.

45
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,072
I haven't forgotten.

46
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:57,039
It seems necessary to remind you
now and then.

47
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:03,911
I'll be glad when we no longer
have to deal with these people.

48
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,596
They are living in the Dark Ages,
but they act like they own the world.

49
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,910
<i>I'd much rather be fighting them.</i>

50
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,230
If we succeed today, we'll never have to.

51
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:19,472
The Arabs and the West
can destroy each other.

52
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,797
The ambassadorjust arrived.
He's in the waiting area.

53
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,429
Good. Will Tom Lennox be joining us?

54
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:34,911
I spoke to Reed Pollock. He says Mr Lennox
is briefing the speaker and minority leader.

55
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,879
When Tom's finished,
tell him I want to see him, please.

56
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:42,635
Mr Ambassador.
It's good to see you again, sir.

57
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,236
Mr President, first allow me to express
my country's shock and deep regret

58
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,959
over the devastating attack in California.

59
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,519
Thank you, sir.

60
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:55,673
Of course, any assistance you may require,
you need only ask.

61
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,672
I'm asking you now, sir.
That's why you're here.

62
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,353
I believe you know Hamri Al-Assad.

63
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,193
Mr Ambassador.

64
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,114
I have never met Mr Assad in person,
but I know him by reputation.

65
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,113
His organisation has carried out
terrorist actions against my country.

66
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,839
Your own policies precipitated those actions.

67
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,388
That's yourjustification
for killing innocents?

68
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,119
We define "innocent" in different ways.

69
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:25,034
My own deputy lost his seven-year-old son
in one of your bombings.

70
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,352
- That is how I define "innocent".
- We are not here to air past differences.

71
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,317
Then why are we here?

72
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,358
In our last meeting, I told you
we were in contact with Assad.

73
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,396
You told me it was a positive step.

74
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,040
And I meant it at that time.
But I must confess,

75
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,069
after the last attack, I didn't expect
to see you in the same room with... him.

76
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,833
And I'm not so sure
I care to remain here either.

77
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:51,118
It is no more pleasant for me,
Your Excellency.

78
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,350
Would you give us a moment?

79
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,431
Certainly.

80
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,958
Assad is here because of the attack.
To be frank, sir,

81
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:05,511
we have three more nuclear weapons
loose in my country in the hands of terrorists.

82
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,397
- We didn't know that.
- In one hour,

83
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,278
Assad will go on television
and issue a statement.

84
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,920
It will be a global appeal to extremists.

85
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,633
He'll urge them to put down their arms and
engage in peaceful negotiation with the West.

86
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:26,190
Now, we are hoping to compel someone
to come forward with any information.

87
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:30,273
A petition like this, coming from Assad,
it could have a profound effect.

88
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,477
- We're counting on that.
- What do you need from us?

89
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,358
I want a statement of support
from your prime minister,

90
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,590
to follow right on the heels of Assad's.

91
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:43,231
Mr Assad is a polarising figure in my country.
A public endorsement of him

92
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:48,030
could have grave political consequences
for the prime minister.

93
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,395
Tell your prime minister
we have a carrier group

94
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,836
operating less than 25 miles off his shores.

95
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:59,357
My advisers are pressing me hard
for a military response,

96
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,113
so if we are attacked again...

97
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,270
I won't be able to hold them off.

98
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:08,035
- This is sounding like an ultimatum.
- It's not an ultimatum.

99
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:14,116
I'm merely pointing out the fact that neither
the prime minister nor I have the, uh, luxury

100
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:17,033
of worrying about the consequences
on a day like today.

101
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,877
I am putting my presidency on the line,
so please stop handing me excuses.

102
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,589
Get on the phone and make this happen.

103
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,230
Nadia, what's the status?

104
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:35,995
Turner's team completed a second sweep,
but the results were negative.

105
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,232
If Gredenko was using this address,
he did a good job of cleaning up after he left.

106
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:44,996
There was one operating land line. Morris
is checking to see if there was recent activity.

107
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,479
Morris.

108
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,754
- Morris!
- Yes.

109
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,798
- Any luck on the land line?
- No. I mean, not yet.

110
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:56,273
They must have used an inverter to stack
their calls, cos I can't get any records out.

111
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,557
Mr Buchanan, Jack Bauer's on the line.

112
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,629
Go ahead.

113
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,235
I'm near the airport
across the street from the Grandmont Hotel.

114
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:10,393
- I know. What's going on?
- It's complicated. Were the units dispatched?

115
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,153
Two units are on the way.
I'll have them meet you.

116
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:17,756
OK. I want you to contact LAPD. Have them
set up a five-block perimeter around the hotel.

117
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,912
- They need to take my father into custody.
- Your father?

118
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,719
He's involved.
I'll debrief you when we've got time.

119
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:28,032
- Did you pick up anything on Gredenko?
- No. Glasgow Street house was deserted.

120
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,395
We're processing it,
but we've come up empty.

121
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,552
- We can't be sure Gredenko was there.
- I might have a lead.

122
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,790
<i>- What is it?
- Charles Logan.</i>

123
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,154
Logan?

124
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,515
I spoke to him. He says he has information.

125
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,319
- How did you trace this to Logan?
- Through my father.

126
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,868
I need you to get me a helicopter
to take me to him.

127
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,315
<i>He's in Hidden Valley under house arrest.</i>

128
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,358
How? He was involved
in the murder of David Palmer.

129
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,955
He brokered a deal.
He plead guilty to obstruction ofjustice.

130
00:07:54,040 --> 00:08:00,434
The public never knew of his involvement
in aiding terrorists or Palmer's assassination.

131
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,795
- Get me a helicopter.
- We have one in the area.

132
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,440
Shouldn't take more than a couple of minutes.

133
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,999
Thank you.

134
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:10,629
- Marilyn.
- Jack. What happened?

135
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:15,748
My father escaped. I don't know where he is.
I want you both to go back to CTU.

136
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,877
Josh, I know there's a lot to explain,
and when this is over

137
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,078
you and I are gonna sit down
and I will talk you through what happened.

138
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,832
- OK.
- Let's go.

139
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,593
- You're not coming?
- No. Gredenko wasn't at the house.

140
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,069
I need to follow up another lead.

141
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,118
- Take these people back to CTU.
- Yes, sir.

142
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,156
Josh, get in.

143
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,755
Jack, thank you.

144
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,957
Thank you for saving my son.

145
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:45,634
He reminds me of you.

146
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,153
I can see it in his eyes.

147
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,517
- Marilyn, please, you have to go.
- OK.

148
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:09,235
I'll take those, sir. Step on through.

149
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,709
- Thank you.
- Sir.

150
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,351
Gentlemen.

151
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,029
Sign in, sirs.

152
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:31,795
- We'll need to process you again, Mr Carson.
- Of course.

153
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,833
- What's your occupation?
- Policy analyst with the Stanton Institute.

154
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:48,274
- State your business here.
- I'm here to consult on defence procedures.

155
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,828
At the request of Tom Lennox.

156
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,956
Test. One, two, three.

157
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,037
<i>(plays back) Test. One, two, three.</i>

158
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,598
- Thank you, sirs.
- Thank you.

159
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,070
Thank you.

160
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,351
We've got a problem.
Lennox tried to warn Secret Service about us.

161
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,671
- What?
- I stopped him before he alerted anyone,

162
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,557
but I had to restrain him.

163
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,915
You said that he was on board.

164
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,074
I thought that he was. Either he's changed
his mind or he's been playing us all along.

165
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,118
Regardless,
we're gonna have to deal with him.

166
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,759
Son of a bitch!

167
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:40,356
We've gotta move him.
I'm gonna need this space. Get me some tape.

168
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,029
Let's go. Over here.

169
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,918
Sit down. Hands behind your back.

170
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:05,395
We're gonna have to take care of him,
make it look like a suicide.

171
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,390
OK.

172
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,994
No. No.

173
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,833
Eliminating Palmer
is for the good of the country,

174
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,993
it's the only way to get him out of office.
Killing Tom Lennox only benefits us.

175
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:19,311
- We don't have any choice.
- Tom Lennox is a very smart man.

176
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:22,551
I think that once Vice President Daniels
is holding the reins

177
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,155
and enacting the policies
that Lennox himself created,

178
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,959
we can convince him to keep quiet.

179
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,952
I'm not gambling my life
on Lennox's good judgment.

180
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,555
It's a risk, but it is a risk
that I am willing to take.

181
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:40,760
We're not cold-blooded murderers,
we're just trying to save our country.

182
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:46,118
We do not have time to resolve this. Assad
goes before the cameras within an hour.

183
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,839
You said it would take 25 minutes
to assemble this?

184
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,514
- 25 to 30.
- Then you'd better get started now.

185
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,878
To frame Assad for the assassination, this
bomb has to explode when they're together.

186
00:11:55,960 --> 00:12:00,715
We're never going to have
a better chance than now.

187
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,472
Reed.

188
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,993
<i>(sighs) Yes, Melinda.</i>

189
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,640
I'm still waiting for the stats
Tom promised me.

190
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,917
Tom just emailed them to you.
They should be on your screen.

191
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,718
OK.

192
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,916
By the way, is Tom in his office?

193
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,911
Uh, no. No.

194
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,869
Um, Tom is down in conference B.
He's meeting with some policy analysts.

195
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:53,111
I just came from Conference B.
Secret Service is in there.

196
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,998
Well, they must have
switched to another room, then.

197
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:59,311
Listen, I'll try to track Tom down for you.

198
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:12,470
- What is it?
- I have to uplink traffic vectors to the sub net.

199
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:16,314
I've been trying, I've been trying,
and itjust won't go through.

200
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,278
- Check your SIP adaptor.
- What about my SIP adaptor?

201
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,875
You've specified the wrong slot assignment.

202
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:26,919
Oh. What an idiot. Thank you. That'll work.

203
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:34,112
- Did you call your sponsor?
- I'm getting tired of the third degree.

204
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,839
I didn't tell anyone you took a drink.

205
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:41,072
- I didn't take a drink. I spat it out.
- You promised you'd call your sponsor.

206
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,991
- And I did.
- Well?

207
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:47,915
We had this long talk.
I feel a lot better. Really.

208
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,956
You're not acting like it.

209
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,191
Why don't we install a breathalyser?
Will that satisfy you?

210
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,191
I just wanna make sure you're OK.

211
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:58,113
I helped terrorists arm a nuclear bomb today.
I'm not OK.

212
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,272
That doesn't mean to say I can't do my job.

213
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:06,275
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to swap out this server port.

214
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:22,150
- Where's Morris?
- He's swapping out a server port.

215
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,676
He's supposed to be
checking on Gredenko's land line.

216
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:31,118
Well, he's juggling a lot right now.
We're all trying to pick up the slack.

217
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,157
- I'm wondering if it's more than that.
- What?

218
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,835
He's been tortured. He's under stress.
Maybe he should be pulled.

219
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,708
Yeah, he's a little upset, but he's
better than 90% of the tech people here.

220
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,234
We need Morris on the floor.

221
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,390
All right, but I'm keeping my eye on him.
If I see anything I don't like, I go to Buchanan.

222
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,277
Fine.

223
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:13,435
<i>Hi, this is Jeannie. I'm not here right now.
Please leave a message and I'll call you back.</i>

224
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:18,389
Hi, Jeannie. This is Chloe O'Brian.
You don't know me, but I'm Morris's ex-wife.

225
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:24,555
Could you call me back as soon as possible?
It's important. I'm at 310-597-3781. Thank you.

226
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:28,269
Nadia. Jack will be arriving
at Logan's estate any moment.

227
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,670
I want TAC teams on alert
and prepped for redeployment.

228
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:35,878
We're out of leads. Let's hope
Jack can get something from Logan.

229
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,869
Can we have a moment, please?

230
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:00,275
It must have been hard for you to find out
about your father's involvement.

231
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:04,717
I'm not here to talk about my father. Dmitri
Gredenko, what do you know about him?

232
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,678
I know Gredenko supplied Fayed
with five Russian nukes,

233
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:11,355
one of which exploded in Valencia
and one of which you managed to disarm.

234
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,035
- So that leaves us three we need to recover.
- That's correct.

235
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,830
I get regular intelligence updates
and I still have my sources.

236
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,356
So, you need Gredenko to find Fayed.

237
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,989
- Can you help us?
- Yes, I can.

238
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:33,036
But you want some kind of plea agreement.
You're unbelievable.

239
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,074
I don't blame you for thinking that, Jack.

240
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:40,436
But I want you to know
I'm not the same man I was two years ago,

241
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:46,072
just as you're not the man who was dragged
away and thrown into a Chinese prison.

242
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,879
I've changed.
I've had time to think about what I did.

243
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:52,316
I've had time to reconnect to my faith.

244
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:56,234
So, no, I don't want a pardon
and I wouldn't accept it if it was offered to me.

245
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,197
- What do you want?
- Nothing.

246
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:02,639
I want to give you the information you need,
with no conditions.

247
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,517
I'm listening.

248
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:07,797
I never dealt with Gredenko directly,
but I know how to find him.

249
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,711
- How?
- Through Anatoly Markov.

250
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,360
He's a Russian consul general here in LA.

251
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:16,194
CTU contacted the consul general
when we saw Gredenko's name on the list.

252
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:20,876
<i>- He denied knowledge of his whereabouts.
- (chuckles)</i>

253
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,598
Markov's lying.

254
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:26,229
- He's been the liaison for Gredenko for years.
- Liaison for what?

255
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:30,950
For business concerns looking to acquire
the products that Gredenko provides.

256
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:34,032
No, don't. Don't make the wrong play, Jack.

257
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:37,954
If you go down official channels,
you'll end up in a hopeless maze.

258
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:42,909
Markov has friends in the Russian
government who can protect him indefinitely.

259
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:49,155
If you wanna access what he knows right
now, you need to go through back channels.

260
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,350
- What back channels?
- Me.

261
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,000
I'm your best chance to get the information.

262
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:00,755
- What are you proposing?
- That I speak to Markov myself, in person.

263
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,798
- Why would Markov talk to you?
- Because I have leverage.

264
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:07,270
Markov was involved in the conspiracy
that put me where I am today.

265
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:11,319
I didn't give him up, but he knows I still can.

266
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,797
I don't trust you.

267
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:23,556
If you wanna find Gredenko,
maybe it's time you started.

268
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,835
- Go ahead, Jack.
- Mr President, thank you for taking my call.

269
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:51,151
<i>- You said it was urgent.
- We have a way of finding Gredenko.</i>

270
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:54,391
It was my understanding we lost Gredenko.
Do we have a new lead?

271
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,913
Yes, sir.

272
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,675
Mr President, the lead is Charles Logan.

273
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,479
- Logan?
- Yes, sir. I'm with him now.

274
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:07,872
He claims his administration had dealings
with Gredenko and he has a contact.

275
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,235
- Who?
- Anatoly Markov.

276
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,880
The Russian consul in Los Angeles.

277
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,999
When we learned about Gredenko,
I called the consulate. That's a dead end.

278
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:20,629
Not to Logan. He wants to meet with Markov
in the consulate in person.

279
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,076
He says that's the only way
we can get the information we need.

280
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,597
Jack... Logan is under house arrest.

281
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,319
That's why I'm calling you, Mr President.

282
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:35,234
We need an executive order
granting Logan a temporary furlough.

283
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:39,393
Do you know what you're asking? Logan
was behind the assassination of my brother.

284
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,948
I would not call
if I didn't think it necessary.

285
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:46,477
I don't trust this man, Jack. This could be
some manoeuvre to gain his freedom.

286
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,028
I understand,
but we need to take a chance on him.

287
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:53,398
I will enter the consulate with Logan
as part of a security detail.

288
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:56,995
Sir, I believe we can trust him.
I think he's after something else.

289
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:00,675
- And what exactly would that be?
- Redemption.

290
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:04,435
Jack, I have no desire to facilitate
any kind of redemption for Logan.

291
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:10,675
Mr President, right now he's the only way
we're gonna find Gredenko and the bombs.

292
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,876
Put him on.

293
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,715
He wants to talk to you.

294
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,272
- Hello, Mr President.
- I want to hear it from your lips.

295
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,271
Tell me why I should agree to this.

296
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,954
Because you need me, Mr President.
Simple as that.

297
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:35,319
- I can talk to the Russian consul myself.
- You could, but you'd be wasting your time.

298
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:39,029
I have a prior relationship with Markov
that we can exploit.

299
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:44,240
With due respect, sir, I have more experience
of dealing with people of Markov's character.

300
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,551
You mean criminals like yourself?

301
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:51,918
I know how he thinks, and that's
an advantage you can't afford to ignore.

302
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,754
I want you to know that
if this is a move to escape custody,

303
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:59,196
I will commit the resources
of my administration to hunt you down.

304
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,875
I can assure you,
I have nothing like that in mind.

305
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:08,910
Several years ago I was in the same situation
and reached out to your brother... for counsel.

306
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,436
David helped me
successfully navigate that crisis.

307
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,954
Yes, he did.

308
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:19,510
And you repaid him by killing him.

309
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:26,995
I would like to do for you what your brother
did for me - help you get through this.

310
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,789
Don't assume
this represents forgiveness on my part.

311
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:36,396
I understand that, Mr President, but I hope,
over time, to earn your forgiveness.

312
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,471
<i>Put Jack on the phone.</i>

313
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:48,031
- Yes, Mr President.
- I'm granting the furlough.

314
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,438
- Just make it count, Jack.
- I'll do my best.

315
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,193
Thank you, Mr President.

316
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,794
This isn't easy for you, is it, Jack?

317
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,552
What?

318
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:04,668
The possibility I may not be
the same man you hated for so long.

319
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,309
You are late. Did you have any trouble?

320
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:27,598
We had to bypass a vehicle inspection
in Riverside. Other than that, a smooth trip.

321
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,399
Good. Let's have a look.

322
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,471
<i>(Russian)</i>

323
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:43,992
The US military has spent millions
to develop this drone.

324
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:51,152
Today American taxpayers
will get a demonstration

325
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:55,279
of what their money has produced.

326
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,949
According to Charles Logan,
Anatoly Markov,

327
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:02,077
the head of the consulate,
has information on Gredenko.

328
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:06,597
Logan and Bauer
are going to see Markov now.

329
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:11,993
I want comm locked on any communication
outside, and possibly inside, the consulate.

330
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:16,790
Are you still the lead on decoding diplomatic
communication leaving the consulate?

331
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:20,589
- Yes.
- I want you to hand that over to Chloe.

332
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:23,069
- Why?
- Because of what you've been through.

333
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:26,914
I'm not sure you can handle it,
and we can't afford any mistakes.

334
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,117
- Look, I'm...
- I want you to take over Morris's workload.

335
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,679
- Hold on...
- It's OK.

336
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:35,673
No. No, no. It's not OK. It's not OK.

337
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,910
I'd like to say something to everyone.

338
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,312
I'm very sorry that I gave
the reprogramming device to Fayed.

339
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,039
If I could take it back, I would, but I can't.

340
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:50,353
And if you don't think that I can do my job,
Mr Buchanan, then I should leave.

341
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:53,193
<i>But I can do my job.</i>

342
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,755
OK, Morris.

343
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:59,549
- Give your task full priority.
- Thank you.

344
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:03,918
Mr Buchanan,
I have to disagree with your decision.

345
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,676
- I'm sorry, but I don't think you're ready.
- Your objection is noted, Nadia.

346
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,033
My decision stands.

347
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:26,516
You're wasting your energy
and you're distracting me.

348
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:31,469
The president's gonna die.
There's nothing you can do about it.

349
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:38,435
They're starting to ask questions about Tom.
Are you on schedule?

350
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,909
I told you the bomb
would be ready in 30 minutes.

351
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,797
OK.

352
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,838
- Is there a problem?
- No.

353
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,593
You can't go soft on us now, Reed.

354
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:57,472
No, it's... it's just starting to hit me.

355
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:01,148
What we're about to do.

356
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:05,995
My God. We're killing
the President of the United States.

357
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:11,837
We're trying to save this country.
That's all you need to think about.

358
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:32,757
Chloe, look at the function prototypes
on Morris's report.

359
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:36,389
- What's the problem?
- Take a look.

360
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:41,271
- You mean the missing sectors?
- Yes, the missing sectors.

361
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,477
Did Buchanan make a mistake
by reinstating Morris too soon?

362
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:48,394
No. The Pentagon put a lock on these items.
I told him we'd backfill them later.

363
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,314
It's not gonna be to anyone's benefit
if you're covering for him.

364
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,118
I'm not.

365
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,751
Fine.

366
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:13,110
Morris, I need you to tell me the truth.
Have you been drinking?

367
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,509
I just had a couple of beers, love.

368
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,957
Don't be sarcastic. Your data merge
is incomplete. I had to cover for you...

369
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:23,237
- Wait. What was incomplete?
- Look...

370
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:29,076
For crying out loud. These are irrelevant.
I only fill them in when I file my final report.

371
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,071
Nadia wants these completed.

372
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:36,837
Nadia only wants to prove to Buchanan that
she was right and that I shouldn't be here.

373
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:42,278
- No one is out to get you.
- Look, even I know that I shouldn't be here.

374
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:45,033
There's a big part of me
that wants to go home,

375
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,032
crawl into bed
and forget this day ever happened.

376
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:51,271
But I'm staying because CTU needs me.

- We're out of options. I have to trust him.

I know you talked to Morris earlier

00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:04,712
and against your confidentiality agreement,
but I'm really worried about him.

I'm sorry. I haven't spoken to Morris

- She hasn't talked to you in three years.
- Are you crazy?

419
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,599
I trusted you. I put my job on the line.
You lied to me.

He's my sponsor. I called him,

I don't know what to say.
I was worried about you.

Marching into a men's room isn't worried,

00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:17,396
If you try to call out,
Carson will kill you and I cannot stop him.

442
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,516
You understand?

443
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,397
OK.

444
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,951
You've got to put a stop to this.

445
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:32,716
No. Mr Lennox, when this is done
and the president is out of the way,

446
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,360
I think that you will see things differently.

447
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:39,399
I think you will see
that this is better for our country.

448
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:42,756
No. You're going to
destroy this country, Reed.

449
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:45,115
You're just as bad as Fayed.

450
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:51,798
No, no. There must have been a moment
when you were on board with this plan.

451
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:56,234
Were you playing us from the beginning?

452
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:59,790
Were you?
Or did you change your mind along the way?

453
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,996
I need to know.

454
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:06,915
Then know this...
I was against you from the start.

455
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,198
<i>(phone rings)</i>

456
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:20,078
That's very disappointing.

457
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:26,353
Hello. Ah, yes. Hello, Melinda.

458
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:29,955
Uh, yes. I'm just with Tom right now.
He's just finishing the briefing.

459
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,793
I understand.
I will let Mr Lennox know right away.

460
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,110
OK. Thanks.

461
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,395
The president asked for Lennox. Let's move.

462
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,550
I'm almost done.

463
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,238
Finished.

464
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,071
- It's armed.
- OK.

465
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:23,355
Now, this is the detonator.

466
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:27,035
Press "6-2-4-enter"
and a signal will activate the bomb.

467
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:29,315
OK. "6-2-4-enter".

468
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:33,871
Yeah. Once the signal's been sent, it'll take
15 seconds for the chemicals to intermix.

469
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:38,556
The kill radius is only ten feet.
Make sure Palmer is inside it.

470
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,913
Are you sure you can do it?

471
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,994
I'm the only one who can get close enough
to that podium without attracting attention.

472
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:49,640
I can do this.

473
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:55,068
All right, everyone. Rehearsal's up in
five minutes. Please notify the president.

474
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,270
Can we have some water for the podium?

475
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:19,749
- Sure.
- Thank you.

476
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,988
Before we continue, I would
just like to express my appreciation.

477
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:50,200
- You're taking a great risk, Mr President.
- You and I both share in that risk, sir.

478
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:53,795
And maybe that, in and of itself,
is something of a victory.

479
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,713
I just hope that
someone will listen to our appeal.

480
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,598
You sound sceptical.

481
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:04,470
The people we're trying to reach abandoned
the political process a long time ago.

482
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:08,951
All we need to do is create a foundation...
to build on.

483
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,031
The rest will follow.

484
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,794
- Reed.
- Mr President.

485
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:19,668
This is Hamri Al-Assad.
Mr Pollock is our deputy chief of staff.

486
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:22,320
- How do you do?
- Hello, sir.

487
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,790
If you want to get comfortable
behind the podium, I need to speak to Reed.

488
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:28,075
Of course.

489
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,638
<i>- (man) Mr Al-Assad.
- Yes.</i>

490
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:34,474
Would you like to review
the Teleprompter copy before you rehearse?

491
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,313
I've been trying to reach Tom
for the past hour.

492
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:41,473
- Is there something I should know?
- Something you should know, Mr President?

493
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:46,111
Reed, I know how Tom feels
about this address,

494
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:49,556
but I was under the impression
that he put his opposition aside

495
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:52,313
and was working with me
to make this policy succeed.

496
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,039
I'm sure that that's a valid impression,
Mr President.

497
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:59,796
- Then he'll be here.
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir. He will be here.

498
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,677
Good.

499
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,238
<i>(hissing)</i>

500
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,191
<i>(loud rumbling)</i>

501
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:01,872
You try that again and I'll kill you.
You understand? I should kill you, anyway.

502
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:08,115
With the president dead, nobody's gonna
think why his chief of staff hanged himself.

503
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:20,556
- Here we go for a rehearsal.
- I'm going to check on Tom, Mr President.

504
00:39:56,040 --> 00:40:01,160
I'll give you a seven-second countdown.
The last four seconds will be silent.

505
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:10,991
All right. Here we go in seven, six, five...

506
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,717
What is this?

507
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,031
Bomb!

508
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:25,154
<i>(alarm/shouting)</i>

509
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:27,913
Sir. Excuse me. Stand back.

510
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,911
<i>(agent) Spread out. Find him!</i>

511
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,789
- Got him!
- The president's been found!

512
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:13,509
Code five in sector three.
Citadel has been hit. Send a medical team.

513
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:16,433
I repeat: citadel is down.
Send medical team now.

514
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:00,311
