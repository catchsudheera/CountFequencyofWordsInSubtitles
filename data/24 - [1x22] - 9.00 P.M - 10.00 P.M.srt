1
00:00:12,536 --> 00:00:17,855
Right now, terrorists are plotting
to assassinate a presidential candidate.

2
00:00:17,935 --> 00:00:20,334
My wife and daughter have been targeted.

3
00:00:20,414 --> 00:00:24,534
And people that I work with
may be involved in both.

4
00:00:24,614 --> 00:00:30,093
I'm Federal Agent Jack Bauer,
and today is the longest day of my life.

5
00:00:33,852 --> 00:00:35,892
This is our night.

6
00:00:35,972 --> 00:00:40,651
Once you're in the White House,
everything defers to the office.

7
00:00:40,731 --> 00:00:43,770
It's what you need to do the job.

8
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:47,570
If it's your marriage
that helps you, that's great.

9
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:53,369
But if not, that's OK too.
You can have whatever you want, David.

10
00:00:54,609 --> 00:00:56,928
We gotta get outta here. Which way?

11
00:00:57,008 --> 00:01:01,687
I'm in an underground detention facility.
It's being used as a prison to house Drazen.

12
00:01:01,767 --> 00:01:04,527
You said you took him out two years ago.

13
00:01:05,887 --> 00:01:08,686
- Take cover!
- Let my father go, Bauer.

14
00:01:09,246 --> 00:01:10,726
The weapon's up.

15
00:01:10,806 --> 00:01:15,045
When does your suffering end? After
you've killed all your thousands of enemies?

16
00:01:15,125 --> 00:01:17,125
Yes.

17
00:01:18,125 --> 00:01:20,924
I will offer you one consolation.

18
00:01:21,004 --> 00:01:23,724
Your family will be joining you soon.

19
00:01:23,804 --> 00:01:26,163
Your son Alexis -
do you wanna see him again?

20
00:01:26,243 --> 00:01:28,803
We captured him and I know where he is.

21
00:01:29,763 --> 00:01:31,443
Get him in.

22
00:01:34,002 --> 00:01:35,042
I'm releasing you.

23
00:01:35,122 --> 00:01:38,561
- Did my dad call?
- No, but I talked to the people he works with.

24
00:01:38,641 --> 00:01:41,881
- Have you spoken to my mom?
- Yeah. She's waiting for you at CTU.

25
00:01:41,961 --> 00:01:43,601
- Are you serious?
- I'm serious.

26
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,720
- How did you end up in jail?
- I'll tell you everything when I get there.

27
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,159
No! No! No!

28
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,078
Help me! No!

29
00:02:03,717 --> 00:02:07,117
No! No! No! No!

30
00:02:07,717 --> 00:02:11,276
No! No!

31
00:03:17,545 --> 00:03:21,664
And now I'm proud to present
the future president of the United States:

32
00:03:21,744 --> 00:03:23,744
Senator David Palmer.

33
00:03:32,383 --> 00:03:34,382
Congratulations, Senator.

34
00:03:34,862 --> 00:03:36,862
Hey, we did it.

35
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,580
You know, this is our victory,

36
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:51,859
and when we started out
they said the country wasn't ready.

37
00:03:51,939 --> 00:03:54,819
They said it couldn't be done,
that it would never happen.

38
00:03:54,899 --> 00:03:58,458
Well, here we are, still standing tall.

39
00:04:01,618 --> 00:04:06,857
And when we look back at this amazing time
we can all say that we were a part of history.

40
00:04:07,657 --> 00:04:11,376
We can all say that we did our part
to make this world a better place,

41
00:04:11,456 --> 00:04:15,935
and, God willing, our children and our
children's children will reap the benefits

42
00:04:16,015 --> 00:04:18,615
of the seeds we sow right now.

43
00:04:38,852 --> 00:04:40,851
- CTU. Myers.
- Nina, it's me.

44
00:04:40,931 --> 00:04:44,651
- Jack, where are you?
- I'm with Andre and Victor Drazen.

45
00:04:44,731 --> 00:04:48,730
- What do you mean? Where?
- Nina, just listen. I'm being held hostage.

46
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:53,729
The reason why I'm calling is Victor wants
confirmation that his son Alexis is still alive.

47
00:04:53,809 --> 00:04:56,929
He's in the hospital.
I can try to get through to his room.

48
00:04:57,009 --> 00:04:59,608
- OK, do it.
- OK. Hold on.

49
00:04:59,688 --> 00:05:03,328
Tony, get me the hospital.
I need Alexis Drazen on line two.

50
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:11,166
I spoke to the backup team.
Drazen escaped. I want a net over the area.

51
00:05:11,246 --> 00:05:13,726
I want one, three and
five-mile mobile barriers.

52
00:05:13,806 --> 00:05:16,725
We know. We've got Jack on the line.
He's with Victor Drazen.

53
00:05:16,805 --> 00:05:19,205
- What?
- Nina, I've got Alexis Drazen.

54
00:05:19,285 --> 00:05:21,045
Transfer it.

55
00:05:22,764 --> 00:05:25,364
- Who... who is this?
- Hold on.

56
00:05:27,644 --> 00:05:29,763
Alexie?

57
00:05:29,843 --> 00:05:31,643
Father.

58
00:05:31,723 --> 00:05:34,482
Where... where are you? Did you get out?

59
00:05:35,042 --> 00:05:38,362
Alexie, what happened?
What have they done to you?

60
00:05:39,482 --> 00:05:42,481
You... you always said that...

61
00:05:43,401 --> 00:05:45,801
I would get in trouble with women.

62
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,720
You were right.

63
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,119
Forgive me, Father. I failed you.

64
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:56,959
You have not failed. You are alive. I am free.

65
00:05:58,398 --> 00:06:00,638
Free.

66
00:06:00,718 --> 00:06:02,718
Hold on, Alexie.

67
00:06:03,918 --> 00:06:06,157
We will be together soon.

68
00:06:06,237 --> 00:06:07,877
No, Papa.

69
00:06:07,957 --> 00:06:11,836
You go without me. I'm not going to make it.

70
00:06:11,916 --> 00:06:15,676
You will make it. Be strong.
Tell me you can do this.

71
00:06:15,756 --> 00:06:18,035
Yeah, Papa.

72
00:06:18,115 --> 00:06:20,635
I have something to say to the rest of you.

73
00:06:21,955 --> 00:06:26,754
I am willing to trade the life
of Jack Bauer for that of my son.

74
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:30,273
Mr. Drazen, this is George Mason again.

75
00:06:30,353 --> 00:06:33,713
I'm acting head of the CTU. I don't
have the authority to make the trade.

76
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:36,632
If you do not have the authority,
you are not head of anything.

77
00:06:36,712 --> 00:06:40,911
Talk to your superiors.
We will call back in 15 minutes.

78
00:06:40,991 --> 00:06:43,751
Be ready to respond without qualification.

79
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:53,429
And let me remind you that when
I was ten points behind in the polls,

80
00:06:53,509 --> 00:06:58,269
I told you I had a plan that
on this date we were gonna celebrate,

81
00:06:58,349 --> 00:07:00,428
party nomination in hand.

82
00:07:00,508 --> 00:07:02,628
Well, promise delivered.

83
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:12,786
- Hi.
- Hi.

84
00:07:12,866 --> 00:07:16,826
I'm not gonna be able to go
to Dallas with David tomorrow.

85
00:07:17,865 --> 00:07:18,945
Why not?

86
00:07:19,025 --> 00:07:23,344
I committed to a National Youth
Service Day event here in LA.

87
00:07:23,424 --> 00:07:28,984
- That's OK. I can reschedule that.
- No, Patty, I don't want you to reschedule.

88
00:07:29,064 --> 00:07:34,903
David and I could use a couple of days apart.
But I don't want him to feel alone, OK?

89
00:07:35,902 --> 00:07:37,902
Whatever you want.

90
00:07:37,982 --> 00:07:40,982
...doing the right thing is the only thing to do.

91
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:49,140
- You talk to Chapelle?
- Yeah.

92
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:51,620
- No trade.
- What?

93
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,899
This whole Victor Drazen thing
is a big embarrassment for them.

94
00:07:54,979 --> 00:07:57,899
If they do a trade,
it's an admission that he's alive,

95
00:07:57,979 --> 00:08:02,778
that the DOD's kept him here secretly,
and that on top of that they let him escape.

96
00:08:02,858 --> 00:08:05,857
So they're just gonna sacrifice Jack?

97
00:08:07,777 --> 00:08:10,697
He's like all the rest of us. Expendable.

98
00:08:11,377 --> 00:08:13,576
Is that what you think?

99
00:08:13,656 --> 00:08:17,456
It doesn't matter what I think. I don't think
he walks on water the way you do,

100
00:08:17,536 --> 00:08:20,455
but I don't wanna see him
hung out to dry either.

101
00:08:20,535 --> 00:08:22,775
Nina, I tried.

102
00:08:22,855 --> 00:08:25,974
George, without the trade,
how are they gonna locate Drazen?

103
00:08:26,054 --> 00:08:30,653
I guess they won't try. They'll let him leave
the country and pick him up in Europe later.

104
00:08:30,733 --> 00:08:32,733
If we do the trade, we know where he is.

105
00:08:32,813 --> 00:08:36,532
Hey, you're preaching to the choir.
That's what I just said to Chapelle.

106
00:08:36,612 --> 00:08:39,812
They don't wanna draw
attention to the situation.

107
00:08:41,332 --> 00:08:43,731
End of story.

108
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:48,530
So that's it. We just go back
to work and let Jack die.

109
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,370
What can I say?

110
00:08:57,769 --> 00:08:59,769
Nothing.

111
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,965
Nina. Shouldn't Kim be here by now?

112
00:09:22,045 --> 00:09:25,844
Well, they just left the police station.
She should be here soon.

113
00:09:25,924 --> 00:09:30,723
- I never did hear what happened with her.
- She was arrested by mistake. Listen, Teri.

114
00:09:30,803 --> 00:09:36,323
- Kim's fine. That's not the problem.
- What do you mean? What's going on?

115
00:09:36,403 --> 00:09:40,562
It's confirmed. Jack's been captured.
He's being held hostage.

116
00:09:41,482 --> 00:09:44,001
We're doing all we can
to bring him back, but...

117
00:09:44,081 --> 00:09:46,081
Wait.

118
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,440
- What do they want?
- It's hard to say.

119
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,320
Well, tell me what you know.

120
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:59,719
This guy Drazen wants to trade Jack
for his son Alexis, who we have.

121
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,438
Well, then, he'll be OK, right?

122
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:05,238
No. The government won't make the trade.

123
00:10:06,878 --> 00:10:11,597
What do you mean, they won't make the
trade? How are they gonna get Jack back?

124
00:10:11,677 --> 00:10:14,396
They're not. Jack's on his own.

125
00:10:17,636 --> 00:10:19,635
I'm sorry.

126
00:10:38,952 --> 00:10:42,192
There can be no flaws
and it must be done soon.

127
00:10:42,272 --> 00:10:47,431
I don't care how much it costs or how many
men you need. We're out of here by midnight.

128
00:10:48,751 --> 00:10:51,150
Call me back. Let me know.

129
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:53,230
There.

130
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:58,909
- Victor.
- Ah, my good, good friend.

131
00:11:00,389 --> 00:11:03,348
I never thought I would see you again.

132
00:11:03,428 --> 00:11:05,748
- How is your family?
- Eager to see you.

133
00:11:05,828 --> 00:11:10,147
- Ah, soon. Is everything prepared?
- Yes. Please, come in.

134
00:11:10,227 --> 00:11:12,747
Victor, I would like you
to meet my daughter, Mila.

135
00:11:12,827 --> 00:11:14,826
- Mila, right.
- Hello.

136
00:11:14,906 --> 00:11:17,506
- How beautiful.
- Thank you.

137
00:11:17,586 --> 00:11:21,065
- Just like your mother.
- Yes, but she got my temper.

138
00:11:21,145 --> 00:11:24,305
Ah! No good. That is no good.

139
00:11:25,745 --> 00:11:28,504
We have fresh clothes for you,
whenever you're ready.

140
00:11:28,584 --> 00:11:31,184
To you and your family.

141
00:11:35,463 --> 00:11:39,022
- Would you like something to eat, Jack?
- No.

142
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:58,579
It makes no sense. How does letting a CTU
agent die help keep Drazen out of the news?

143
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:04,658
- Teri, I'm busy. Can Nina help you now?
- No. I'm talking to you right now.

144
00:12:06,138 --> 00:12:08,737
Yeah. I'll call you right back, all right?

145
00:12:11,017 --> 00:12:13,537
You are not gonna let my husband die.

146
00:12:13,617 --> 00:12:17,936
No one is gonna let Jack die. We just can't
go through with the trade right now.

147
00:12:18,016 --> 00:12:21,135
There's no difference.
Without your help he has no chance.

148
00:12:21,215 --> 00:12:24,895
With an ordinary agent, I'd agree.
Jack's got a Special Forces background.

149
00:12:24,975 --> 00:12:27,654
- I've seen him do the impossible.
- Stop patronising me.

150
00:12:27,734 --> 00:12:33,293
You've done it all night. Just tell me what
you are prepared to do to help my husband.

151
00:12:33,373 --> 00:12:35,853
Fine. I'll stop patronising you.

152
00:12:35,933 --> 00:12:39,172
I'll tell you exactly what I'll do.
I'm gonna call up Division.

153
00:12:39,252 --> 00:12:43,132
I'm gonna ask them to reconsider
one more time and they're gonna say no

154
00:12:43,212 --> 00:12:46,011
and that'll be the end of it.

155
00:12:48,051 --> 00:12:50,171
Anything else?

156
00:13:03,088 --> 00:13:06,208
Nina. I'm asking you,
someone who cares about Jack,

157
00:13:06,288 --> 00:13:08,368
we cannot just stand by and watch him die.

158
00:13:08,448 --> 00:13:10,967
I know. I agree. I'm doing something about it.

159
00:13:11,047 --> 00:13:14,247
What do you mean? What are you doing?

160
00:13:14,327 --> 00:13:18,606
I think there's someone who can help Jack.
It's not procedure, so I can't talk about it.

161
00:13:18,686 --> 00:13:21,485
You're just gonna have to trust me.

162
00:13:22,565 --> 00:13:24,765
- OK.
- OK.

163
00:13:36,683 --> 00:13:38,963
No, I can't take all the credit for the speech.

164
00:13:39,043 --> 00:13:44,202
Oh, Patty. See, this is the lady you should be
complimenting. We were talking about you.

165
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:47,001
- Oh, really?
- Yes. They loved the speech tonight.

166
00:13:47,081 --> 00:13:51,960
Now, among other things, Patty's the brain
trust behind most of my public addresses.

167
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:55,280
Excuse me, Senator. Nina Myers at CTU.

168
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,239
- OK?
- Would you excuse me? I have to take this.

169
00:13:59,359 --> 00:14:02,239
- This is David Palmer.
- Thank you for taking my call.

170
00:14:02,319 --> 00:14:03,878
What can I do for you?

171
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:06,798
- Jack's in trouble. He needs help.
- What kind of trouble?

172
00:14:06,878 --> 00:14:10,517
There's no time to catch up with everything.
Let me give you the headlines.

173
00:14:10,597 --> 00:14:12,157
Victor Drazen is alive.

174
00:14:12,237 --> 00:14:15,597
- Whoa, whoa. What do you mean, he's alive?
- That's all we know.

175
00:14:15,677 --> 00:14:20,236
He was being held prisoner by the US
government up until about an hour ago.

176
00:14:21,116 --> 00:14:23,635
OK. What happened an hour ago?

177
00:14:23,715 --> 00:14:28,034
He escaped and he's taken Jack hostage.
He's willing to trade Jack for his son.

178
00:14:28,114 --> 00:14:32,834
- What's DOD's response?
- They're refusing to get directly involved.

179
00:14:33,474 --> 00:14:36,153
- Who knows you contacted me?
- No one.

180
00:14:36,233 --> 00:14:38,993
- All right. Who's talking to Drazen?
- George Mason.

181
00:14:39,073 --> 00:14:41,632
- Tell me about him.
- Normally he's by the book.

182
00:14:41,712 --> 00:14:45,192
- But he's very ambitious and very political.
- OK.

183
00:14:45,272 --> 00:14:48,471
Look, I'm gonna make a few calls first.
Where can I reach Mason?

184
00:14:48,551 --> 00:14:51,391
Here at CTU. He's in Jack's office.

185
00:14:51,471 --> 00:14:54,070
- All right.
- Thank you, Senator.

186
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:59,109
Are you sure?

187
00:15:00,189 --> 00:15:02,189
OK.

188
00:15:07,068 --> 00:15:09,428
- Tony.
- What's up?

189
00:15:10,148 --> 00:15:14,027
Kim's car was hit.
Two cops are down and she was taken.

190
00:15:14,107 --> 00:15:16,466
- What?
- Yeah.

191
00:15:19,626 --> 00:15:22,505
Was there any communication?
Any witnesses?

192
00:15:22,585 --> 00:15:25,105
They're working it up now.

193
00:15:25,185 --> 00:15:27,785
All right. Let me know what you find out.

194
00:15:33,664 --> 00:15:36,863
Tony, I'm gonna need
to talk to you in a few minutes.

195
00:15:39,663 --> 00:15:41,662
- Tony?
- What?

196
00:15:42,782 --> 00:15:45,742
- You all right?
- No. We got a problem.

197
00:15:45,822 --> 00:15:48,461
Hey. Any word on Kim?

198
00:15:50,021 --> 00:15:53,980
- Uh, I was just about to check.
- Well, she should be here any minute, right?

199
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:56,060
Yeah.

200
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:01,419
Teri, I'm sorry. Do you mind
waiting in the conference room?

201
00:16:01,499 --> 00:16:03,499
- Sure.
- Thanks.

202
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:11,337
- What's going on?
- They grabbed Kim again.

203
00:16:11,417 --> 00:16:13,537
- What?
- It must have been Drazen.

204
00:16:13,617 --> 00:16:18,056
- The patrol car she was riding in was hit.
- I don't believe this.

205
00:16:20,096 --> 00:16:22,696
Are you gonna tell her?

206
00:16:41,173 --> 00:16:44,452
- Mason.
- I have Senator Palmer on the line.

207
00:16:44,532 --> 00:16:47,212
Oh, yeah. Put him through.

208
00:16:47,811 --> 00:16:48,651
Hello.

209
00:16:48,731 --> 00:16:52,131
Senator, this is George Mason.
It's an honour to speak to you, sir.

210
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:56,250
I want you to reverse your orders
on the Bauer-for-Drazen trade.

211
00:16:56,330 --> 00:17:01,289
Uh, I'm not sure how much information you
have about this, but this is agency business

212
00:17:01,369 --> 00:17:05,249
and, with all due respect,
it doesn't fall under the Senate's purview.

213
00:17:05,329 --> 00:17:09,768
As you well know, Mr. Mason, your entire
agency falls under presidential purview

214
00:17:09,848 --> 00:17:12,127
and in nine months I will be in that office.

215
00:17:12,207 --> 00:17:14,687
I'm not sure if that's meant
to tempt or threaten me.

216
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:19,526
It doesn't matter either way because I don't
have the authority to pull the trigger on this.

217
00:17:19,606 --> 00:17:23,566
From what I'm told, that authority
is something you'd like to have some day.

218
00:17:23,646 --> 00:17:25,805
What's that supposed to mean?

219
00:17:25,885 --> 00:17:29,125
Act on your own prerogative.
Go through with the trade.

220
00:17:29,205 --> 00:17:32,684
You'll be reprimanded,
possibly even demoted.

221
00:17:32,764 --> 00:17:35,204
So far it sounds great.

222
00:17:35,284 --> 00:17:39,603
In the first month of my term I'll instate you
in a high-level position in Washington.

223
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:42,282
You'll bypass five years
of middle management.

224
00:17:42,362 --> 00:17:44,682
And if you don't get elected?

225
00:17:44,762 --> 00:17:47,802
That's not gonna happen.
Think about it, George.

226
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:03,119
- Transportation has been arranged.
- Problems with last-minute changes?

227
00:18:03,199 --> 00:18:05,279
- It's going to cost more.
- How much?

228
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:07,358
200,000.

229
00:18:07,998 --> 00:18:10,598
You should try, Jack, the borek.

230
00:18:11,518 --> 00:18:14,597
- It is wonderful.
- Do you need anything else?

231
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:16,877
No. Everything is perfect.

232
00:18:17,637 --> 00:18:20,236
My father told me to take good care of you.

233
00:18:20,316 --> 00:18:25,155
The service was impeccable
and my compliments to the chef.

234
00:18:25,675 --> 00:18:28,115
Thank you. It was my mother's recipe.

235
00:18:33,914 --> 00:18:36,993
Drop the weapons! Drop the weapons!

236
00:18:38,313 --> 00:18:42,073
Put your weapons down!
Put your weapons down or I'll cut her throat!

237
00:18:42,153 --> 00:18:44,112
Drop the weapons!

238
00:18:46,112 --> 00:18:48,192
Put them down.

239
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:51,311
- You too, Victor.
- Of course.

240
00:18:52,271 --> 00:18:54,031
Drop the weapon!

241
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:01,189
You son of a bitch.

242
00:19:01,269 --> 00:19:04,989
- One more death for you to atone for, Jack.
- You son of a bitch!

243
00:19:05,069 --> 00:19:07,788
How could you do this?

244
00:19:08,348 --> 00:19:11,188
- What happened?
- Call CTU now.

245
00:19:11,268 --> 00:19:14,467
Tell them I want your brother
Alexis here now.

246
00:19:14,547 --> 00:19:18,867
Tie his hands behind his back.
And keep her father away from here.

247
00:19:18,947 --> 00:19:23,346
You're supposed to be watching him.
What am I paying you for?

248
00:19:36,624 --> 00:19:38,943
- Where's Teri?
- In the conference room.

249
00:19:42,103 --> 00:19:43,342
Mason.

250
00:19:43,422 --> 00:19:46,222
Mr. Mason. What have you decided?

251
00:19:48,902 --> 00:19:50,901
Mr. Mason?

252
00:19:52,141 --> 00:19:54,901
We're gonna do the swap on our terms.

253
00:19:54,981 --> 00:20:00,740
Yeah, that's an interesting dream. The swap
will take place exactly 30 minutes from now.

254
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:06,379
The address is 2127 Grand Avenue.
A green SUV will be waiting.

255
00:20:06,459 --> 00:20:09,858
- Place my brother inside the vehicle.
- What about Jack?

256
00:20:09,938 --> 00:20:13,378
When my brother's in position
I'll direct you to Bauer.

257
00:20:14,497 --> 00:20:17,377
You have 29 minutes.

258
00:20:17,457 --> 00:20:19,976
I got it. 2127 Grand Avenue.

259
00:20:20,656 --> 00:20:24,896
- It's a repair garage.
- Get ahold of Chris Porterfield at LAPD.

260
00:20:24,976 --> 00:20:28,095
Tell him we're taking over the streets
in that area for two hours.

261
00:20:28,175 --> 00:20:31,015
- Where are you going?
- The hospital, to get Alexis.

262
00:20:31,095 --> 00:20:33,774
He just got stabbed.
They're not gonna let him out.

263
00:20:33,854 --> 00:20:36,454
They're gonna have to.

264
00:20:40,253 --> 00:20:43,693
Oh, no, don't worry. My name's
not gonna be even close to this.

265
00:20:43,773 --> 00:20:46,212
This conversation has
to end between us two.

266
00:20:46,292 --> 00:20:48,332
- I agree.
- OK, then.

267
00:20:48,412 --> 00:20:50,811
- Look, I gotta get back.
- We're clear?

268
00:20:50,891 --> 00:20:52,891
Yeah.

269
00:21:03,569 --> 00:21:06,049
There you are. David, where have you been?

270
00:21:07,209 --> 00:21:08,888
I had to make some calls.

271
00:21:08,968 --> 00:21:11,048
Just in case you haven't noticed,

272
00:21:11,128 --> 00:21:15,047
everyone is here to see you. You need
to make an impression, not phone calls.

273
00:21:15,127 --> 00:21:17,607
- I know what I have to do, Sherry.
- Do you really?

274
00:21:17,687 --> 00:21:20,766
Don't talk down to me, Sherry. I don't like it.

275
00:21:20,846 --> 00:21:24,446
I hope the weakness you've shown today
is because you missed a night's sleep

276
00:21:24,526 --> 00:21:26,565
and you'll be back on your game tomorrow.

277
00:21:26,645 --> 00:21:31,445
Otherwise we will be buried
before this election even happens.

278
00:21:35,484 --> 00:21:38,204
Steven! No, stay. I'll be over.

279
00:21:38,284 --> 00:21:40,243
Get to work.

280
00:21:46,402 --> 00:21:50,082
Senator? The Wall Street Journal
had a couple of questions for you.

281
00:21:50,162 --> 00:21:53,841
I put together some past quotes
so you wouldn't have to bother with it.

282
00:21:53,921 --> 00:21:56,840
I... I hope that's all right.

283
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,920
Sure.

284
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,159
Well, don't you look gorgeous tonight?

285
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:06,719
- You've seen this before.
- It's not just the dress.

286
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:07,959
Thank you.

287
00:22:10,398 --> 00:22:15,237
Patty, I've been thinking. Since this incident
with Keith is out in the open,

288
00:22:15,317 --> 00:22:19,157
it's gonna shift the focus of every interview,
every press conference.

289
00:22:19,237 --> 00:22:23,716
Yeah. I've already started a Q and A of all the
questions to expect over the next few days.

290
00:22:23,796 --> 00:22:27,955
- Have you talked to Mike about this?
- Not yet. I need a little more time to prepare.

291
00:22:28,035 --> 00:22:31,715
- I'd like to see whatever you have so far.
- Sure. Whenever you want.

292
00:22:31,795 --> 00:22:33,794
How about now?

293
00:22:34,514 --> 00:22:36,274
- Now?
- Yeah.

294
00:22:36,354 --> 00:22:39,593
Everybody seems to be having
a good time. There's an open bar.

295
00:22:39,673 --> 00:22:43,393
- I doubt anyone will even notice I'm gone.
- I doubt that's true, Senator.

296
00:22:43,473 --> 00:22:47,552
In any event, I could use some quiet time.
Stay here. Tell me where your notes are.

297
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:52,591
If you don't mind, I'd rather walk you through
it. It would make more sense to you that way.

298
00:22:52,671 --> 00:22:57,390
OK. Why don't you meet me
upstairs in, say, five minutes?

299
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:59,470
Sure.

300
00:23:10,228 --> 00:23:11,628
Ah.

301
00:23:11,708 --> 00:23:13,708
My dear friend.

302
00:23:14,588 --> 00:23:18,227
It's not what you think.
I have lost my wife and daughter.

303
00:23:18,307 --> 00:23:23,226
You, both of your brothers and now Mila.
This is what our enemies have done to us.

304
00:23:23,306 --> 00:23:26,506
He would have killed her,
and not in a merciful way.

305
00:23:37,704 --> 00:23:42,983
How could you do this, murderer?

306
00:23:45,063 --> 00:23:47,662
You killed my daughter.

307
00:23:48,982 --> 00:23:51,622
You killed my daughter!

308
00:23:51,702 --> 00:23:54,101
You murderer! You...

309
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:02,100
- We have to get out of here.
- Kim!

310
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:04,579
Get him in the van.

311
00:24:12,338 --> 00:24:14,658
Get this place cleaned out.

312
00:24:37,654 --> 00:24:40,733
Nina. What's happening?
Are they gonna help Jack?

313
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:43,373
- Yes. They're gonna trade.
- That's good, isn't it?

314
00:24:43,453 --> 00:24:46,213
- What do you think? Will he be safe?
- I think so.

315
00:24:46,293 --> 00:24:49,612
Victor wants his son back,
so I don't think he'll pull anything.

316
00:24:49,692 --> 00:24:52,212
Oh, thank God.
And when's this gonna happen?

317
00:24:52,292 --> 00:24:55,771
10, 15 minutes.
Mason's already left to pick up Alexis.

318
00:24:55,851 --> 00:24:59,570
That's so good. I can hardly wait
for this whole thing to be over.

319
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:03,330
I think when Jack and Kim arrive,
I'll just have to collapse in a big heap.

320
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:05,809
- Do you need anything else?
- Um...

321
00:25:05,889 --> 00:25:09,409
Actually, there is one thing.
I know Kim's on her way over here

322
00:25:09,489 --> 00:25:12,168
but I'd feel better if I could
speak to her on the phone.

323
00:25:12,248 --> 00:25:15,368
Is there any way you could patch me
through to the police car?

324
00:25:15,448 --> 00:25:19,967
We were so busy tracking Jack, I didn't
have a chance to check on them. Um...

325
00:25:20,047 --> 00:25:24,086
- Yeah, let me see if that's possible.
- Thank you. Nina.

326
00:25:25,366 --> 00:25:29,165
I know it's been a really long day for you too,
and I guess I want you to know

327
00:25:29,245 --> 00:25:33,445
how much I appreciate your being
up front with me about everything.

328
00:25:37,004 --> 00:25:38,884
Sure.

329
00:25:53,801 --> 00:25:56,401
I couldn't tell her.

330
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:04,400
I just couldn't
after everything she's been through.

331
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,479
I understand.

332
00:26:16,478 --> 00:26:18,037
You OK?

333
00:26:18,117 --> 00:26:20,117
I just...

334
00:26:20,197 --> 00:26:23,277
I just feel like I'm not doing my job.

335
00:26:23,357 --> 00:26:27,116
Look, there's nothing wrong with
the way you're doing your job, OK?

336
00:26:27,196 --> 00:26:30,755
I mean, ultimately, we're here
to try to help people, right?

337
00:26:30,835 --> 00:26:33,955
I don't know anybody
who does that better than you.

338
00:26:36,874 --> 00:26:38,874
Thanks.

339
00:26:41,074 --> 00:26:43,073
You're welcome.

340
00:26:53,232 --> 00:26:57,031
You gotta let my daughter go.
She's got nothing to do with this.

341
00:26:57,111 --> 00:27:00,990
You want me to do something for you,
I'll do it, but let my daughter go. I'm not...

342
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:06,629
After what you have done, I should kill you
and your daughter right now. Don't test me.

343
00:27:08,789 --> 00:27:11,309
You're not thinking this through, Andre.

344
00:27:11,389 --> 00:27:14,548
You have a chance to get out
with your brother and father alive.

345
00:27:14,628 --> 00:27:18,028
- You kill innocents, they'll never let you...
- Enough!

346
00:27:18,108 --> 00:27:23,067
Your best tactic right now, Mr. Bauer,
is to be quiet and let my father rest.

347
00:27:25,466 --> 00:27:26,346
OK.

348
00:27:38,184 --> 00:27:41,664
All I care about with Ferragamo
is that the public knows,

349
00:27:41,744 --> 00:27:45,903
in no uncertain terms, that Carl and the
Latham Group acted outside our influence.

350
00:27:45,983 --> 00:27:51,102
No, they will. Mike's already started setting
up interviews with all the major papers.

351
00:27:51,182 --> 00:27:53,302
He's clearing up points with your attorney.

352
00:27:53,382 --> 00:27:57,101
By the morning you should be able
to speak freely and get the word out.

353
00:27:57,181 --> 00:28:01,660
- When did you have time to do all this?
- In the last couple of hours.

354
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:06,300
You wrote two speeches for me today.

355
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:09,979
If I don't help you get into the White House,
I'm out of a job.

356
00:28:13,578 --> 00:28:16,498
- Would you care for a glass of champagne?
- Sure.

357
00:28:20,097 --> 00:28:23,537
- When do you find time for a life?
- Well, this is my life.

358
00:28:24,217 --> 00:28:27,496
Oh, no, no, no. I mean a boyfriend. Friends.

359
00:28:27,576 --> 00:28:30,296
Ah. I know. I should get out more.

360
00:28:30,376 --> 00:28:32,375
Yeah, you should.

361
00:28:34,055 --> 00:28:35,975
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

362
00:28:36,055 --> 00:28:38,014
You're welcome.

363
00:28:39,854 --> 00:28:41,334
Cheers.

364
00:28:41,414 --> 00:28:43,973
Mm. What are we drinking to?

365
00:28:44,653 --> 00:28:46,933
To taking five minutes off, starting now.

366
00:28:47,013 --> 00:28:50,092
- Mm, well. Hear, hear.
- Hear, hear.

367
00:28:57,251 --> 00:29:01,450
So, um, you and Sherry
were childhood sweethearts?

368
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:05,090
That's right.

369
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:09,449
And there's never been anyone else?

370
00:29:09,529 --> 00:29:12,969
I'm running for president, Patty.
I can't answer that.

371
00:29:14,288 --> 00:29:16,328
Come on.

372
00:29:21,527 --> 00:29:24,687
Are you flirting with me, Patty?

373
00:29:24,767 --> 00:29:27,566
I don't know. I think I might be.

374
00:29:31,845 --> 00:29:37,565
This is good. Tell Mike I wanna meet
with him on this first thing in the morning.

375
00:29:37,645 --> 00:29:41,444
I want you there. Call Everly.
Someone from legal should be there too.

376
00:29:41,524 --> 00:29:43,524
- Done.
- And...

377
00:29:44,323 --> 00:29:48,083
it wouldn't hurt to put in
a little more face time downstairs.

378
00:29:48,163 --> 00:29:50,842
I think you might be right.

379
00:29:50,922 --> 00:29:52,882
- Shall we?
- Yes.

380
00:30:28,756 --> 00:30:30,756
Wait here, Father.

381
00:30:47,033 --> 00:30:50,473
If your people deliver my brother
as promised, you'll live.

382
00:30:50,552 --> 00:30:52,712
If not, then you'll die here.

383
00:30:55,832 --> 00:30:58,911
There are sniper rifles
currently aiming at you.

384
00:30:58,991 --> 00:31:02,311
- They await my instructions.
- What about my daughter?

385
00:31:02,391 --> 00:31:06,630
You'll hear from us when this is over -
if you make it that far -

386
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:10,709
and to dissuade you from wasting
valuable time trying to trace,

387
00:31:10,789 --> 00:31:13,109
I prepared a scrambled phone.

388
00:31:14,189 --> 00:31:16,788
What do you want me to do?

389
00:31:17,588 --> 00:31:19,588
Not yet.

390
00:31:24,467 --> 00:31:26,986
What do you want me to do?!

391
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:08,940
- Oh, Senator.
- Hey, John. Thanks for coming.

392
00:32:09,819 --> 00:32:13,939
Hey, Michael. Thanks for coming.
Look at you. Don't you look nice?

393
00:32:14,739 --> 00:32:16,138
- Sir.
- Hey, how are you?

394
00:32:16,218 --> 00:32:18,218
Senator.

395
00:32:20,498 --> 00:32:22,497
There you are. I'd like for you to meet

396
00:32:22,577 --> 00:32:26,697
Doctors Bryan Chasin
and Darrell Maines from UCLA.

397
00:32:26,777 --> 00:32:31,256
Yes, of course. You're the gentlemen doing
such wonderful work in AIDS research.

398
00:32:31,336 --> 00:32:33,655
Sweetheart, I need to look after something.

399
00:32:33,735 --> 00:32:35,735
- Uh-huh.
- Excuse me.

400
00:32:37,295 --> 00:32:41,974
So, what isn't the government doing
for you that we could fix next term?

401
00:32:55,092 --> 00:32:57,012
Patty?

402
00:32:57,092 --> 00:33:00,411
- Hi.
- You were upstairs with David, weren't you?

403
00:33:02,451 --> 00:33:04,450
Yes.

404
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:07,450
Good. What happened?

405
00:33:09,010 --> 00:33:11,809
- I did what you told me.
- And?

406
00:33:12,569 --> 00:33:17,888
I think it's working. Mrs. Palmer,
I'm not sure where all of this is going.

407
00:33:18,928 --> 00:33:24,127
All you need to know is that this is for his
own good and for the good of his campaign.

408
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:31,086
What's the problem? I thought you liked
David. This shouldn't be a tough assignment.

409
00:33:31,166 --> 00:33:33,846
I do like him.

410
00:33:33,926 --> 00:33:36,885
It's just hard for me to deceive him like this.

411
00:33:41,444 --> 00:33:44,324
I understand your hesitation.

412
00:33:44,404 --> 00:33:50,243
But I know my husband better than anybody
and he needs someone like you right now.

413
00:33:51,843 --> 00:33:55,242
But it's gonna lead
to other things, Mrs. Palmer.

414
00:33:55,322 --> 00:33:58,841
Well, we'll just deal with that
when the time comes.

415
00:33:58,921 --> 00:34:00,921
Oh, cherries. Mm.

416
00:34:02,201 --> 00:34:04,201
Thanks.

417
00:34:48,073 --> 00:34:49,833
Everyone in position.

418
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:15,629
OK, we're here. Stay outside the perimeter.
Let's just get in and get out.

419
00:35:22,908 --> 00:35:26,707
- Here's Alexis. Where's Jack?
- What's wrong with him?

420
00:35:26,787 --> 00:35:30,066
- Nothing. He'll be fine.
- Alexis, are you all right?

421
00:35:37,945 --> 00:35:39,985
- Yes.
- Alexis is hurt.

422
00:35:40,065 --> 00:35:41,784
- How badly?
- Worse than we thought.

423
00:35:41,864 --> 00:35:43,744
He's fine.

424
00:35:43,824 --> 00:35:47,464
- We need a doctor.
- I'll have one there when you arrive. Go.

425
00:35:50,463 --> 00:35:53,902
- What are we doing here?
- Once we're satisfied you're not following us,

426
00:35:53,982 --> 00:35:58,782
- we'll give you Jack's location.
- That's unacceptable. We need to know now.

427
00:36:00,661 --> 00:36:03,261
Hold it right there.

428
00:36:03,341 --> 00:36:06,140
Move to second position. We have a problem.

429
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:14,059
Are you going to shoot me?

430
00:36:14,139 --> 00:36:18,298
You should have taken more English lessons.
"Trade" means we get something too.

431
00:36:18,378 --> 00:36:21,378
I want Jack now
or you're all coming back with us.

432
00:36:24,098 --> 00:36:27,217
We have Jack's daughter.
You must know that by now.

433
00:36:28,417 --> 00:36:30,776
What are you saying?
We get Jack and Kimberly?

434
00:36:30,856 --> 00:36:35,696
My English is clear. You're going
to get back Jack, as discussed.

435
00:36:36,415 --> 00:36:39,415
- What about the daughter?
- That's not my concern.

436
00:36:41,815 --> 00:36:44,934
I need to talk to Drazen.

437
00:36:45,014 --> 00:36:48,254
If you keep holding me here,
I can't return Alexis to his father.

438
00:36:48,334 --> 00:36:50,933
We are on a schedule, remember?

439
00:36:58,812 --> 00:37:03,051
All right. Move back to the perimeter.
We're gonna have to let 'em go.

440
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:13,009
We'll be waiting to hear from you.

441
00:37:23,688 --> 00:37:27,247
- Nina, do you copy?
- Yeah, I have 'em.

442
00:37:29,647 --> 00:37:32,566
Soon as we get Jack we'll take them down.

443
00:37:32,646 --> 00:37:35,246
OK. We're standing by.

444
00:38:34,516 --> 00:38:36,556
Dammit.

445
00:38:36,636 --> 00:38:39,995
- What's wrong?
- They found the tracker. We lost 'em.

446
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:14,829
- Yeah.
- South of the platform there's a car.

447
00:39:14,909 --> 00:39:19,629
If you want to see Kim alive, talk to no one,
get into it, head towards Century City.

448
00:39:19,709 --> 00:39:21,708
Wait, wait.
