1
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:16,646
What we're doing here is very simple.

2
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:20,690
We're going to release a certain substance
so it flows into your pipelines.

3
00:00:20,851 --> 00:00:24,322
Take the canisters
to the main distribution tank, quickly.

4
00:00:24,652 --> 00:00:26,165
Is Wayne Palmer dead yet?

5
00:00:26,253 --> 00:00:28,403
- No.
- Explain.

6
00:00:28,492 --> 00:00:31,007
We rolled his car,
but he survived and got away.

7
00:00:31,093 --> 00:00:35,485
<i>- It was sloppy. We'll make it right.
- You better. You know what's at stake.</i>

8
00:00:35,574 --> 00:00:37,485
Get down!

9
00:00:46,056 --> 00:00:49,970
It's the truth. Audrey Raines was my contact
at the Department of Defense.

10
00:00:50,057 --> 00:00:52,207
- You met with her face to face?
- Yes.

11
00:00:52,298 --> 00:00:56,133
- Dammit, Audrey! Tell me the truth!
- I am telling you the truth!

12
00:00:56,218 --> 00:01:01,577
You already lied. Tell me what you know, or
I promise this will become very unpleasant.

13
00:01:01,899 --> 00:01:04,619
Bill, we have a connection.

14
00:01:04,699 --> 00:01:08,455
Henderson made calls to Collette.
That voids her agreement.

15
00:01:09,221 --> 00:01:12,453
You have three seconds to tell me
where the target is, or I will kill you.

16
00:01:12,541 --> 00:01:14,772
Where is the target?!

17
00:01:14,862 --> 00:01:17,456
A natural gas distribution centre.

18
00:01:17,543 --> 00:01:23,175
Once the Sentox hits the main tank and goes
right into the pipes, it's impossible to stop.

19
00:01:23,263 --> 00:01:25,095
From there, it goes to people's homes.

20
00:01:29,264 --> 00:01:30,778
The Sentox is in the system.

21
00:01:30,865 --> 00:01:34,495
- I need C4 and a timer. Get these people out.
- What are you doing?

22
00:01:34,586 --> 00:01:37,225
To deliver the Sentox,
it had to mix with natural gas.

23
00:01:37,307 --> 00:01:42,256
If we can ignite that gas before it leaves
the plant, the Sentox will be incinerated.

24
00:01:48,269 --> 00:01:50,224
Bierko!

25
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:59,544
- That's it. The main tanks are going. Get out!
Jack, are you clear?

26
00:02:01,511 --> 00:02:03,230
<i>Jack, respond.</i>

27
00:02:16,554 --> 00:02:19,865
Curtis. Curtis, this is Audrey.
Any sign of Jack?

28
00:02:19,955 --> 00:02:23,187
<i>Nothing.
I've got men searching the main tank area.</i>

29
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:26,473
Rescue units have arrived.
They're assessing the situation.

30
00:02:26,556 --> 00:02:29,867
Chloe, what are we getting
from the air monitors?

31
00:02:29,957 --> 00:02:32,346
- Come on, Jack.
- Chloe.

32
00:02:33,197 --> 00:02:36,235
Trace readings of the nerve agent,
below danger levels.

33
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:39,914
It looks like the Sentox was incinerated.
Jack's plan worked.

34
00:02:39,999 --> 00:02:45,472
I'm going to brief the White House.
Apprise me of any developments. Miles.

35
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,118
<i>Curtis,
have we searched the area for Jack?</i>

36
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,319
<i>It's under way.
He hasn't gone out the north exit.</i>

37
00:03:08,965 --> 00:03:11,798
CTU, Jack's OK.
Get a medical team over here now.

38
00:03:11,885 --> 00:03:15,161
Jack! Are you OK?

39
00:03:15,246 --> 00:03:17,077
Give me a hand.

40
00:03:18,006 --> 00:03:19,998
I got him.

41
00:03:21,767 --> 00:03:23,247
Bierko!

42
00:03:23,447 --> 00:03:24,676
Bierko!

43
00:03:25,488 --> 00:03:27,319
Bierko!

44
00:03:28,488 --> 00:03:31,481
- I need him conscious.
- Yes, sir.

45
00:03:31,569 --> 00:03:35,199
- The nerve gas, did it leave the plant?
- There's no trace. It worked.

46
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:38,248
- Good.
- He's in shock. We need to transport him.

47
00:03:38,331 --> 00:03:41,243
- I want him taken back to CTU Medical.
- Yes, sir.

48
00:03:41,331 --> 00:03:45,040
Curtis, organise an escort team.
You get him back to CTU alive.

49
00:03:45,132 --> 00:03:47,282
You got it.

50
00:03:48,372 --> 00:03:50,761
On my count. Three, two, one.

51
00:03:50,852 --> 00:03:54,403
Team A, meet me by the staging area.
We need an escort to CTU.

52
00:03:57,094 --> 00:04:00,883
- Buchanan.
- Bill, it's Jack. Is your line still secure?

53
00:04:00,975 --> 00:04:04,048
<i>- Yes.
- What's your status on Henderson?</i>

54
00:04:04,136 --> 00:04:07,685
<i>- He's still an active protocol.
- You need to make him a priority.</i>

55
00:04:07,776 --> 00:04:10,688
Bill, listen to me. I know Henderson.

56
00:04:10,777 --> 00:04:14,292
He couldn't have planned this.
He's a soldier and a patriot.

57
00:04:14,378 --> 00:04:17,495
However misguided,
he believes what he's doing is right.

58
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:21,652
He was willing to let his wife die
in order to protect someone very powerful.

59
00:04:21,739 --> 00:04:24,300
<i>- Who?
- I don't know.</i>

60
00:04:24,379 --> 00:04:26,416
Bill, I'm scared.

61
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:31,334
I think this is bigger than anything
we could ever have imagined.

62
00:04:31,421 --> 00:04:35,176
Karen, you're not hearing me.
They managed to prevent an attack.

63
00:04:35,262 --> 00:04:39,620
It doesn't negate the fact CTU's performance
has been one misstep after another.

64
00:04:39,702 --> 00:04:43,013
<i>I'm not disputing that,
Mr. Vice President.</i>

65
00:04:43,103 --> 00:04:46,892
Then why hesitate to carry out your mandate?
Have Homeland absorb CTU.

66
00:04:46,984 --> 00:04:50,056
CTU is still actively looking
for Christopher Henderson.

67
00:04:50,144 --> 00:04:52,340
A shake-up right now could hamper that.

68
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:55,657
I won't hold up this takeover
because of a procedural mop-up.

69
00:04:55,745 --> 00:04:59,182
- Henderson will be caught. Understood?
- Clearly.

70
00:04:59,267 --> 00:05:02,703
Whatever hoops you have to jump through,
just get it done.

71
00:05:02,787 --> 00:05:05,699
<i>- Yes, sir.
- Keep me informed.</i>

72
00:05:05,787 --> 00:05:10,259
- I guess we should get started.
- Buchanan is not gonna take this lying down.

73
00:05:10,349 --> 00:05:13,659
Despite what the vice president said,
CTU saved a lot of lives.

74
00:05:13,749 --> 00:05:19,108
If Buchanan mounts a challenge, it will be
seen in that light. This could be reversed.

75
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:25,142
If we were to find someone who would go
on record citing Buchanan's mismanagement,

76
00:05:25,231 --> 00:05:30,182
how he superseded Lynn McGill's authority,
how he allowed CTU to be compromised,

77
00:05:30,273 --> 00:05:33,390
it'd go a long way
to mitigating his successes.

78
00:05:33,473 --> 00:05:37,752
- It'd give us the protection we need.
- Buchanan's people are extremely loyal.

79
00:05:37,834 --> 00:05:41,110
I'm not thinking about a member of CTU.

80
00:05:42,315 --> 00:05:46,866
I'm thinking of Audrey Raines. She was here
all morning. She saw what went on.

81
00:05:46,956 --> 00:05:50,108
And her loyalty is split
between CTU and DOD.

82
00:05:50,196 --> 00:05:52,313
We could take advantage of that.

83
00:05:52,396 --> 00:05:56,107
Let me draft a statement and present it to her.

84
00:05:56,677 --> 00:06:01,230
We're being rolled up, Audrey.
Homeland's taking over.

85
00:06:01,318 --> 00:06:03,879
That's impossible.

86
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:06,348
Karen told me herself.

87
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:12,312
No, they can't do that.
Not after what you've accomplished today.

88
00:06:12,401 --> 00:06:15,393
I'd like to think we've earned a reprieve,
but I doubt it.

89
00:06:15,481 --> 00:06:18,519
CTU is in the middle of an investigation.

90
00:06:18,602 --> 00:06:20,638
Henderson is still at large.

91
00:06:20,723 --> 00:06:23,442
I know, it doesn't make any sense.

92
00:06:25,123 --> 00:06:28,912
Karen's taking orders from the vice president.
He wants this to happen.

93
00:06:29,004 --> 00:06:33,078
- Why?
- I've been asking myself the same question.

94
00:06:38,526 --> 00:06:41,041
<i>- We lost him.
- How did you lose him?</i>

95
00:06:41,126 --> 00:06:43,482
Palmer knocked Cobb out
and took his weapon.

96
00:06:43,567 --> 00:06:46,526
We tried to pursue,
but someone came to Palmer's aid.

97
00:06:46,607 --> 00:06:49,168
- Who?
- That's unclear.

98
00:06:49,248 --> 00:06:51,205
They got away.

99
00:06:51,288 --> 00:06:55,168
All right. We're going to our fall-back.
Scrub the scene and get over here.

100
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:57,206
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

101
00:07:17,414 --> 00:07:19,769
You're all right, Mr. Palmer.

102
00:07:19,854 --> 00:07:22,812
- Just take it slow.
- Aaron.

103
00:07:22,895 --> 00:07:27,571
We're at the presidential retreat.
Can you try to sit up?

104
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:36,252
- I think we need to get you looked at, sir.
- There isn't enough time for that. I'm all right.

105
00:07:36,697 --> 00:07:39,611
Then maybe you can explain to me
what's going on.

106
00:07:39,698 --> 00:07:42,736
Why were those men trying to kill you?

107
00:07:43,779 --> 00:07:46,499
Because David had a source
inside the White House.

108
00:07:46,579 --> 00:07:49,333
Someone was trying
to prevent me from seeing her.

109
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:51,615
Who's this source?

110
00:07:51,701 --> 00:07:54,261
Mrs. Logan's assistant.

111
00:07:54,341 --> 00:07:57,061
- Evelyn Martin?
- Yeah.

112
00:07:57,141 --> 00:08:02,296
She and David were trading emails. I need
to find out the content of those messages.

113
00:08:02,383 --> 00:08:07,742
I think David was killed
because of information Evelyn gave him.

114
00:08:13,304 --> 00:08:17,538
I drafted a letter to the families
of the victims of the Sunrise Hills Mall.

115
00:08:17,626 --> 00:08:19,935
- It's here for your review.
- Thank you.

116
00:08:20,026 --> 00:08:23,178
Your schedule's there.
You have a 9am with the press office

117
00:08:23,267 --> 00:08:25,781
and the president
wants you in on his briefing.

118
00:08:25,867 --> 00:08:29,417
Evelyn, are you all right?

119
00:08:29,508 --> 00:08:31,977
I'm fine. I'm just tired.

120
00:08:32,069 --> 00:08:34,424
It's been a long day.

121
00:08:34,509 --> 00:08:37,467
I'm surprised any of us got through it.

122
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:42,066
Oh, do you have your credentials with you?
There's still a curfew in place.

123
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:44,142
I have them with me.

124
00:08:44,231 --> 00:08:46,347
Good. Try to get some rest.

125
00:08:46,431 --> 00:08:48,821
- Good night.
- Good night.

126
00:08:58,033 --> 00:09:00,025
Evelyn.

127
00:09:00,114 --> 00:09:01,467
Hi.

128
00:09:01,914 --> 00:09:05,669
- I really need to talk to you.
- I'm sorry, Mr. Palmer. I need to go home.

129
00:09:05,755 --> 00:09:08,350
Ma'am, please.

130
00:09:09,556 --> 00:09:11,627
This won't take but a second.

131
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,229
You were sending emails to my brother.

132
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,400
- Why?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

133
00:09:34,481 --> 00:09:40,478
I traced the IP account right to your address,
so, yes, you do know what I'm talking about.

134
00:09:42,122 --> 00:09:44,717
I need to know what you told David.

135
00:09:45,403 --> 00:09:49,363
- I didn't tell him anything.
- Evelyn.

136
00:09:49,444 --> 00:09:51,674
I have the record of your correspondence.

137
00:09:51,765 --> 00:09:55,917
David deleted the content of the messages,
but I know, Evelyn.

138
00:09:56,005 --> 00:10:01,478
I know you were in contact with him,
so please don't lie to me again.

139
00:10:02,847 --> 00:10:05,441
Tell me what I need to know.

140
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:09,725
Someone killed David. They killed him.

141
00:10:09,808 --> 00:10:12,003
And then just tried to kill me.

142
00:10:12,088 --> 00:10:14,682
Now, I think they knew
I was coming here to see you,

143
00:10:14,769 --> 00:10:17,044
so I think that means we're both in danger.

144
00:10:17,129 --> 00:10:20,725
- Please, I have to go now.
- Give me what I need! Talk to me!

145
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:22,801
I can't!

146
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:26,564
They kidnapped my little girl.

147
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:30,931
They kidnapped my little girl.

148
00:10:31,012 --> 00:10:33,402
They kidnapped my baby.

149
00:10:35,653 --> 00:10:40,364
They said they would give Amy back to me
if I gave them the evidence.

150
00:10:40,454 --> 00:10:42,524
What evidence?

151
00:10:43,774 --> 00:10:48,531
I have proof about who's behind
everything that's happened today.

152
00:10:49,975 --> 00:10:52,809
They're gonna kill my baby.
They're gonna kill...

153
00:10:52,896 --> 00:10:55,969
Listen to me. Listen.
Even if you turn over this evidence,

154
00:10:56,057 --> 00:11:01,496
they're not just gonna give you back your
daughter. That's not what these people do.

155
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:05,127
Now, you've gotta trust me, Evelyn.
Please, talk to me.

156
00:11:06,859 --> 00:11:08,850
Ma'am, if I may.

157
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:14,099
Mr. Palmer's right. You know too much.

158
00:11:14,181 --> 00:11:16,775
They'll kill you both.

159
00:11:24,422 --> 00:11:30,181
I'll give you the evidence that I have
if you get me back my daughter.

160
00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:46,807
I got Henderson's work records
for the past ten years. There's a lot.

161
00:11:46,899 --> 00:11:52,657
I'll start data mining, see if there's anything
we can use to track him down.

162
00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:59,818
That's Chloe O'Brian.

163
00:11:59,901 --> 00:12:02,622
That's Jim Hill from Homeland.

164
00:12:02,702 --> 00:12:06,412
I'm Jim Hill, Homeland Security.
Could you show me your station?

165
00:12:06,503 --> 00:12:08,574
- Chloe O'Brian?
- Yeah?

166
00:12:08,664 --> 00:12:11,622
I'm taking over your station.
I need your access codes.

167
00:12:11,704 --> 00:12:17,063
- Who are you? What's going on here?
May I have your attention, please?

168
00:12:17,145 --> 00:12:20,183
These men and women
are from Homeland Security.

169
00:12:20,266 --> 00:12:24,306
I've just authorised
a unitwide backslash protocol.

170
00:12:24,387 --> 00:12:29,018
CTU is being absorbed
by the Department of Homeland Security.

171
00:12:29,827 --> 00:12:32,901
Ladies and gentlemen,
I realise this is sudden,

172
00:12:32,988 --> 00:12:35,867
and this has been a very difficult day,

173
00:12:35,949 --> 00:12:39,579
but let's cooperate
to make this transition as smooth as possible.

174
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:41,786
There is still work to be done.

175
00:12:41,871 --> 00:12:44,065
Vladimir Bierko is en route to CTU,

176
00:12:44,151 --> 00:12:47,382
and Christopher Henderson
remains an open protocol.

177
00:12:47,472 --> 00:12:49,463
Thank you.

178
00:12:53,953 --> 00:12:57,913
Ms Raines, would you mind joining me
in the situation room?

179
00:12:57,993 --> 00:13:00,872
- Why?
- We need to speak in private.

180
00:13:01,314 --> 00:13:02,906
Fine.

181
00:13:13,316 --> 00:13:16,115
<i>- This is Bauer.
- Jack, it's Wayne Palmer.</i>

182
00:13:16,557 --> 00:13:19,277
Are you all right?
I just heard about the explosion.

183
00:13:19,357 --> 00:13:25,308
I'm fine, but I wish the people responsible for
your brother's assassination were in custody.

184
00:13:25,398 --> 00:13:28,710
- Yeah, well, maybe I can help you with that.
- How?

185
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:33,113
I'm at President Logan's retreat.
I'm with Evelyn Martin, Mrs. Logan's assistant.

186
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:39,071
- What does she have to do with this?
- She has proof other people were involved.

187
00:13:39,162 --> 00:13:41,153
- Who?
- She won't tell me.

188
00:13:41,242 --> 00:13:43,756
<i>Why not?</i>

189
00:13:43,843 --> 00:13:45,640
Her daughter's been kidnapped.

190
00:13:46,123 --> 00:13:49,082
They'll kill her
unless Evelyn hands over the evidence.

191
00:13:49,163 --> 00:13:52,395
- This has to be Henderson.
- They'll call with a place to meet.

192
00:13:52,484 --> 00:13:56,478
I wanna be on that call when it comes.
CTU will provide operational support.

193
00:13:56,565 --> 00:13:59,284
We're gonna need a place to meet.

194
00:13:59,366 --> 00:14:03,279
I passed an old barn about a mile west
of the retreat, off service road 19.

195
00:14:03,367 --> 00:14:06,200
Service road 19. I'll be there in 20 minutes.

196
00:14:06,287 --> 00:14:08,084
See you then.

197
00:14:08,168 --> 00:14:10,398
Jack's gonna meet us. We should go.

198
00:14:10,488 --> 00:14:14,687
Listen, they may be watching you,
so I don't think we should leave together.

199
00:14:14,768 --> 00:14:17,489
- What do you want to do?
- We'll separate.

200
00:14:17,569 --> 00:14:21,848
- Get to your car. We'll meet in the parking lot.
- OK.

201
00:14:26,931 --> 00:14:29,240
See you soon.

202
00:14:31,732 --> 00:14:35,851
"The acting director's failure
to enhance security, in the light of the threat,

203
00:14:35,933 --> 00:14:40,724
effectively invited the subsequent attack
that resulted in loss of personnel"?

204
00:14:40,814 --> 00:14:43,249
You can't possibly expect me to sign this.

205
00:14:43,334 --> 00:14:47,453
It's a complete distortion, designed
to place blame on Bill Buchanan and CTU.

206
00:14:47,535 --> 00:14:52,815
But you agree that today's attacks represent
a serious failure that needs to be addressed?

207
00:14:52,897 --> 00:14:56,810
Thanks to CTU, hundreds of thousands
of people are alive who would be dead.

208
00:14:56,897 --> 00:15:02,336
But if CTU had been operating effectively,
those people would never have been at risk.

209
00:15:02,418 --> 00:15:06,570
I couldn't more strongly disagree
with this statement.

210
00:15:06,659 --> 00:15:09,220
Well, I'm disappointed with your decision,

211
00:15:09,299 --> 00:15:11,734
but I appreciate your loyalty.

212
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,288
Of course.

213
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:19,330
Oh, just to confirm,
as on-site liaison for DOD,

214
00:15:19,421 --> 00:15:22,892
you participated
in today's decision-making process.

215
00:15:23,343 --> 00:15:26,540
- What's your point?
- Serious mistakes were made here today

216
00:15:26,623 --> 00:15:29,900
that resulted in the loss of American lives.

217
00:15:29,983 --> 00:15:36,254
It would be a shame to see the taint of CTU's
mismanagement spread to your agency.

218
00:15:37,265 --> 00:15:40,258
And your career.

219
00:15:40,346 --> 00:15:45,740
By signing this,
you isolate the fallout for today's mistakes

220
00:15:45,827 --> 00:15:49,024
to Bill Buchanan and CTU -

221
00:15:49,467 --> 00:15:51,618
where it belongs.

222
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:08,466
I'm proud of what we did here today.

223
00:16:08,911 --> 00:16:11,789
The people of CTU are heroes,

224
00:16:11,872 --> 00:16:14,670
especially Bill Buchanan.

225
00:16:14,752 --> 00:16:18,507
This takeover is completely unwarranted,

226
00:16:18,593 --> 00:16:21,153
and I won't help you justify it.

227
00:16:29,675 --> 00:16:31,075
<i>- Hello.
- It's Jack.</i>

228
00:16:31,155 --> 00:16:34,546
- Jack, where are you?
- I'm on my way to see Wayne Palmer.

229
00:16:34,636 --> 00:16:35,671
Wayne Palmer?

230
00:16:35,757 --> 00:16:38,635
Wayne told me
the aide to the first lady has evidence

231
00:16:38,717 --> 00:16:41,834
that proves who's behind
David Palmer's assassination.

232
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:46,197
She won't give it to Wayne because her
daughter's been kidnapped to keep her quiet.

233
00:16:46,278 --> 00:16:51,070
- They want to trade the evidence for the girl.
- Oh, my God, Jack.

234
00:16:51,159 --> 00:16:54,709
I'm gonna need you to retask a satellite
to those coordinates.

235
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,756
<i>- That could be difficult.
- Why?</i>

236
00:16:56,841 --> 00:17:01,551
CTU is being rolled up. Karen is replacing
everyone with people from Homeland.

237
00:17:01,642 --> 00:17:03,951
- What? That doesn't make sense.
- I know.

238
00:17:04,042 --> 00:17:07,160
Even if she has a reason to,
we're tracking down Henderson.

239
00:17:07,242 --> 00:17:09,393
We'll never bring her team up to speed.

240
00:17:09,483 --> 00:17:14,512
I know that she's taking orders
from Vice President Gardner himself.

241
00:17:14,605 --> 00:17:17,198
- Maybe you should talk to Karen directly.
- No.

242
00:17:17,285 --> 00:17:18,684
She's the one in control.

243
00:17:18,765 --> 00:17:23,282
When I was interrogating Henderson,
he was protecting someone very powerful.

244
00:17:23,366 --> 00:17:25,960
He'd have let his wife die
rather than give him up.

245
00:17:26,046 --> 00:17:28,959
And now Vice President Gardner
is shutting down CTU

246
00:17:29,047 --> 00:17:33,644
when we're actually in a position
to bring Henderson in.

247
00:17:33,728 --> 00:17:35,923
Do you really think Gardner's involved?

248
00:17:36,009 --> 00:17:39,639
We can't afford
to take the chance that he's not.

249
00:17:39,729 --> 00:17:43,769
- All right, what do you want me to do?
- Get Chloe to retask the satellite.

250
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:47,081
Chloe has been let go,
along with the rest of her department.

251
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:50,402
I need the satellite.
Figure out a way to get Chloe back on.

252
00:17:50,491 --> 00:17:53,131
All right, all right. I'll call you back.

253
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:03,929
I could approach senior CTU staff.
- That's a waste of time.

254
00:18:04,014 --> 00:18:08,087
They're worried about their jobs.
We could promise them some security.

255
00:18:08,175 --> 00:18:10,405
Excuse me.

256
00:18:11,335 --> 00:18:13,486
I've reconsidered my position.

257
00:18:16,216 --> 00:18:18,605
I'll sign your statement.

258
00:18:18,696 --> 00:18:21,575
May I ask why the sudden change of heart?

259
00:18:22,137 --> 00:18:24,606
I don't agree with everything in the statement,

260
00:18:24,698 --> 00:18:27,849
but I see the need to shield DOD
of any possible controversy

261
00:18:27,939 --> 00:18:30,772
that could reflect back on my father.

262
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,697
Miles.

263
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:40,016
Thank you.

264
00:18:40,101 --> 00:18:43,776
- I want one thing in return.
- What's that?

265
00:18:43,862 --> 00:18:47,775
- That Chloe be kept on and assigned to me.
- Why Chloe?

266
00:18:47,863 --> 00:18:52,221
I'm gonna need considerable server access
to compile my report for DOD.

267
00:18:52,303 --> 00:18:56,422
- Chloe can help me finish it in half the time.
- Other people can do that job.

268
00:18:56,504 --> 00:18:58,894
I have a working relationship with Chloe.

269
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:06,055
She's an asset that you cannot afford to lose.

270
00:19:06,667 --> 00:19:08,783
Do we have a deal?

271
00:19:14,548 --> 00:19:16,698
Yes.

272
00:19:16,788 --> 00:19:18,780
Good.

273
00:19:22,629 --> 00:19:26,783
Evelyn Martin will leave
the presidential retreat in a couple of minutes.

274
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:30,659
- It's time to get going.
- What about the girl?

275
00:19:32,992 --> 00:19:35,301
I'll take care of her.

276
00:19:55,396 --> 00:19:59,469
<i>- Wayne Palmer.
- I'm at my car. No one's around.</i>

277
00:19:59,557 --> 00:20:02,072
<i>- I'm on my way.
- OK.</i>

278
00:20:04,197 --> 00:20:08,238
I'm extremely uncomfortable
sending the two of you off without protection.

279
00:20:08,318 --> 00:20:12,676
We've been over this. If you leave the
compound again, we risk raising suspicion.

280
00:20:12,759 --> 00:20:15,957
I know it, sir, but I don't like it.

281
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,952
Wayne.

282
00:20:18,681 --> 00:20:20,797
Well, this is a surprise.

283
00:20:20,881 --> 00:20:23,271
We didn't know you were coming.

284
00:20:23,362 --> 00:20:26,752
Are you here to see the president?

285
00:20:26,842 --> 00:20:28,434
No.

286
00:20:30,363 --> 00:20:36,041
Mr. Palmer came here to give me a memento
from his brother. It's a service medal.

287
00:20:36,124 --> 00:20:40,596
Sorry, I just knew you and the president
were gonna be dealing with this crisis today

288
00:20:40,685 --> 00:20:45,362
and I just... I didn't want you people
to feel obliged to see me.

289
00:20:45,446 --> 00:20:50,566
It would never ever be any obligation on
our part, especially under the circumstances.

290
00:20:50,647 --> 00:20:53,957
I just want you to know how sorry I am.

291
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:59,765
Your brother was one of the greatest men
to ever occupy the office.

292
00:20:59,849 --> 00:21:03,319
His loss, to all of us,

293
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:07,081
can't be expressed in words.

294
00:21:08,891 --> 00:21:10,290
Thank you.

295
00:21:10,371 --> 00:21:14,888
I know the president would also like
to express his condolences to you personally.

296
00:21:14,971 --> 00:21:18,521
That means a lot, sir,
but unfortunately I have a plane to catch.

297
00:21:18,612 --> 00:21:20,843
I'm...

298
00:21:20,933 --> 00:21:23,652
flying David's body back to Washington, so...

299
00:21:23,734 --> 00:21:25,964
Oh, I understand.

300
00:21:28,054 --> 00:21:30,091
Safe trip.

301
00:21:30,175 --> 00:21:33,565
- Thank you, sir.
- I'll walk you out, sir.

302
00:21:39,617 --> 00:21:41,608
Excuse me.

303
00:21:46,778 --> 00:21:48,770
Mr. Buchanan.

304
00:21:51,179 --> 00:21:54,138
Ms O'Brian, we're not done here.

305
00:21:55,059 --> 00:21:59,576
- How can they get away with this?
- This is not over. Just follow instructions.

306
00:21:59,661 --> 00:22:03,813
- Everyone's getting fired.
- I'll do everything I can to get that rescinded.

307
00:22:03,902 --> 00:22:06,462
Once what we accomplished today
is made public,

308
00:22:06,542 --> 00:22:09,010
I am confident we'll be back at our posts.

309
00:22:09,102 --> 00:22:13,938
The best thing you can do is stay focused and
follow your orders. Do you understand me?

310
00:22:14,023 --> 00:22:15,935
- Yes, sir.
- It's gonna be all right.

311
00:22:16,023 --> 00:22:19,381
O'Brian, don't transfer your station to Valerie.
You got a pass.

312
00:22:19,464 --> 00:22:22,981
- I did?
- Yeah. So get back to work.

313
00:22:23,065 --> 00:22:25,295
I don't understand. Why am I staying?

314
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:29,426
Because Ms Raines requested
that you keep your position.

315
00:22:29,506 --> 00:22:32,658
What does Audrey Raines
have to do with this?

316
00:22:32,747 --> 00:22:39,267
Ms Raines signed a statement documenting
the numerous missteps made today by CTU...

317
00:22:40,629 --> 00:22:42,540
and by you in particular.

318
00:22:42,629 --> 00:22:46,543
So, for the moment, she gets what she wants,
and she wants O'Brian.

319
00:22:46,629 --> 00:22:49,906
Audrey would never sign anything like that.

320
00:22:49,991 --> 00:22:52,459
I did sign it, Bill.

321
00:22:53,391 --> 00:22:55,222
Why?

322
00:22:56,111 --> 00:22:57,943
Because it's the truth.

323
00:22:58,032 --> 00:23:02,231
You realise this effectively kills
any chance we have of rescinding that order?

324
00:23:02,313 --> 00:23:05,067
Yes, I know.

325
00:23:05,153 --> 00:23:07,065
I'm sorry.

326
00:23:10,595 --> 00:23:12,586
O'Brian.

327
00:23:19,876 --> 00:23:24,155
I got a call from a man about an hour ago
who told me that he had my daughter,

328
00:23:24,237 --> 00:23:28,072
and if I ever wanted to see her alive,
I'd have to follow his instructions.

329
00:23:28,158 --> 00:23:32,072
- Did he give you proof he had her?
- I talked to her. She sounded so scared.

330
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,514
Did you tell anybody else about this?

331
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:38,036
I couldn't.
He said that if I did, he would know.

332
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:42,880
We have a deal. I'll do everything I can
to get your daughter back, but...

333
00:23:42,961 --> 00:23:48,480
No, I told you before. I can't tell you anything
until I have Amy back.

334
00:23:48,562 --> 00:23:51,202
You called David with this information.
Why him?

335
00:23:51,283 --> 00:23:53,160
I knew him.

336
00:23:53,243 --> 00:23:55,996
He and the first lady were friends.

337
00:23:56,083 --> 00:23:58,803
He was truly a wonderful man.

338
00:24:02,845 --> 00:24:04,643
Yes.

339
00:24:06,166 --> 00:24:08,236
Yes, he was.

340
00:24:10,807 --> 00:24:16,360
I still can't accept talking about him
in the past tense. It just...

341
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:21,042
I just can't believe he's gone.

342
00:24:21,129 --> 00:24:24,405
I told him this information
because I trusted him.

343
00:24:24,489 --> 00:24:28,608
I never thought for a moment
that it would endanger him.

344
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:33,365
I have your brother's blood on my hands
and I will never forgive myself.

345
00:24:33,451 --> 00:24:35,204
Evelyn...

346
00:24:35,291 --> 00:24:38,010
you did nothing wrong.

347
00:24:40,212 --> 00:24:42,773
It's them.

348
00:24:45,134 --> 00:24:47,011
Bauer.

349
00:24:47,093 --> 00:24:51,885
- Jack, the call's coming through.
- Patch me in.

350
00:24:54,255 --> 00:24:56,723
Are you ready for this?

351
00:25:00,256 --> 00:25:03,806
- Hello.
- What took you so long to answer, Evelyn?

352
00:25:03,897 --> 00:25:06,287
I was passing through security. I just left.

353
00:25:06,378 --> 00:25:08,369
- Are you alone?
- Yes.

354
00:25:08,458 --> 00:25:12,974
- Why was Wayne Palmer at the retreat?
- Wayne Palmer?

355
00:25:13,059 --> 00:25:17,850
Please don't waste my time. He was there
for a reason. It wasn't to drop off his résumé.

356
00:25:17,939 --> 00:25:22,013
- I think he was there to speak with you.
- I didn't even know he was there.

357
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,774
<i>- I don't believe you.
- I didn't see him.</i>

358
00:25:24,861 --> 00:25:28,013
If you're lying to me,
it is your daughter who will suffer.

359
00:25:28,101 --> 00:25:31,492
<i>I'm telling you the truth.
Please, you have to believe me.</i>

360
00:25:31,582 --> 00:25:33,938
Did you bring what we discussed?

361
00:25:34,023 --> 00:25:35,536
Yes.

362
00:25:35,624 --> 00:25:38,696
Please, let me talk to Amy.

363
00:25:38,784 --> 00:25:40,776
Very well.

364
00:25:43,585 --> 00:25:46,736
All right, sweetheart.
This is your mommy. Say hello.

365
00:25:46,826 --> 00:25:49,056
- Mommy?
- It's me, honey. Are you OK?

366
00:25:49,146 --> 00:25:51,944
Uh-huh. Are you coming to get me now?

367
00:25:52,027 --> 00:25:54,666
Mommy's gonna be there real soon.

368
00:25:55,707 --> 00:25:58,939
I want you to keep being brave, OK?

369
00:25:59,028 --> 00:26:02,145
<i>- You promise me?
- I promise.</i>

370
00:26:02,229 --> 00:26:04,504
I love you, my baby.

371
00:26:04,949 --> 00:26:09,705
- I love you too.
- OK, that's enough, sweetheart. Very good.

372
00:26:10,751 --> 00:26:16,349
<i>Now take down this address.
4615 Tarpin Street.</i>

373
00:26:16,951 --> 00:26:20,262
<i>- Got it?
- Yes. I've got it.</i>

374
00:26:24,233 --> 00:26:26,987
<i>- Hello.
- Audrey, it's Jack. I just got off the call.</i>

375
00:26:27,074 --> 00:26:30,783
<i>It was Henderson.
Have you got Chloe back online?</i>

376
00:26:30,874 --> 00:26:34,151
<i>- Audrey?
- Sorry, Jack. Yes, Chloe's still here.</i>

377
00:26:34,235 --> 00:26:37,750
- I'll give you the address for the satellite.
- All right. Go ahead.

378
00:26:37,836 --> 00:26:40,748
4615 Tarpin.

379
00:26:40,836 --> 00:26:43,749
All right. Give me a few minutes.

380
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:54,353
- Chloe, come with me.
- Don't talk to me.

381
00:26:54,439 --> 00:26:56,077
- It's for Jack.
- Jack?

382
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:59,391
Chloe, Jack needs your help.

383
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,118
Please.

384
00:27:03,001 --> 00:27:04,593
Fine.

385
00:27:06,081 --> 00:27:09,358
- What's going on?
- I had to keep Karen from replacing you.

386
00:27:09,442 --> 00:27:11,910
That's why I signed. I didn't have a choice.

387
00:27:12,002 --> 00:27:15,632
- I don't understand.
- You're the only one Jack and I trust here.

388
00:27:15,723 --> 00:27:18,158
Jack needs one of the satellites retasked.

389
00:27:18,244 --> 00:27:22,032
- Why?
- Here's the address. We need a full sweep.

390
00:27:22,124 --> 00:27:27,153
- I'm gonna need an explanation.
- I will give you one, but we need to hurry.

391
00:28:17,655 --> 00:28:20,045
Something's wrong.

392
00:28:27,457 --> 00:28:28,811
Wayne.

393
00:28:28,898 --> 00:28:31,173
Jack.

394
00:28:31,658 --> 00:28:34,934
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. It's good to see you.

395
00:28:35,019 --> 00:28:37,579
Good to see you too.

396
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:44,816
Evelyn, my name is Jack Bauer.

397
00:28:44,901 --> 00:28:48,018
I promise you
we're gonna get your daughter back.

398
00:28:48,102 --> 00:28:51,378
But right now I need to know what you know.

399
00:28:51,462 --> 00:28:57,413
I already told them I wouldn't give up
any information until I have my daughter.

400
00:28:59,503 --> 00:29:01,415
Fine.

401
00:29:01,504 --> 00:29:04,144
Excuse me for one second.

402
00:29:13,187 --> 00:29:15,621
<i>- Audrey Raines.
- Let me speak to Chloe.</i>

403
00:29:15,707 --> 00:29:18,426
OK, Jack. Hold on.

404
00:29:18,507 --> 00:29:21,068
- You're on speaker.
- Jack, Audrey told me.

405
00:29:21,148 --> 00:29:25,984
<i>- I can't believe the vice president's involved.
- I know. Where are we with the satellite?</i>

406
00:29:26,069 --> 00:29:29,062
It's coming up now.

407
00:29:29,149 --> 00:29:33,268
I'm sending the image to your PDA.
There are men all over the place.

408
00:29:33,351 --> 00:29:35,865
- How many?
- I'm counting ten.

409
00:29:36,871 --> 00:29:42,026
OK, I want you to keep the satellite on target
and download real-time images to my PDA.

410
00:29:42,112 --> 00:29:44,910
<i>- OK.
Jack.</i>

411
00:29:45,633 --> 00:29:47,908
I'll go with Evelyn to make the exchange.

412
00:29:47,993 --> 00:29:51,066
Find somewhere safe
and stay there until this is over.

413
00:29:51,154 --> 00:29:54,704
- I'm going with you.
- I can't allow that. This will be dangerous.

414
00:29:54,794 --> 00:29:57,025
- I was a marine, Jack.
- I know that, Wayne.

415
00:29:57,115 --> 00:29:59,265
And you never saw combat.

416
00:29:59,355 --> 00:30:04,875
There is a big difference between training
to kill someone and actually having to do it.

417
00:30:04,956 --> 00:30:11,147
I can't put you in harm's way, out of respect
to your brother. Your family needs you now.

418
00:30:13,038 --> 00:30:16,748
These are the people
who killed my brother, Jack.

419
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:24,071
They shot a bullet right through his neck,

420
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:26,196
and then he died in my arms.

421
00:30:29,722 --> 00:30:32,714
Put yourself in my position.

422
00:30:32,802 --> 00:30:35,271
Could you just walk away?

423
00:30:36,843 --> 00:30:38,674
No.

424
00:30:38,763 --> 00:30:41,198
Neither can I.

425
00:30:41,284 --> 00:30:44,082
I'm coming with you, Jack.

426
00:30:48,645 --> 00:30:52,525
Thank you for your support,
Mr. Prime Minister.

427
00:30:54,447 --> 00:30:58,565
Give my regards to your lovely wife.
We'll talk soon.

428
00:30:59,488 --> 00:31:03,925
- It'll take me a day to return these calls.
- That's wonderful, Mr. President.

429
00:31:04,008 --> 00:31:09,003
World leaders, prominent Americans - they're
all lining up to offer their congratulations.

430
00:31:09,089 --> 00:31:13,606
Sir, were you aware
that Wayne Palmer was on the premises?

431
00:31:14,611 --> 00:31:17,250
- He was?
- Yes, I just spoke with him a half-hour ago.

432
00:31:17,331 --> 00:31:19,527
He just left. You didn't speak with him?

433
00:31:19,611 --> 00:31:21,442
No.

434
00:31:21,532 --> 00:31:23,649
What was he doing here?

435
00:31:23,732 --> 00:31:28,727
He said he had a memento from President
Palmer to give to Aaron Pierce - a medal.

436
00:31:28,813 --> 00:31:32,807
That explains it.
David and Aaron were very close.

437
00:31:33,854 --> 00:31:38,087
I'm just surprised
he didn't want to speak with you.

438
00:31:38,175 --> 00:31:43,409
It's no secret that his brother and I had
our share of disagreements over the years.

439
00:31:43,496 --> 00:31:47,934
It's possible Wayne harbours
ill feelings towards me.

440
00:31:48,017 --> 00:31:50,486
That must be the reason.

441
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:05,970
- Are you clear on the plan?
- I don't think I can do this.

442
00:32:06,061 --> 00:32:08,416
Do you want to see your little girl again?

443
00:32:08,501 --> 00:32:13,530
These men didn't hesitate to kill Palmer and
won't hesitate to kill you and your daughter.

444
00:32:13,622 --> 00:32:15,772
Right now I am your last chance.

445
00:32:16,703 --> 00:32:20,094
We have to stick to the plan.
Do you understand me?

446
00:32:20,184 --> 00:32:24,258
- Once you have your daughter in your arms...
- I know what to do.

447
00:32:25,424 --> 00:32:28,144
We are going to get her back.

448
00:32:30,705 --> 00:32:33,015
Let's go.

449
00:32:46,988 --> 00:32:49,742
Call out, "Testing, one, two, three. "

450
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:53,186
- Testing, one, two, three.
- Chloe, did you get that?

451
00:32:53,269 --> 00:32:56,148
You're coming through.
I'm refreshing your screen.

452
00:32:56,231 --> 00:32:59,780
OK, we're at the southeast corner entrance.

453
00:32:59,871 --> 00:33:06,392
There's a tunnel through that door that leads
to a conveyor belt to the middle of the plant.

454
00:33:06,913 --> 00:33:09,302
Be careful. There's a hostile at the exit.

455
00:33:09,393 --> 00:33:11,349
Copy that.

456
00:33:13,754 --> 00:33:16,348
Draw your weapon.

457
00:33:17,395 --> 00:33:19,386
Let's go.

458
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:48,314
Bravo, check,
have you got a visual on the mark?

459
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:51,678
Negative, sir. All units holding.

460
00:33:51,761 --> 00:33:53,559
Copy.

461
00:33:59,083 --> 00:34:01,075
This way.

462
00:34:28,529 --> 00:34:30,520
Let's go.

463
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:39,529
There's too many of them.
We're running out of time.

464
00:34:39,611 --> 00:34:44,811
I need you to take out a guard so I can
climb this structure and take out the sniper.

465
00:34:44,892 --> 00:34:48,647
It's about 100 yards north of here
on the other side. Can you do that?

466
00:34:48,733 --> 00:34:51,645
- Yeah. I can do it.
- Wait!

467
00:34:51,733 --> 00:34:54,487
One of them's moving.

468
00:35:00,895 --> 00:35:02,328
Go.

469
00:35:14,898 --> 00:35:17,571
<i>- Mr. Palmer, can you hear me?
- Copy.</i>

470
00:35:17,658 --> 00:35:19,934
I'm south of the lower belt, moving west.

471
00:35:20,019 --> 00:35:22,249
Continue to the end. Your target's north.

472
00:35:49,065 --> 00:35:50,817
Jack, it's all clear.

473
00:36:21,111 --> 00:36:23,501
This is Bravo.

474
00:36:23,591 --> 00:36:25,867
I think I hear a car.

475
00:36:26,952 --> 00:36:31,822
Vehicle headed north.
Single occupant, female. Over.

476
00:36:38,475 --> 00:36:40,989
<i>Bravo, what have you got?</i>

477
00:36:43,036 --> 00:36:45,914
<i>I repeat, Bravo, what have you got?</i>

478
00:36:47,356 --> 00:36:49,427
<i>Bravo, come in.</i>

479
00:36:49,516 --> 00:36:52,475
<i>Woman is alone in the car.</i>

480
00:36:53,478 --> 00:36:55,469
Say again. I didn't get that.

481
00:36:55,557 --> 00:36:58,948
I repeat, woman is alone in the car.

482
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:03,795
Copy.

483
00:37:19,442 --> 00:37:22,003
We've taken out four men.
Evelyn is in position.

484
00:37:22,083 --> 00:37:24,802
- Wayne, I want you to wait for my signal.
- Copy.

485
00:37:24,884 --> 00:37:28,194
<i>We need Henderson alive.
Do not shoot to kill.</i>

486
00:37:31,525 --> 00:37:34,882
- Yes.
- Open all the doors and the trunk of the car.

487
00:37:48,848 --> 00:37:55,608
Very good, Evelyn. Now go to the front
of the car and drop the keys on the ground.

488
00:37:56,049 --> 00:38:00,010
I have the evidence with me.
I want my daughter.

489
00:38:02,451 --> 00:38:05,125
Bravo, hold your position. I'm coming out.

490
00:38:11,012 --> 00:38:13,811
I have a visual on Henderson and the girl.

491
00:38:18,134 --> 00:38:20,126
OK, Evelyn. Give me the evidence.

492
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:24,255
I'll give you the evidence
once you give me Amy.

493
00:38:24,335 --> 00:38:26,008
Come on. Let her go.

494
00:38:27,056 --> 00:38:29,047
OK, honey. Go see Mommy.

495
00:38:29,136 --> 00:38:31,367
- Mommy!
- She's moving.

496
00:38:33,218 --> 00:38:36,290
Give me the evidence, Evelyn.

497
00:38:36,778 --> 00:38:39,531
Get down. Get down.

498
00:38:39,619 --> 00:38:43,134
Bravo, check, come in.
Bravo. Come in, Bravo.

499
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:59,693
Wayne, I didn't get him.
If you've got a shot, take it.

500
00:39:16,706 --> 00:39:20,142
Henderson escaped in Evelyn's car.
Do you have him on satellite?

501
00:39:20,227 --> 00:39:24,539
We saw, but he's leaving the grid. We're
scanning the plant, not the neighbourhood.

502
00:39:24,628 --> 00:39:27,347
Well, then reprogram it. We can't lose him.

503
00:39:28,348 --> 00:39:31,340
- Is she all right?
- Evelyn's been hit.

504
00:39:47,991 --> 00:39:50,666
The bullet passed through.
It hasn't hit an artery.

505
00:39:50,752 --> 00:39:53,108
It's not serious, but it needs to be dressed.

506
00:39:53,193 --> 00:39:55,946
You got your daughter,
now tell me what I need to know.

507
00:39:56,034 --> 00:39:59,265
Who is behind this? Is it the vice president?

508
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:04,031
- Evelyn, is it the vice president?
- He has nothing to do with this.

509
00:40:07,636 --> 00:40:10,070
<i>You promised me
you would control this.</i>

510
00:40:10,156 --> 00:40:14,594
I didn't count on Jack Bauer showing up, sir.
He outmanoeuvred me.

511
00:40:14,677 --> 00:40:19,274
Sir, Bauer and Palmer won't be around long
enough to tell anybody else what they know.

512
00:40:19,358 --> 00:40:23,432
I'm putting together another team.
I will handle this, sir, I promise you.

513
00:40:23,879 --> 00:40:26,474
<i>I will not let you down.</i>

514
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,389
See that you don't.
