1
00:00:14,807 --> 00:00:17,115
Jack Bauer's undercover with the terrorists.

2
00:00:17,206 --> 00:00:21,357
They're expecting Jack to help them release
a canister of Sentox nerve gas

3
00:00:21,446 --> 00:00:23,436
in the Sunrise Hills shopping mall.

4
00:00:23,525 --> 00:00:27,677
Do you mean actually let them release
the Sentox? Are you out of your mind?

5
00:00:27,765 --> 00:00:31,804
<i> We're monitoring them. 
We're certain that when they leave the mall,</i>

6
00:00:31,884 --> 00:00:35,115
<i>they're going back to the remaining canisters. </i>

7
00:00:35,204 --> 00:00:38,196
I'll go along with your assessment.
Let them release it.

8
00:00:38,283 --> 00:00:42,037
But you'd better find those other canisters,
or people will have died in vain.

9
00:00:42,563 --> 00:00:45,760
There is still time to stop them
before they murder those people.

10
00:00:45,842 --> 00:00:47,992
We have a directive from the president.

11
00:00:48,082 --> 00:00:51,518
More people could die
if these men don't lead us to the canisters.

12
00:00:51,601 --> 00:00:53,990
If you were Jack,
would you follow that order?

13
00:00:54,081 --> 00:00:56,117
Stand and watch
as they murder those people?

14
00:00:56,201 --> 00:00:59,351
If those were the orders of the president,
I'd have to.

15
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,038
It's reconfigured.
You can activate the canisters.

16
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,318
You'd better hope it works.
What's the code?

17
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:09,152
Jack, the unlock code is Alpha, Kilo, Charlie.

18
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,309
Echo, Bravo, Charlie.

19
00:01:11,399 --> 00:01:14,072
Jack, this is a direct order from the president.

20
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,753
Now, enter the correct code
and let them release the gas. Now!

21
00:01:17,838 --> 00:01:20,910
- Make it work!
- I told you, there's nothing I can do.

22
00:01:23,557 --> 00:01:25,991
We have another way to release the gas.

23
00:01:30,357 --> 00:01:33,393
I stopped the gas,
but some got into the ventilation.

24
00:01:33,476 --> 00:01:36,149
- Evacuate the mall.
- What about the terrorists?

25
00:01:36,236 --> 00:01:37,793
One's dead, one escaped.

26
00:01:37,876 --> 00:01:42,153
Monitor the tracking device in the remote
trigger. The hostile still had it on him.

27
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:46,672
I managed to activate the valve before I got
away. At least some of the gas was released.

28
00:01:46,754 --> 00:01:49,746
<i>- What do you want me to do?
- Come back here.</i>

29
00:01:51,314 --> 00:01:53,747
<i> You were followed. 
You know what to do. </i>

30
00:01:56,353 --> 00:01:59,390
No! Hostile down.

31
00:01:59,472 --> 00:02:04,181
Erwich and the canisters are gone.
We've got nothing here. Dammit!

32
00:02:10,711 --> 00:02:13,986
<i> Despite an attempt
to derail the process,</i>

33
00:02:14,071 --> 00:02:16,823
<i>the treaty was signed today
by President Logan</i>

34
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:19,139
<i>and Russian president Yuri Suvarov. </i>

35
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:24,826
<i>Officials from each country are hailing it
as a major milestone in US-Russian relations. </i>

36
00:02:24,909 --> 00:02:29,380
<i>The White House press secretary has called
this a critical achievement in diplomacy</i>

37
00:02:29,469 --> 00:02:31,663
<i>and will set the course for President... </i>

38
00:02:31,748 --> 00:02:34,581
The Sentox gas is genuine.

39
00:02:34,668 --> 00:02:37,261
The test was successful.

40
00:02:38,267 --> 00:02:43,261
I spent a year securing a weapon
that would bring Moscow to its knees

41
00:02:43,346 --> 00:02:48,295
and you waste it
killing a handful of American civilians.

42
00:02:51,345 --> 00:02:53,734
We were betrayed, Bierko.

43
00:02:53,825 --> 00:02:55,622
Someone must pay.

44
00:02:55,705 --> 00:02:58,173
I agree.

45
00:03:00,065 --> 00:03:02,453
You're the one who trusted the Americans.

46
00:03:02,544 --> 00:03:06,934
Nathanson lied to us.
He plotted to turn the gas against us.

47
00:03:07,024 --> 00:03:10,254
Your trust nearly cost us everything.

48
00:03:13,542 --> 00:03:20,061
Since I anticipated this, I secured additional
men and resources at great personal expense.

49
00:03:20,141 --> 00:03:23,975
Have you reconfigured the canisters
with dispersal mechanisms?

50
00:03:24,062 --> 00:03:27,848
- Yes.
- Do it. Nathanson will be eliminated.

51
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:30,977
Then we will return to our original task -

52
00:03:31,061 --> 00:03:33,779
striking at the heart of Russia.

53
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:38,932
- Where's Nathanson?
- I don't know where he went.

54
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:41,408
I swear I don't.

55
00:03:56,856 --> 00:03:59,211
- Yeah.
- I took out Nathanson's man.

56
00:04:00,056 --> 00:04:03,605
- But there is no sign of Nathanson.
- Find him.

57
00:04:18,694 --> 00:04:22,289
- Alpha seven.
- It's Nathanson. Someone took out my man.

58
00:04:22,373 --> 00:04:25,206
- Who?
- I think Bierko's hitting us back.

59
00:04:25,293 --> 00:04:27,760
<i>Destroy all your databases. </i>

60
00:04:34,051 --> 00:04:36,326
I know you're there. Pick up the phone.

61
00:04:36,411 --> 00:04:39,801
<i>Dammit, Jenny. 
I need the key card from my wallet. </i>

62
00:04:39,891 --> 00:04:42,040
<i>Look, I'll leave the police out of this. </i>

63
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:46,248
You and your loser boyfriend can keep
the money, max out my cards, I don't care.

64
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:48,366
Just give me back my key card.

65
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:50,644
It's important.

66
00:04:51,089 --> 00:04:55,479
We can't sell the key card.
Why can't we just give it to him?

67
00:04:58,969 --> 00:05:01,528
I'm calling my brother.

68
00:05:01,608 --> 00:05:04,326
- No, you're not.
- What is going on, Dwayne?

69
00:05:04,408 --> 00:05:06,558
I'm handling this.

70
00:05:21,245 --> 00:05:23,679
- Jenny.
Hold for the president.

71
00:05:23,765 --> 00:05:26,598
<i> Have your people
recovered the nerve gas?</i>

72
00:05:26,684 --> 00:05:29,721
- McGill!
- Yes, sir. I'm here. I'm sorry.

73
00:05:29,804 --> 00:05:34,161
Do you have any leads?
Have you intercepted the terrorists?

74
00:05:34,683 --> 00:05:38,232
No. The man we followed took his life
before he could be apprehended.

75
00:05:38,323 --> 00:05:40,120
Dammit! I put this on you.

76
00:05:40,203 --> 00:05:44,559
If you'd let the terrorists release the Sentox
in the mall, as I agreed to let you do,

77
00:05:44,642 --> 00:05:48,237
we wouldn't be where we are right now,
which is nowhere.

78
00:05:48,322 --> 00:05:49,801
- Mr. President...
- Stop!

79
00:05:50,881 --> 00:05:53,190
<i>Stop making excuses. </i>

80
00:05:53,281 --> 00:05:55,316
<i>Take responsibility and do your job. </i>

81
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:08,950
Although we limited the casualties,
the attack indicates

82
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:14,271
that these terrorists intend to make good their
threat to release the nerve gas on US soil.

83
00:06:14,358 --> 00:06:20,876
Unless we catch a break, we can expect
multiple attacks resulting in mass casualties.

84
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:23,835
I assumed you'd want me
to start without you.

85
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:26,146
Just tell me where we are.

86
00:06:27,237 --> 00:06:30,945
LAPD is setting up a perimeter
around the terrorists' last location.

87
00:06:31,036 --> 00:06:34,823
We've activated
satellite and Caltrans surveillance.

88
00:06:34,956 --> 00:06:37,833
But we don't have any real leads, do we?

89
00:06:39,075 --> 00:06:42,510
If Jack followed orders,
we could have intercepted these people.

90
00:06:42,594 --> 00:06:47,542
We don't know that for sure. Jack's field
decision saved over 800 innocent people.

91
00:06:47,634 --> 00:06:49,669
It may well cost us 100 times that many.

92
00:06:49,754 --> 00:06:54,428
We contained the threat and the media's
awareness, which would've triggered unrest.

93
00:06:54,513 --> 00:06:58,187
You tell yourself that.
The fact remains that terrorists are at large

94
00:06:58,273 --> 00:07:02,549
with 19 canisters of Sentox, and we
don't know where or when they'll hit us next.

95
00:07:02,632 --> 00:07:07,785
- We're all aware of the threat, Lynn.
- Then why does she keep defending Bauer?

96
00:07:09,191 --> 00:07:13,342
I want Bauer placed in custody. I want him
brought in here and held responsible.

97
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:17,627
Jack can be disciplined later. Taking him
out of the field right now is a mistake.

98
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:20,621
- Don't tell me how to do my job.
- He was authorised.

99
00:07:20,709 --> 00:07:23,098
He works for me.
So do you. I want him here now.

100
00:07:23,189 --> 00:07:28,501
The rest of you, maintain search protocols.
Send reports to my screen in ten minutes.

101
00:07:32,228 --> 00:07:36,459
It's all right. We're all under a lot of pressure.
Let's get back to it.

102
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:46,861
<i>- Manning.
- It's Buchanan. Bring Jack in. </i>

103
00:07:46,946 --> 00:07:49,061
We weren't able to confirm his identity.

104
00:07:49,146 --> 00:07:52,501
Take his picture, lift his prints,
get him over to CTU.

105
00:07:52,585 --> 00:07:56,783
We've got nothing. We'll have to run him
through NCIC and Interpol databases.

106
00:07:56,864 --> 00:08:00,378
I just got off the phone.
McGill wants me to bring you back to CTU.

107
00:08:00,464 --> 00:08:02,500
He's on some kind of warpath.

108
00:08:02,584 --> 00:08:07,054
Because I didn't think letting terrorists
release Sentox in a mall was acceptable?

109
00:08:07,143 --> 00:08:10,294
We lost our only lead.
Lynn's looking for someone to blame.

110
00:08:10,383 --> 00:08:13,294
I was appointed by the president.
It was a field call.

111
00:08:13,382 --> 00:08:19,491
I know, and between you and me, I think
you made the right call back at the mall.

112
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:23,574
- I'm calling the president.
- Look, Jack, the trail's gone cold.

113
00:08:23,661 --> 00:08:28,780
There's no point in fighting it.
Let's just go back to CTU and square it.

114
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:32,169
- Fine.
- Look, I'm sorry...

115
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:36,969
but I also have to take your gun.

116
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:42,008
Jack, don't make this
any more difficult than it already is.

117
00:08:44,418 --> 00:08:46,214
Fine.

118
00:08:48,417 --> 00:08:51,489
- We can't afford to decommission Jack now.
- I agree.

119
00:08:51,577 --> 00:08:55,455
- Well, what can we do about it?
- Nothing, while Lynn's in charge.

120
00:08:55,537 --> 00:08:58,130
He may be in charge, but he is not in control.

121
00:08:58,576 --> 00:09:00,885
- Ms Raines, you have a call.
- Thank you.

122
00:09:00,976 --> 00:09:03,728
I'll be filtering intel at station three.

123
00:09:06,415 --> 00:09:07,973
Audrey Raines.

124
00:09:08,055 --> 00:09:12,684
If you try to trace this call,
or put anyone else on the line, I will hang up.

125
00:09:12,774 --> 00:09:15,924
- Who is this?
- My name is James Nathanson.

126
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:19,130
I'm sure Walt Cummings
has already told you all about me.

127
00:09:19,213 --> 00:09:23,649
- You sold the nerve gas to the terrorists.
- That's close enough to the truth.

128
00:09:23,733 --> 00:09:27,805
- What do you want?
- Transfer me to Jack Bauer on a clean line.

129
00:09:27,893 --> 00:09:30,485
- Why Jack?
- That's not your concern.

130
00:09:30,572 --> 00:09:34,086
You're getting to Jack through me.
That makes it my concern.

131
00:09:34,171 --> 00:09:39,040
I'm going through you because I know
you have a special relationship with Bauer.

132
00:09:39,131 --> 00:09:42,281
I know all about you,
which is why I'm counting on you

133
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:45,725
to recognise an opportunity
when it presents itself.

134
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:50,087
- What opportunity?
- I can help you find this nerve gas.

135
00:09:50,169 --> 00:09:52,398
How do I know you're telling the truth?

136
00:09:52,489 --> 00:09:54,719
You don't. Now put me through to Bauer.

137
00:10:05,967 --> 00:10:10,881
- This is Bauer.
- Jack, I'm assuming you can't speak freely.

138
00:10:10,967 --> 00:10:14,561
It's Audrey. It's personal.

139
00:10:14,646 --> 00:10:16,477
- Go ahead.
- Thanks.

140
00:10:18,445 --> 00:10:22,596
I'm on the phone with a man who claims
to be James Nathanson, Cummings' contact.

141
00:10:22,685 --> 00:10:25,562
He says he has information,
but he will only talk to you.

142
00:10:25,645 --> 00:10:27,600
<i>- Why me?
- Hang up, Ms Raines. </i>

143
00:10:27,684 --> 00:10:29,675
My phone has a node monitor.

144
00:10:29,763 --> 00:10:32,641
- I'll know if anyone else comes on this line.
- Jack?

145
00:10:32,724 --> 00:10:35,635
- It's all right, Audrey. Hang up the phone.
- All right.

146
00:10:35,723 --> 00:10:39,716
- What do you want with me?
- The terrorists are trying to kill me.

147
00:10:39,802 --> 00:10:43,875
If the terrorists figured out you rigged
the Sentox to blow up in their faces,

148
00:10:43,962 --> 00:10:46,759
why do you need me?
The authorities will protect you.

149
00:10:46,842 --> 00:10:52,313
Cummings isn't the only one behind this who
works in the government. I need your help.

150
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,199
You had me take the fall
for Palmer's assassination.

151
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,350
What makes you think I won't kill you?

152
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:03,390
Because you want to stop the Sentox gas
being released on American soil. So do I.

153
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,312
- Where are you?
- There's a phone booth south of Moorpark.

154
00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:10,908
<i>Be there in ten minutes or I'll be gone. </i>

155
00:11:10,998 --> 00:11:14,149
- Moorpark. Got it.
- Jack.

156
00:11:15,238 --> 00:11:20,186
Audrey, I'll explain everything
as soon as I get back to CTU.

157
00:11:22,277 --> 00:11:24,268
Thanks.

158
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:33,191
It's gotta be strange for her.

159
00:11:35,275 --> 00:11:36,947
Audrey.

160
00:11:37,035 --> 00:11:40,265
Just yesterday, she thought you were dead.

161
00:11:40,355 --> 00:11:42,152
Yeah.

162
00:11:44,474 --> 00:11:49,342
I know this is none of my business,
but she's a good person, Jack.

163
00:11:49,434 --> 00:11:51,708
I hope you two get half a chance.

164
00:11:51,792 --> 00:11:53,351
Thanks.

165
00:12:01,472 --> 00:12:03,860
Jack!

166
00:12:05,911 --> 00:12:08,788
Don't fight, Curtis. Don't fight it.

167
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:14,661
I'm sorry.

168
00:13:00,503 --> 00:13:03,813
<i>- Lynn McGill.
- It's Curtis. Jack escaped. </i>

169
00:13:03,904 --> 00:13:05,222
What?

170
00:13:05,303 --> 00:13:08,613
He got a call. Next thing I know,
he blindsided me and took my car.

171
00:13:08,703 --> 00:13:13,696
<i>- Who called him?
- He said Audrey, but he may have been lying. </i>

172
00:13:14,942 --> 00:13:16,932
<i>Lynn. </i>

173
00:13:17,021 --> 00:13:19,489
We can track your vehicle's transceiver.

174
00:13:19,581 --> 00:13:23,972
I tried bringing it up on my PDA. He's either
disabled or shut down the transceiver.

175
00:13:24,061 --> 00:13:26,415
Curtis, how could you let this happen?

176
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:30,777
I'll get dispatch on it. One of my team's
en route to pick me up. We'll find him.

177
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:35,375
You don't know where to look.
Get back. We'll deploy from here.

178
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:37,494
Dammit!

179
00:13:42,938 --> 00:13:46,328
Chloe, run a triangulation on
Jack Bauer's phone. Find out where he is.

180
00:13:46,418 --> 00:13:48,169
Yes, sir.

181
00:13:49,097 --> 00:13:52,566
Have you talked to Jack
since he's been in custody?

182
00:13:52,657 --> 00:13:54,851
- No.
- He's not in custody any more.

183
00:13:54,936 --> 00:13:57,086
He assaulted Curtis and stole his car.

184
00:13:57,176 --> 00:13:59,848
- Why would he do that?
- Maybe you can tell me.

185
00:13:59,936 --> 00:14:02,847
I don't know where Jack is
if that's what you're asking.

186
00:14:02,935 --> 00:14:06,325
- You have no idea?
- No, but I'm sure there's an explanation.

187
00:14:06,415 --> 00:14:12,410
Mr. McGill? We're not getting a signal from
Jack's cell. The SIM must be out of his phone.

188
00:14:15,653 --> 00:14:18,963
- If you think of anything, let me know, right?
- Of course.

189
00:14:19,053 --> 00:14:21,044
Thanks.

190
00:14:25,892 --> 00:14:28,042
O'Brian.

191
00:14:28,131 --> 00:14:32,090
Chloe, what I'm about to tell you
needs to stay between us.

192
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:34,765
It involves Jack.

193
00:14:34,851 --> 00:14:38,001
What is going on?
It came on my screen Jack's gone missing.

194
00:14:38,091 --> 00:14:40,923
He's following a lead on the gas.
He needed to go alone.

195
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:45,082
I transferred a call from my station to him.
I need you to delete the record.

196
00:14:45,169 --> 00:14:50,118
- If Lynn finds out we're working behind...
- Believe me, I know. But this is the only way.

197
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:52,847
<i>There isn't a lot of time. </i>

198
00:14:55,088 --> 00:14:56,077
When did you call?

199
00:14:56,848 --> 00:14:59,157
<i>- Communications archive. 
- This is McGill.</i>

200
00:14:59,248 --> 00:15:01,886
Bring up the phone logs
of Audrey Raines' station.

201
00:15:01,968 --> 00:15:03,764
Yes, sir.

202
00:15:04,647 --> 00:15:08,037
I found it. I can't dump just one call.
They're cross-indexed.

203
00:15:08,127 --> 00:15:10,765
- Can't you unlink it?
- No, it would take two hours.

204
00:15:11,286 --> 00:15:14,083
OK, Mr. McGill,
the call logs should be on your screen.

205
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:19,192
<i>Scroll through to station five. 
That's the one we dedicated to the DOD.</i>

206
00:15:24,564 --> 00:15:29,842
The only way is to dump the entire log -
all the calls you've made and received today.

207
00:15:30,563 --> 00:15:32,838
Do it.

208
00:15:38,202 --> 00:15:40,557
It's done.

209
00:15:40,642 --> 00:15:43,315
Thank you, Chloe.

210
00:15:52,321 --> 00:15:56,313
<i>... a day to be remembered
as a step forward for the US and Russia. </i>

211
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:01,393
<i>President Logan and President Suvarov are
expected shortly to deliver closing remarks. </i>

212
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,868
<i>Following this, the Russian head of state... </i>

213
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:06,393
- What now?
- There's a call you need to take.

214
00:16:06,478 --> 00:16:08,514
It just came in on this.

215
00:16:08,598 --> 00:16:11,590
- And what is that?
- Walt Cummings' phone, sir.

216
00:16:11,678 --> 00:16:14,953
It's been in Secret Service custody.
They brought it to me.

217
00:16:15,038 --> 00:16:18,154
The caller's claiming he has the Sentox gas.

218
00:16:19,157 --> 00:16:21,432
- Is someone tracing the call?
- They can't.

219
00:16:21,517 --> 00:16:24,667
It's being sent through multiple relays.

220
00:16:27,356 --> 00:16:31,109
I'm not talking to a terrorist.
You talk to them, find out what he wants.

221
00:16:31,195 --> 00:16:35,188
Mr. President,
he's demanding to speak with you.

222
00:16:47,153 --> 00:16:49,826
All right. But put him on speaker.

223
00:16:56,192 --> 00:16:58,500
This is President Logan. Is this Erwich?

224
00:16:58,591 --> 00:17:01,742
Ivan Erwich is no longer with us,
Mr. President.

225
00:17:01,831 --> 00:17:06,062
His attack on your shopping mall
was unsanctioned and unwarranted.

226
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:09,187
It didn't serve our interests.

227
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:17,867
- What is it you want?
- To release the Sentox nerve gas on Moscow.

228
00:17:17,949 --> 00:17:24,137
Since that is impossible, I am forced to strike
at Russia on foreign soil, with your help.

229
00:17:24,788 --> 00:17:28,700
<i>- My help?
- I want the route of Suvarov's motorcade. </i>

230
00:17:28,787 --> 00:17:34,783
<i>His entire route to the airport,
along with a full profile of his security detail. </i>

231
00:17:35,867 --> 00:17:40,178
<i>- I don't personally have that information.
- Then get it. </i>

232
00:17:40,266 --> 00:17:42,382
Make no mistake, Mr. President,

233
00:17:42,865 --> 00:17:47,859
it's our Russian oppressors I mean to hurt,
not your people.

234
00:17:47,945 --> 00:17:50,505
However, if you refuse to cooperate,

235
00:17:50,584 --> 00:17:53,497
I will have no choice
but to release all of the Sentox gas

236
00:17:53,584 --> 00:17:57,975
in areas far more populated
than your shopping mall.

237
00:17:59,183 --> 00:18:04,257
You just said that killing Americans
didn't serve your interests. This...

238
00:18:04,343 --> 00:18:08,255
- This would be senseless murder.
- Yes. It would.

239
00:18:08,342 --> 00:18:10,333
So give me Suvarov's route.

240
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:14,130
- I'll need some time.
- You have 15 minutes.

241
00:18:14,222 --> 00:18:16,530
I'm not sure...

242
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:26,612
He wants to assassinate Suvarov.

243
00:18:28,819 --> 00:18:31,208
We can't let that happen.

244
00:18:33,058 --> 00:18:36,892
If the Russian president is killed on US soil

245
00:18:36,978 --> 00:18:39,367
it wouldn’t just nullify the treaty,

246
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:43,450
it would destroy
our relationship with Moscow.

247
00:18:47,097 --> 00:18:51,612
- Get me Suvarov's route from Secret Service.
- Mr. President...

248
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:53,891
I haven't made any decision yet, Mike,

249
00:18:53,976 --> 00:19:00,050
but whatever I decide, I better have the route
in hand when he calls back, don't you think?

250
00:19:01,895 --> 00:19:03,647
Yes, sir.

251
00:19:21,612 --> 00:19:24,968
Somebody's screwing with me, Bill,
and I won't tolerate it.

252
00:19:25,052 --> 00:19:28,566
- Screwing with you how?
- Audrey's phone log has been erased.

253
00:19:28,651 --> 00:19:30,004
What?

254
00:19:31,451 --> 00:19:34,011
Take a look.

255
00:19:35,731 --> 00:19:39,484
- Probably a system glitch.
- It wasn't a glitch. She did it on purpose.

256
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:41,925
- You think Audrey did this?
- I know she did.

257
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:47,288
- She's one of the most by-the-book people.
- You don't go by the book hiding something.

258
00:19:47,369 --> 00:19:50,360
She was on the phone with Jack
before he attacked Curtis.

259
00:19:50,448 --> 00:19:53,520
I didn't know that. What does that prove?

260
00:19:53,608 --> 00:19:56,884
Something's going on with these two.
What's their history?

261
00:19:56,968 --> 00:20:01,961
You know their history, Lynn.
They worked together at DOD.

262
00:20:02,047 --> 00:20:05,880
- There's more than that, right?
- It got personal later on, yes.

263
00:20:05,966 --> 00:20:08,480
Personal? You didn't think it was important?

264
00:20:08,566 --> 00:20:11,079
No, I didn't. What difference does that make?

265
00:20:12,446 --> 00:20:15,278
When did she find out Jack was still alive?

266
00:20:15,366 --> 00:20:17,560
This morning, with the rest of us.

267
00:20:17,645 --> 00:20:20,523
- You sure about that?
- I was there. I saw her reaction.

268
00:20:20,604 --> 00:20:23,164
- It could've been an act.
- You sound paranoid.

269
00:20:23,244 --> 00:20:26,599
I don't care. From this point,
I want our people on a tight leash.

270
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:28,993
If someone has a hidden agenda,
I wanna know.

271
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:31,517
CTU's become too porous. That's your fault.

272
00:20:31,603 --> 00:20:34,912
- I don't need to hear this from you.
- You don't wanna hear this?

273
00:20:35,002 --> 00:20:38,756
Then tell me why
Audrey erased her phone logs.

274
00:20:43,961 --> 00:20:45,952
Slow down!

275
00:21:01,959 --> 00:21:04,189
- I'm here. Where are you?
- In a minute.

276
00:21:04,279 --> 00:21:07,588
I wanna make sure you weren't followed,
or there's no deal.

277
00:21:08,038 --> 00:21:12,667
<i>Take the alley between the buildings across
the street from you. I left the gate open. </i>

278
00:21:13,957 --> 00:21:17,996
Listen to me. I don't know what you think
I can do, but you committed treason.

279
00:21:18,717 --> 00:21:21,674
I don't see it that way. I love this country.

280
00:21:21,756 --> 00:21:24,986
You're never gonna be able to justify
killing David Palmer.

281
00:21:25,076 --> 00:21:30,433
That was an unfortunate necessity. We
admired Palmer, but we had other priorities.

282
00:21:30,515 --> 00:21:33,473
This country needs a reason
to secure its oil interests in Asia,

283
00:21:33,675 --> 00:21:35,744
one Russia and the world can get behind.

284
00:21:35,835 --> 00:21:38,712
I've heard your reasoning from Walt.
It's treason.

285
00:21:38,794 --> 00:21:41,433
<i>No, it's a real politic. </i>

286
00:21:43,433 --> 00:21:45,742
- Do you see the open door ahead?
- Yeah.

287
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:50,383
<i>Enter it. Make two right turns
and walk back the direction you came from. </i>

288
00:21:50,472 --> 00:21:53,270
Hold on.

289
00:21:57,632 --> 00:22:02,021
You have hostiles coming from the adjacent
parking structure. Do you have a weapon?

290
00:22:02,111 --> 00:22:03,589
- Yes.
- Where are you?

291
00:22:03,671 --> 00:22:07,140
- Second floor.
- Make your way to the roof. Stay on the line.

292
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:08,629
All right.

293
00:22:13,189 --> 00:22:16,101
- All right, I understand.
- Audrey.

294
00:22:16,189 --> 00:22:20,704
DOD wants a fuller explanation about the
mall. I told them we're trying to find the gas.

295
00:22:20,788 --> 00:22:24,463
I just spent the last five minutes
getting grilled by Lynn.

296
00:22:24,548 --> 00:22:28,301
- About what?
- You and Jack. Your relationship.

297
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:30,821
- What did you tell him?
- The truth.

298
00:22:30,907 --> 00:22:33,705
That you and he were involved,
but now I'm not sure.

299
00:22:33,786 --> 00:22:36,301
- That's not his business.
- He thinks it is.

300
00:22:36,386 --> 00:22:41,698
He thinks you had something
to do with Jack breaking from custody.

301
00:22:43,066 --> 00:22:46,296
- Did you?
- Not exactly.

302
00:22:48,704 --> 00:22:52,936
- What the hell does that mean?
- A man claiming to be Nathanson called here.

303
00:22:53,024 --> 00:22:57,256
He said he had information on the terrorists,
that he would only give it to Jack.

304
00:22:57,343 --> 00:23:02,292
- Why didn't you tell me about this?
- I was afraid. I didn't know what to do, Bill.

305
00:23:02,383 --> 00:23:05,499
So Jack's meeting this man alone,
without backup. Where?

306
00:23:05,582 --> 00:23:08,619
- I don't know. He dropped me from the call.
- Who else knows?

307
00:23:08,702 --> 00:23:12,057
- Chloe. She helped cover the call from Lynn.
Audrey.

308
00:23:12,142 --> 00:23:14,939
- Sign here.
- District elevated the threat level.

309
00:23:15,021 --> 00:23:19,411
I'm briefing first responders on multiple
attacks. I need to review DOD protocols.

310
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:23,971
- All right, I'll send them to your screen.
- We can do it here.

311
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:27,813
- Unless you have a problem working on this.
- No, no, no. It's fine.

312
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,129
Excuse me.

313
00:23:35,058 --> 00:23:36,889
- Bauer?
- Yeah, where are you?

314
00:23:36,978 --> 00:23:43,052
- I'm in the freight elevator.
- You need to get out now. You're cornered.

315
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:42,883
<i>- Bauer, where are you?
- I'm almost there. Just keep moving.</i>

316
00:25:39,522 --> 00:25:42,081
Nathanson, stay down!

317
00:25:42,162 --> 00:25:43,594
Stay down!

318
00:26:13,877 --> 00:26:15,788
Nathanson!

319
00:26:19,197 --> 00:26:23,394
Look at me. Look at me.
How do I find the canisters of Sentox?

320
00:26:23,475 --> 00:26:25,625
How do I find the canisters?

321
00:26:25,715 --> 00:26:27,865
In my pocket.

322
00:26:35,554 --> 00:26:39,671
What's on the chip?
Please! What's on the chip?

323
00:26:53,992 --> 00:26:57,301
- He's dead, but there was someone else.
- Who?

324
00:26:57,391 --> 00:27:01,225
I don't know, but he took out three of my men
and disabled the helicopter.

325
00:27:01,311 --> 00:27:04,985
Nathanson may have given him information
that compromises us.

326
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:07,788
<i>Keep looking until you find him. </i>

327
00:27:11,109 --> 00:27:14,101
<i> Critics have said
by signing this treaty,</i>

328
00:27:14,189 --> 00:27:17,544
<i>we as the United States
are taking on our allies' enemies</i>

329
00:27:17,629 --> 00:27:19,778
<i>as well as having to deal with our own. </i>

330
00:27:20,787 --> 00:27:24,701
Diagram seven lays out the hierarchy.

331
00:27:24,787 --> 00:27:28,018
Civil-defence protocols
for each agency are well-defined.

332
00:27:28,107 --> 00:27:30,416
Shouldn't you get that?

333
00:27:31,826 --> 00:27:35,421
- Audrey Raines.
- Nathanson's been killed. He gave me intel.

334
00:27:35,506 --> 00:27:36,984
Uplink the data.

335
00:27:37,066 --> 00:27:42,617
Sorry, Steve, you have the wrong extension.
I'll transfer you to IT.

336
00:27:42,705 --> 00:27:47,017
Overlapping responsibilities
default to federal, then to state.

337
00:27:47,105 --> 00:27:51,335
- O'Brian.
- It's Jack. What's the hell's going on there?

338
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:56,338
It's Lynn, he's shadowing her. He thinks she's
been talking to you, which I guess she has.

339
00:27:56,423 --> 00:27:59,699
Listen. I have a ThumbDrive
that's gonna help find the Sentox.

340
00:27:59,783 --> 00:28:03,218
- I need you to data-mine the files.
- Upload the drive to my socket.

341
00:28:03,302 --> 00:28:05,418
Access code 5 J55 J.

342
00:28:05,501 --> 00:28:06,855
Hold on.

343
00:28:10,781 --> 00:28:14,819
You should be getting it now.
Chloe, I need you to keep this under the radar.

344
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:16,891
You mean keep it from Lynn.

345
00:28:16,981 --> 00:28:19,540
Until we know what we've got.
My number come up?

346
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:21,895
- Yeah.
- OK. I had to switch out phones.

347
00:28:21,979 --> 00:28:25,494
- If you need me, call me on that number.
- OK, I will.

348
00:28:53,135 --> 00:28:56,605
Suvarov's motorcade route
and security detail.

349
00:28:56,695 --> 00:28:58,811
Sir,

350
00:28:58,895 --> 00:29:02,046
if President Suvarov is killed
and the Russians find out

351
00:29:02,135 --> 00:29:05,251
we supplied his killers with this information,

352
00:29:05,334 --> 00:29:08,132
it would be considered an act of war.

353
00:29:08,213 --> 00:29:10,443
The motorcade has a security force.

354
00:29:10,533 --> 00:29:16,243
I see no reason to believe
that the terrorists would even be successful.

355
00:29:16,332 --> 00:29:21,280
Maybe we should have an analysis done,
determine vulnerable points along the route.

356
00:29:21,371 --> 00:29:24,284
Sir, we can't do that
without giving away the fact

357
00:29:24,371 --> 00:29:27,249
that we had advance knowledge of an attack.

358
00:29:28,251 --> 00:29:30,286
What attack?

359
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:37,766
It's nothing that you need
to be concerned about.

360
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:41,167
Charles, you invited me into this circle.

361
00:29:41,249 --> 00:29:43,399
What attack?

362
00:29:51,527 --> 00:29:55,156
The terrorists want
the Suvarovs' motorcade route.

363
00:29:55,247 --> 00:30:00,718
They've threatened to deploy
more Sentox gas if I don't give it to them.

364
00:30:01,726 --> 00:30:05,035
You're not seriously considering it, are you?

365
00:30:08,445 --> 00:30:13,121
Martha, Charles believes an assault
on the Suvarovs has a good chance...

366
00:30:13,204 --> 00:30:17,403
Will you please
let the president speak for himself?

367
00:30:19,844 --> 00:30:22,311
May we have a moment?

368
00:30:39,401 --> 00:30:42,393
- Charles.
- Martha, please.

369
00:30:42,481 --> 00:30:45,040
If I don't give them the information they want,

370
00:30:45,121 --> 00:30:50,147
tens of thousands of Americans will die
on our soil, maybe hundreds of thousands.

371
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:55,836
All right. Charles, there's got to be another
way. Change their itinerary. Delay Suvarov.

372
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:59,309
It's all over the news
that they're leaving after the statement.

373
00:30:59,398 --> 00:31:02,913
If there's any deviation,
the terrorists will know I alerted them.

374
00:31:02,998 --> 00:31:08,310
Charles, what are you telling me? That we will
stand in front of the world with the Suvarovs,

375
00:31:08,397 --> 00:31:11,547
you'll look him in the eye
knowing you're sending them...

376
00:31:11,637 --> 00:31:16,028
If we were in Russia and Suvarov got this
ultimatum, do you think he would spare us?

377
00:31:16,117 --> 00:31:20,393
I'm not talking about Russia
or about Suvarov. I am talking about you.

378
00:31:20,476 --> 00:31:23,309
You are the President
of the United States of America.

379
00:31:23,395 --> 00:31:26,273
My God, Charles!
You're talking about murder!

380
00:31:26,355 --> 00:31:31,587
Martha, my back is up against the wall.
You... Give me another solution.

381
00:31:31,674 --> 00:31:35,462
You stand up to them.
Refuse to negotiate with them.

382
00:31:35,554 --> 00:31:39,990
Isn't that the policy of this country?
Isn't that the point of the treaty you signed?

383
00:31:40,073 --> 00:31:43,030
It's not that simple, Martha.

384
00:31:43,113 --> 00:31:45,023
It never is.

385
00:31:58,911 --> 00:32:01,549
Dammit!

386
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:07,779
<i>- Buchanan.
- This is Chloe. </i>

387
00:32:07,869 --> 00:32:10,337
- What is it?
- Jack just sent me the data he got.

388
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:13,262
My filters weren't working
and I just realised why.

389
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:15,782
<i>- The drive's DOD-formatted. 
- DOD?</i>

390
00:32:15,868 --> 00:32:19,064
I don't know how Nathanson
got a highly classified D-drive.

391
00:32:19,148 --> 00:32:21,661
<i>Audrey's the only one with clearance. </i>

392
00:32:22,667 --> 00:32:25,704
<i>- Lynn's got her tied up.
- Exactly. </i>

393
00:32:25,787 --> 00:32:28,859
- How much time do you need?
- To decrypt it? Three minutes.

394
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:30,938
Hang on.

395
00:32:32,706 --> 00:32:35,015
Lynn, do you have a minute?

396
00:32:37,826 --> 00:32:41,703
- What is it?
- You were inquiring about the phone logs.

397
00:32:42,465 --> 00:32:43,738
That's right.

398
00:32:43,824 --> 00:32:48,693
I had Felson run a diagnostic
to trace the terminal that dumped the log.

399
00:32:53,224 --> 00:32:56,533
We can key in the user ID
from your office to find what we need.

400
00:32:56,623 --> 00:32:59,659
We just have to use your key card.

401
00:32:59,742 --> 00:33:05,020
Why are you so interested in this?
- I'm serious about all breaches of security.

402
00:33:05,822 --> 00:33:08,211
- What was that?
- What?

403
00:33:08,302 --> 00:33:12,134
- That last window you closed. What was it?
- It was just the DOD protocols.

404
00:33:12,221 --> 00:33:15,895
- What is going on here?
Will you please just calm down?

405
00:33:15,981 --> 00:33:19,575
Don't tell me to calm down.
You're up to something. I won't stand for it.

406
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:22,332
You're protecting her, she's protecting Bauer.

407
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:24,057
- I can explain.
- So can I.

408
00:33:24,139 --> 00:33:27,415
- This was an attempt to circumvent me.
- We are on the same side.

409
00:33:27,499 --> 00:33:31,128
If your father wasn't secretary of defense,
I'd have you thrown out.

410
00:33:31,218 --> 00:33:33,448
I don't have that problem with you.

411
00:33:34,458 --> 00:33:37,894
Can I have security to station five, please?
Right away.

412
00:33:37,977 --> 00:33:41,652
- What are you doing, Lynn?
- Place him in custody. Take him to Holding.

413
00:33:41,737 --> 00:33:44,968
- You are making a mistake.
- Audrey.

414
00:33:51,975 --> 00:33:53,772
I want everyone's attention.

415
00:33:53,855 --> 00:33:57,972
I'm putting a section two-three redundancy
into effect as of this moment.

416
00:33:58,055 --> 00:34:01,444
Your stations will be mirrored
and monitored through my office.

417
00:34:01,534 --> 00:34:03,604
Now get back to work.

418
00:34:04,614 --> 00:34:09,004
We need Bill to get through this. You are
jeopardising our chances of finding that gas.

419
00:34:09,093 --> 00:34:11,687
I'll make DOD
and the secretary of defense aware.

420
00:34:11,773 --> 00:34:17,768
Don't threaten me, Ms Raines. I promise
you, you do not want to threaten me.

421
00:34:37,089 --> 00:34:40,161
- What have you got?
- A company called Terra-Dyne.

422
00:34:40,249 --> 00:34:44,446
Over three years they've acquired
over 100 pounds of raw strontium isotope,

423
00:34:44,528 --> 00:34:46,519
used to create Sentox nerve gas.

424
00:34:46,608 --> 00:34:52,319
- Where do I find Terra-Dyne?
- La Canada. It's a subsidiary of Omicron.

425
00:34:52,407 --> 00:34:56,035
- Did you say Omicron? Are you sure?
- What's wrong?

426
00:34:56,126 --> 00:34:59,641
Pull up their roster.
See if Christopher Henderson is on the list.

427
00:34:59,726 --> 00:35:02,923
- Why?
- Just do it, please.

428
00:35:05,006 --> 00:35:06,882
Here it is. Christopher Henderson.

429
00:35:06,965 --> 00:35:11,197
Senior vice president of research
and development. Do you know him?

430
00:35:11,285 --> 00:35:15,960
Yeah, I did once. Listen,
send me the decrypted files over to my PDA.

431
00:35:16,044 --> 00:35:19,513
That's gonna be hard to do.
Lynn is watching everyone like a hawk.

432
00:35:19,603 --> 00:35:22,118
- Can Buchanan help?
- If he weren't in Holding.

433
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:25,513
- What?
- Lynn detained him for insubordination.

434
00:35:25,602 --> 00:35:27,719
- How can he do that?
- He's losing it.

435
00:35:27,802 --> 00:35:32,353
The president's putting pressure on him
to get those canisters. He can't handle it.

436
00:35:32,442 --> 00:35:35,797
I need the files. You're gonna
have to find a way to get them to me.

437
00:35:35,881 --> 00:35:37,200
I'll try.

438
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:44,598
- They haven't called yet?
- No, they haven't, sir.

439
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:47,240
President Suvarov's waiting.

440
00:35:50,559 --> 00:35:52,868
We'll be out in a minute.

441
00:35:53,919 --> 00:35:55,910
Excuse me.

442
00:35:59,358 --> 00:36:01,508
Martha.

443
00:36:01,598 --> 00:36:04,032
Please?

444
00:36:04,118 --> 00:36:06,631
This is a difficult decision for me,

445
00:36:06,718 --> 00:36:10,426
both politically and personally,
and maybe I won't have to make it.

446
00:36:10,517 --> 00:36:14,304
Maybe CTU will find the canisters
before the Suvarovs have to leave.

447
00:36:14,397 --> 00:36:16,956
That's what I'm praying for.

448
00:36:17,476 --> 00:36:19,705
But whatever happens,

449
00:36:19,795 --> 00:36:22,263
I need you to understand.

450
00:36:23,635 --> 00:36:27,707
I do... understand, Charles. I do.

451
00:36:27,794 --> 00:36:29,785
Mr. President.

452
00:36:36,833 --> 00:36:40,428
It has been a challenging day,
so I especially appreciate

453
00:36:40,512 --> 00:36:43,390
how professional you have all been.

454
00:36:43,473 --> 00:36:49,501
Your president is fortunate to have such
talented people working for him. Thank you.

455
00:36:49,591 --> 00:36:50,740
Yuri.

456
00:36:52,591 --> 00:36:54,865
Anya.

457
00:36:55,671 --> 00:36:58,184
Mr. President,
I'm glad we have this opportunity

458
00:36:58,271 --> 00:37:02,148
to thank you and Mrs. Logan personally
for your hospitality.

459
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:06,541
Mr. President, it's been our pleasure.

460
00:37:06,629 --> 00:37:08,984
Yes.

461
00:37:09,069 --> 00:37:10,899
Hold on.

462
00:37:10,989 --> 00:37:13,058
We would love that.

463
00:37:13,148 --> 00:37:15,503
Wouldn't we, Martha?

464
00:37:15,588 --> 00:37:17,863
Yes. It would be lovely.

465
00:37:18,787 --> 00:37:20,982
Martha,

466
00:37:21,067 --> 00:37:23,820
thank you again for being so kind.

467
00:37:23,907 --> 00:37:26,943
I read the text of your statement.
It was excellent.

468
00:37:27,026 --> 00:37:31,019
And congratulations again
on your handling of the crisis at the airport.

469
00:37:31,106 --> 00:37:36,055
Thank you, Yuri.
And thank you for your steadfast support.

470
00:37:37,745 --> 00:37:41,498
Have there been
further developments?

471
00:37:41,585 --> 00:37:44,144
No, no, none at all.

472
00:37:44,224 --> 00:37:46,579
There's always pressure.

473
00:37:46,664 --> 00:37:49,973
- But everything's under control.
Yes.

474
00:37:50,063 --> 00:37:52,497
Ladies, the photographers are waiting.

475
00:37:52,583 --> 00:37:55,143
Thank you, Mr. President.

476
00:37:59,142 --> 00:38:02,259
The motorcade will take
service roads to the 118,

477
00:38:02,342 --> 00:38:04,650
and then to the 5 Freeway South.

478
00:38:05,581 --> 00:38:08,618
- Charles.
- Martha, please, just...

479
00:38:08,701 --> 00:38:11,089
just smile and wave.

480
00:38:19,419 --> 00:38:24,095
The motorcade will take Suvarov
through this downtown corridor.

481
00:38:24,178 --> 00:38:27,933
That will give us our best shot
at destroying all the vehicles.

482
00:38:28,018 --> 00:38:32,135
Tell our people
this is where I want them to strike.

483
00:39:01,974 --> 00:39:04,885
All right, that's it, folks. We need to move.

484
00:39:08,933 --> 00:39:12,891
- Come on.
- Charles. You can't let them get in that car.

485
00:39:12,973 --> 00:39:17,409
- It's not too late.
- Lynn McGill is calling from CTU.

486
00:39:17,492 --> 00:39:20,961
- What about?
- He didn't say. He asked to speak with you.

487
00:39:21,051 --> 00:39:22,882
Excuse me.

488
00:39:23,891 --> 00:39:28,645
I'm afraid I have to say my goodbyes here.
Affairs of state, the pressures continue.

489
00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:30,924
Yes, I understand, of course.

490
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:33,921
Thank you, President Logan, for everything.

491
00:39:34,689 --> 00:39:37,362
Thank you. Anya.

492
00:39:40,529 --> 00:39:42,484
Charles.

493
00:39:49,848 --> 00:39:51,166
- Mrs. Logan.
- Aaron.

494
00:39:51,247 --> 00:39:55,478
I've decided to drive to the airport
with the Suvarovs. You can have a car follow.

495
00:39:55,567 --> 00:39:58,126
We're not detailed for that.

496
00:40:00,486 --> 00:40:04,683
- I'll ride up front.
- No, Aaron. No. That's not necessary.

497
00:40:04,765 --> 00:40:06,915
Yes, it is.

498
00:40:10,685 --> 00:40:13,562
Thank you. Would you...

499
00:40:15,884 --> 00:40:18,478
tell my husband where I am?

500
00:40:25,802 --> 00:40:28,680
I hope you don't mind if I accompany you.

501
00:40:29,682 --> 00:40:32,640
- Are you sure your husband won't mind?
- Of course not.

502
00:40:32,721 --> 00:40:35,394
This way we'll have more time to talk.

503
00:40:35,481 --> 00:40:37,472
I'd like that.

504
00:40:37,561 --> 00:40:42,918
Ma'am, the president is being briefed by CTU
right now, but I left word for you.

505
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,831
Thank you.
