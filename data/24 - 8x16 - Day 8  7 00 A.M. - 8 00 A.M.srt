2
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:14,674
Hassan isn't happy

3
00:00:14,742 --> 00:00:15,942
about Taylor's response
to the ultimatum.

4
00:00:16,009 --> 00:00:17,543
If he wants to take it up
with President Taylor,

5
00:00:17,611 --> 00:00:18,811
he can do it when he's...

6
00:00:20,214 --> 00:00:21,848
- Put your gun down.
-    Omar, what are you doing?

7
00:00:21,915 --> 00:00:22,815
Mr. President...

8
00:00:22,883 --> 00:00:25,017
My life or tens of thousands?

9
00:00:25,085 --> 00:00:26,586
I couldn't live with that.

10
00:00:26,653 --> 00:00:28,354
<i>What if they
blow up the bomb anyway?

11
00:00:28,422 --> 00:00:29,956
At least I've tried
to stop the attack.

12
00:00:31,492 --> 00:00:33,726
We've got less than five
minutes, we gotta move.

13
00:00:33,794 --> 00:00:35,395
Mr. President,
you can't trust him!

14
00:00:35,462 --> 00:00:37,530
Don't move, hands
where we can see them!

15
00:00:38,565 --> 00:00:39,665
Is he still alive?

16
00:00:39,733 --> 00:00:40,700
Yes, ma'am.

17
00:00:40,768 --> 00:00:44,170
Where is President Hassan?

18
00:00:44,238 --> 00:00:45,371
<i>I don't know.

19
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:47,039
Don't lie to me!

20
00:00:47,107 --> 00:00:49,709
They have Hassan;
we have the bomb.

21
00:00:49,777 --> 00:00:52,211
The bomb's at Amsterdam
and 93rd.

22
00:00:52,279 --> 00:00:54,313
We know that President
Hassan was handed over

23
00:00:54,381 --> 00:00:56,282
approximately ten minutes ago.

24
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:58,351
<i>We have an ambush point yet?

25
00:00:58,419 --> 00:01:01,687
Yes, intersection of
161st and Amsterdam.

26
00:01:01,755 --> 00:01:02,722
<i>CTU is following you.

27
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:04,123
Can you find me an exit?

28
00:01:04,191 --> 00:01:05,491
There's one between 158th

29
00:01:05,559 --> 00:01:07,927
<i>and 159th... parking garage.

30
00:01:08,962 --> 00:01:11,197
<i>Damn it, they've made us!

31
00:01:11,265 --> 00:01:13,166
He's breaking left!
I repeat, he's breaking left!

32
00:01:13,233 --> 00:01:16,102
<i>I've got him, he's going
back into the garage.

33
00:01:18,605 --> 00:01:21,107
He's coming straight
at me, damn it!

34
00:01:26,413 --> 00:01:27,713
You know where to go.

35
00:01:33,654 --> 00:01:35,555
<i>- Have you got Hassan?</i>
- No.

36
00:01:35,622 --> 00:01:37,056
The driver managed to transfer
Hassan to another vehicle

37
00:01:37,124 --> 00:01:38,391
before I could get to him.

38
00:01:38,459 --> 00:01:40,326
Someone inside CTU's
gotta be tipping them off.

39
00:01:40,394 --> 00:01:41,527
It's only a matter of time

40
00:01:41,595 --> 00:01:42,895
before this gets
traced back to me.

41
00:01:42,963 --> 00:01:45,431
I need to get the hell out
of here while I still can.

42
00:01:59,446 --> 00:02:01,514
Uh, excuse me, Ms. Walsh?

43
00:02:01,582 --> 00:02:03,449
I need to see your passkey.

44
00:02:03,517 --> 00:02:04,784
What's this about?

45
00:02:04,852 --> 00:02:06,853
It's a new security protocol
because of the EMP attack.

46
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,155
Nobody gets in or out
without personally being

47
00:02:09,223 --> 00:02:11,791
cleared by Mr. Hastings.

48
00:02:21,502 --> 00:02:23,002
I can't let you through.

49
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:24,537
You haven't been coded out.

50
00:02:24,605 --> 00:02:26,205
Well, I'm not leaving.

51
00:02:26,273 --> 00:02:27,974
I'm just going to my car.

52
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:29,842
I'm sorry, you'll have
to talk to Mr. Hastings.

53
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,544
Hastings is in the middle
of a crisis.

54
00:02:31,612 --> 00:02:32,912
It'll just be a couple minutes.

55
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,714
No one will even
know I was gone.

56
00:02:34,781 --> 00:02:35,948
Look...

57
00:02:36,016 --> 00:02:38,985
I just want to go get
my migraine meds.

58
00:02:39,052 --> 00:02:40,620
Please don't make me beg.

59
00:02:42,956 --> 00:02:45,024
All right, tell you what,

60
00:02:45,092 --> 00:02:47,293
I'll have one of my men
run out to your car,

61
00:02:47,361 --> 00:02:48,094
grab your medication.

62
00:02:48,161 --> 00:02:49,829
Give me your keys.

63
00:02:49,897 --> 00:02:51,464
You know, that's fine,
your men are busy enough.

64
00:02:51,532 --> 00:02:52,798
I'll talk to Hastings.

65
00:02:52,866 --> 00:02:54,901
- You sure?
- Yep.

66
00:02:57,371 --> 00:02:59,372
Thank you, Jim.

67
00:03:10,117 --> 00:03:11,651
Only one car left
the parking garage.

68
00:03:11,718 --> 00:03:13,920
One minute after the crash.

69
00:03:13,987 --> 00:03:15,688
Northeast exit,
a blonde woman was driving.

70
00:03:15,756 --> 00:03:17,023
Hassan was probably in it.

71
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:18,190
Can you track it?

72
00:03:18,258 --> 00:03:19,959
No, it left
the satellite grid.

73
00:03:20,027 --> 00:03:21,928
Damn it.
Put out an APB on that car.

74
00:03:21,995 --> 00:03:23,996
- Yes, sir.
- Scan the NSA servers.

75
00:03:24,064 --> 00:03:25,831
- See if they've picked up any chatter.
- Yes, sir.

76
00:03:25,899 --> 00:03:27,700
Mr. Hastings, the
President's on line one,

77
00:03:27,768 --> 00:03:29,669
- she'd like an update.
- Great, thank you.

78
00:03:29,736 --> 00:03:31,037
Madam President, Brian Hastings.

79
00:03:31,104 --> 00:03:32,738
Mr. Hastings, I saw the crash.

80
00:03:32,806 --> 00:03:35,141
Please tell me
President Hassan survived.

81
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:37,243
Actually, we just learned
that President Hassan was not

82
00:03:37,311 --> 00:03:38,744
<i>in the vehicle.

83
00:03:38,812 --> 00:03:39,946
I don't understand.

84
00:03:40,013 --> 00:03:41,113
<i>During the pursuit,
we believe

85
00:03:41,181 --> 00:03:42,682
he was switched
to another car.

86
00:03:42,749 --> 00:03:43,950
We're trying
to track it now.

87
00:03:44,017 --> 00:03:46,319
- Then he's still alive.
- It appears so, ma'am.

88
00:03:46,386 --> 00:03:47,553
If the terrorists
wanted him dead,

89
00:03:47,621 --> 00:03:48,721
they would've killed him on site.

90
00:03:48,789 --> 00:03:50,523
They must have another agenda.

91
00:03:50,591 --> 00:03:52,658
I don't even want to speculate
on what that might be.

92
00:03:52,726 --> 00:03:55,094
We will keep you apprised,
Madam President.

93
00:03:55,162 --> 00:03:57,396
Thank you.

94
00:04:02,436 --> 00:04:03,803
What is happening?

95
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,004
Is my father alive?

96
00:04:05,072 --> 00:04:09,141
We think so, but he's
still in the hands

97
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:11,978
of the terrorists.
Now, CTU

98
00:04:12,045 --> 00:04:14,113
- is searching for him now.
- Then there's still hope.

99
00:04:14,181 --> 00:04:16,549
- Yes.
-<i> Excuse me...

100
00:04:16,617 --> 00:04:18,451
Madam President, the Russian
Foreign Minister is outside.

101
00:04:18,518 --> 00:04:20,620
He wants
to speak with you.

102
00:04:20,687 --> 00:04:22,488
I'll be right there.

103
00:04:22,556 --> 00:04:26,025
I can't imagine how hard

104
00:04:26,093 --> 00:04:28,027
this is for both of you.

105
00:04:28,095 --> 00:04:29,962
Please know that
I'm committing

106
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:32,732
every resource at my disposal
to finding him.

107
00:04:43,477 --> 00:04:45,211
Mr. Novakovich.

108
00:04:45,278 --> 00:04:46,545
What can I do for you?

109
00:04:46,613 --> 00:04:48,848
Thank you for seeing me,
Madam President.

110
00:04:48,915 --> 00:04:50,316
I know that you are very busy.

111
00:04:50,384 --> 00:04:51,283
It's all right.

112
00:04:51,351 --> 00:04:53,285
Please.

113
00:04:53,353 --> 00:04:55,855
Can I assume there is no change

114
00:04:55,922 --> 00:04:57,890
in the status
of President Hassan?

115
00:04:57,958 --> 00:05:00,026
I'm afraid not.

116
00:05:00,093 --> 00:05:01,727
Then he is still being
held by terrorists.

117
00:05:01,795 --> 00:05:03,696
For now, yes.

118
00:05:03,764 --> 00:05:06,465
Are you hopeful that
CTU can recover him?

119
00:05:06,533 --> 00:05:10,670
We're following a lead now,
and, yes, we are very hopeful.

120
00:05:10,737 --> 00:05:12,571
What is the nature of the lead?

121
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,441
I'd rather not
get into specifics.

122
00:05:15,509 --> 00:05:17,910
You'll be told the
second we know more.

123
00:05:17,978 --> 00:05:21,280
Madam President,
I need to stress

124
00:05:21,348 --> 00:05:23,449
that if Hassan is not found,
his government

125
00:05:23,517 --> 00:05:24,884
will be in disarray.

126
00:05:24,951 --> 00:05:26,886
The peace agreement will
have no chance of success.

127
00:05:26,953 --> 00:05:31,223
I'm aware of that, but there's...
there's no point in speculating

128
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:32,892
on the worst-case scenario;
we're not there yet.

129
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:35,428
I just want to make
our position clear.

130
00:05:35,495 --> 00:05:38,464
If Hassan dies,
there is no agreement.

131
00:05:38,532 --> 00:05:42,201
If I didn't know better,

132
00:05:42,269 --> 00:05:45,004
I'd think you were hoping
for that to happen.

133
00:05:45,072 --> 00:05:46,939
- Madam President!
- You believe this treaty

134
00:05:47,007 --> 00:05:48,941
weakens your influence
in the region.

135
00:05:49,009 --> 00:05:51,544
Your country has been looking
for any excuse to pull out.

136
00:05:51,611 --> 00:05:54,046
I realize you are under
a great deal of pressure,

137
00:05:54,114 --> 00:05:55,915
but there is no reason for
these baseless accusations.

138
00:05:55,982 --> 00:06:00,252
My country has been
more than supportive.

139
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,922
We are here, are we not?

140
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:08,027
Perhaps I spoke too harshly.

141
00:06:08,095 --> 00:06:09,929
I just don't need
you to remind me

142
00:06:09,996 --> 00:06:12,965
how perilous this situation is.

143
00:06:13,033 --> 00:06:15,935
I do appreciate your support,

144
00:06:16,002 --> 00:06:18,904
and I hope that
I can count on it

145
00:06:18,972 --> 00:06:21,407
until we find President Hassan.

146
00:06:21,475 --> 00:06:25,010
Of course, Madam President.

147
00:06:33,186 --> 00:06:37,123
Chloe, can I talk
to you for a second?

148
00:06:40,093 --> 00:06:41,794
We've got a problem.

149
00:06:41,862 --> 00:06:43,429
Jack thinks that
someone inside of CTU

150
00:06:43,497 --> 00:06:44,764
is working for
the terrorists.

151
00:06:44,831 --> 00:06:46,132
Why does he think that?

152
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:48,134
They must've been warned
that they were being followed.

153
00:06:48,201 --> 00:06:50,202
That's why they transferred
Hassan to a different car.

154
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:52,271
Yeah, that bothered me too.

155
00:06:52,339 --> 00:06:54,340
And then there was a satellite
glitch that happened earlier.

156
00:06:54,407 --> 00:06:55,574
- What glitch?
- The glitch that allowed

157
00:06:55,642 --> 00:06:57,443
the terrorists to get away
in the first place.

158
00:06:57,511 --> 00:07:00,079
It was a little too unlucky;
especially for us.

159
00:07:00,147 --> 00:07:01,714
Jack recovered Tarin's
cell phone from the crash.

160
00:07:01,782 --> 00:07:03,349
If someone did call
to tip him off,

161
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:04,984
we can get the number
off the memory.

162
00:07:05,051 --> 00:07:07,353
Jack's on his way
back to CTU now.

163
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:08,754
He wants you to call him
on a proprietary line

164
00:07:08,822 --> 00:07:09,622
so he can upload the data.

165
00:07:09,689 --> 00:07:11,957
- All right.
- Go.

166
00:07:21,034 --> 00:07:22,301
I'm ready to receive.

167
00:07:22,369 --> 00:07:24,303
I'm calling Jack now.

168
00:07:25,739 --> 00:07:27,072
This is Bauer.

169
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,607
Jack, it's Chloe,
Renee filled me in.

170
00:07:28,675 --> 00:07:29,775
Good, I'm going to upload

171
00:07:29,843 --> 00:07:31,210
the cell phone data
to your station.

172
00:07:31,278 --> 00:07:33,445
- What's your I.D. number?
- 91770.

173
00:07:33,513 --> 00:07:35,381
91770.

174
00:07:35,448 --> 00:07:38,617
Chloe, it's encrypted... you're
gonna have to work fast.

175
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,527
Excuse me, sir, I need
to access your workstation.

176
00:07:48,595 --> 00:07:49,895
What for?

177
00:07:49,963 --> 00:07:52,331
I want to make sure all the
parameters reset properly

178
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:53,766
- after the EMP.
- Can't that wait?

179
00:07:53,834 --> 00:07:55,968
No... if the parameters are off
we could lose more data.

180
00:07:57,904 --> 00:08:00,506
- How long?
- Couple minutes.

181
00:08:00,574 --> 00:08:01,874
Go ahead.

182
00:08:05,345 --> 00:08:06,812
Hastings.

183
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,247
<i>Mr. Hastings, it's Chloe.

184
00:08:08,315 --> 00:08:10,916
I need to talk to you at my
station, it's important.

185
00:08:10,984 --> 00:08:12,151
What is it, Chloe?

186
00:08:12,219 --> 00:08:13,452
I'll explain when you get here.

187
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,722
I'm on my way.

188
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:18,591
Let me know
when you're finished.

189
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,709
All right, what is it?

190
00:08:36,776 --> 00:08:38,978
We think someone inside of CTU
is working with the terrorists.

191
00:08:39,045 --> 00:08:40,412
What are you talking about?

192
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,381
They switched Hassan
to a different car

193
00:08:42,449 --> 00:08:44,283
because they knew they
were being followed.

194
00:08:44,351 --> 00:08:46,552
Jack recovered Tarin's
cell phone from the crash.

195
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,420
Chloe's decrypting
the data right now.

196
00:08:48,488 --> 00:08:50,222
Who the hell is it?

197
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:52,691
The data's coming in now;
it'll take a second.

198
00:08:55,528 --> 00:08:57,396
Okay, there.
These are all the calls

199
00:08:57,464 --> 00:08:58,998
that Tarin made
in the past hour.

200
00:08:59,065 --> 00:08:59,932
That's one of ours.

201
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,300
It's one of the cell phones

202
00:09:01,368 --> 00:09:03,602
NSA provided to us
right after the EMP hit.

203
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:05,037
Who was issued that phone?

204
00:09:05,105 --> 00:09:07,273
They were logged in
by hand; hold on.

205
00:09:23,323 --> 00:09:24,857
That's Dana's phone.

206
00:09:29,729 --> 00:09:30,763
Where is she?

207
00:09:34,167 --> 00:09:36,602
I checked with Hastings;
he cleared me through, Jim.

208
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:37,770
How's that migraine?

209
00:09:37,837 --> 00:09:39,972
Worse than ever,
thanks to you.

210
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,141
Sorry about that.
Just doing my job.

211
00:09:46,179 --> 00:09:47,646
Stay where you are
and keep your hands...

212
00:09:57,657 --> 00:09:59,325
Security monitors, main screen.

213
00:10:04,564 --> 00:10:05,864
We need a medical team
to the main entrance.

214
00:10:05,932 --> 00:10:06,865
What's going on?

215
00:10:06,933 --> 00:10:08,367
Why is there a 112
out on Dana?

216
00:10:08,435 --> 00:10:10,235
She's working with the terrorists.

217
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:11,804
Just shot two security guards.

218
00:10:11,871 --> 00:10:13,105
She's trying
to leave the building.

219
00:10:13,173 --> 00:10:14,273
Wait a minute, what the hell
are you talking about?

220
00:10:14,341 --> 00:10:15,674
We traced a call
from her cell phone

221
00:10:15,742 --> 00:10:17,009
to one of the terrorists.

222
00:10:17,077 --> 00:10:18,711
She's been working
with them, Cole.

223
00:10:18,778 --> 00:10:20,079
What the hell
did you know about this?

224
00:10:20,146 --> 00:10:21,146
Nothing, sir!

225
00:10:21,214 --> 00:10:23,515
She just entered
the parking garage.

226
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:25,985
She's heading for
the north end of level two.

227
00:10:26,052 --> 00:10:27,753
- She's going for her car.
- Cole... Cole!

228
00:10:29,089 --> 00:10:30,889
Notify Security,
lock down the exits.

229
00:11:32,118 --> 00:11:35,154
Get out of the car now!

230
00:11:38,191 --> 00:11:39,858
Who are you, you lying bitch?

231
00:11:41,194 --> 00:11:43,195
Who are you?!

232
00:11:44,264 --> 00:11:46,398
Cole! Let her go!

233
00:11:46,466 --> 00:11:48,801
Cole, let her go.

234
00:11:48,868 --> 00:11:50,903
Cole...

235
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:52,771
I said let her go.

236
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:02,915
Where's Hassan?

237
00:12:04,951 --> 00:12:08,087
You're going to talk to me
one way or the other.

238
00:12:09,956 --> 00:12:12,291
I said, where are
they taking Hassan?

239
00:12:12,358 --> 00:12:14,326
I want to talk to Jack Bauer.

240
00:12:16,796 --> 00:12:19,431
You want answers...

241
00:12:19,499 --> 00:12:21,633
get Bauer.

242
00:12:25,305 --> 00:12:27,606
Get her out of here.

243
00:12:51,439 --> 00:12:54,041
If her name's not Dana
Walsh, then who is she?

244
00:12:55,076 --> 00:12:57,744
Her real name's Jenny Scott.

245
00:12:57,812 --> 00:13:00,747
At least that's
what she told me.

246
00:13:00,815 --> 00:13:03,517
I don't know
what to believe anymore.

247
00:13:03,584 --> 00:13:06,586
But she said she did
some bad things in her past.

248
00:13:06,654 --> 00:13:08,288
That's why she had
to change her identity.

249
00:13:08,356 --> 00:13:09,556
What bad things?

250
00:13:09,624 --> 00:13:12,459
She was involved with a felon.

251
00:13:12,527 --> 00:13:14,728
They committed
some armed robberies.

252
00:13:16,297 --> 00:13:18,231
Someone got killed.

253
00:13:18,299 --> 00:13:21,334
Look, that's all I know,
but it's not relevant

254
00:13:21,402 --> 00:13:22,536
to finding Hassan.

255
00:13:22,603 --> 00:13:24,838
You let me decide what is
relevant and what is not.

256
00:13:24,906 --> 00:13:26,440
Why and hell didn't
you report any of this?

257
00:13:26,507 --> 00:13:28,375
Oh, I just found out
about it a few hours ago.

258
00:13:28,443 --> 00:13:29,943
That is not an excuse.

259
00:13:32,513 --> 00:13:33,980
I know, sir.

260
00:13:36,951 --> 00:13:39,886
I guess I was just
trying to protect her.

261
00:13:39,954 --> 00:13:42,122
I wasn't thinking straight.

262
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:44,725
So when you and Dana,
or whatever her name is,

263
00:13:44,792 --> 00:13:46,727
went AWOL,
what was that about?

264
00:13:46,794 --> 00:13:49,596
It's a long story, sir,

265
00:13:49,664 --> 00:13:52,466
and it won't help us
find President Hassan.

266
00:13:52,533 --> 00:13:53,633
I'll make a full debrief

267
00:13:53,701 --> 00:13:55,736
once this is all over,
but until it is,

268
00:13:55,803 --> 00:14:00,440
please, let me stay on duty.

269
00:14:00,508 --> 00:14:03,076
I know I screwed up, but I've
been running Hassan's security

270
00:14:03,144 --> 00:14:04,811
for the last month.

271
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:06,913
Give me a chance
to make this right.

272
00:14:12,153 --> 00:14:13,653
Hastings.

273
00:14:13,721 --> 00:14:15,922
<i>Sir, you wanted to be told
when Jack Bauer got here.

274
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:17,124
<i>He just arrived.

275
00:14:17,191 --> 00:14:18,425
Send him to interrogation.

276
00:14:18,493 --> 00:14:19,726
<i>Yes, sir.

277
00:14:20,995 --> 00:14:22,829
You get over to debrief.

278
00:14:22,897 --> 00:14:24,164
Sir, you need me on this.

279
00:14:24,232 --> 00:14:25,632
I need people I can trust.

280
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,634
You want
to make this right?

281
00:14:27,702 --> 00:14:30,103
Then start by getting down
everything you know.

282
00:14:30,171 --> 00:14:32,172
Then we'll talk.

283
00:14:41,716 --> 00:14:44,084
What's happening?

284
00:14:44,152 --> 00:14:46,820
You were right. They had
someone inside of CTU.

285
00:14:46,888 --> 00:14:48,588
Dana Walsh.
She's an analyst.

286
00:14:48,656 --> 00:14:50,490
We checked the phone
data you sent over.

287
00:14:50,558 --> 00:14:52,692
She's the one that called
Tarin before he crashed.

288
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,461
She must've warned him that
he was being pursued.

289
00:14:54,529 --> 00:14:55,829
Anybody know
who she really is?

290
00:14:55,897 --> 00:14:58,298
She's not saying anything
until she talks to you.

291
00:14:58,366 --> 00:15:00,267
Me? Why?

292
00:15:00,334 --> 00:15:02,302
She won't say.

293
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:05,138
- Jack, are you up to speed?
- Yeah.

294
00:15:05,206 --> 00:15:07,541
I just spoke with Agent Ortiz.
You know he was her fiancé.

295
00:15:07,608 --> 00:15:08,942
Well, that would explain
a few things.

296
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:10,343
He doesn't know much,
only that she had

297
00:15:10,411 --> 00:15:11,545
some kind of criminal
past, and altered

298
00:15:11,612 --> 00:15:13,380
her identity to infiltrate CTU.

299
00:15:13,447 --> 00:15:14,648
Not an easy task.

300
00:15:14,715 --> 00:15:16,216
Well, she obviously
had help from someone.

301
00:15:16,284 --> 00:15:17,984
However she did this,
we need to find out.

302
00:15:18,052 --> 00:15:19,119
You think Cole's clean?

303
00:15:19,187 --> 00:15:20,821
I think he's telling the truth,

304
00:15:20,888 --> 00:15:22,856
but after this,
I'm not sure

305
00:15:22,924 --> 00:15:24,958
I trust my own opinion.
I thought I knew Dana Walsh.

306
00:15:25,026 --> 00:15:27,227
Cole's clean.

307
00:15:27,295 --> 00:15:29,196
Why does she want
to talk to you, Jack?

308
00:15:29,263 --> 00:15:31,464
Don't know.
Just met her today.

309
00:15:31,532 --> 00:15:34,034
But I think
we should find out, don't you?

310
00:15:34,101 --> 00:15:36,102
Open up.

311
00:15:39,073 --> 00:15:41,408
You stand down for now.

312
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:46,313
Just so we're clear,
as far as I'm concerned,

313
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,181
I kept up my end of our deal.

314
00:15:48,249 --> 00:15:49,850
The nuclear rods
were recovered.

315
00:15:49,917 --> 00:15:51,918
The only reason why
I'm still here is because

316
00:15:51,986 --> 00:15:53,286
I gave President Taylor my word

317
00:15:53,354 --> 00:15:54,654
that I would protect
President Hassan.

318
00:15:54,722 --> 00:15:56,056
I know.

319
00:15:56,123 --> 00:15:58,124
Okay, thank you.

320
00:16:00,728 --> 00:16:02,195
Biometrics ready?

321
00:16:02,263 --> 00:16:03,663
Yes, sir.

322
00:16:11,939 --> 00:16:14,341
They said I was the only one
you wanted to talk to.

323
00:16:14,408 --> 00:16:16,176
Why?

324
00:16:16,244 --> 00:16:17,644
Because you're the only one here

325
00:16:17,712 --> 00:16:19,613
who doesn't have his head
up his ass.

326
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,250
So let's not
waste any time.

327
00:16:23,317 --> 00:16:25,752
You want President Hassan,
I can get him for you.

328
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,921
I know where they're taking him.
I know what they're planning

329
00:16:27,989 --> 00:16:29,389
to do.

330
00:16:29,457 --> 00:16:30,457
What do you want?

331
00:16:30,524 --> 00:16:31,791
You know the drill.

332
00:16:31,859 --> 00:16:33,627
Full immunity, clean record.

333
00:16:33,694 --> 00:16:35,695
And I want
to be compensated.

334
00:16:35,763 --> 00:16:37,898
Compensated?

335
00:16:37,965 --> 00:16:39,566
When you get these IRK agents,

336
00:16:39,634 --> 00:16:41,368
you're gonna get your hands
on their cash.

337
00:16:41,435 --> 00:16:42,602
I want my share.

338
00:16:44,171 --> 00:16:47,107
I lost a lot of money
when this deal went south.

339
00:16:47,174 --> 00:16:49,376
You're telling me
all of this is about money?

340
00:16:49,443 --> 00:16:51,978
Isn't it always?

341
00:16:55,316 --> 00:16:57,751
If I'm going to take this
to the President,

342
00:16:57,818 --> 00:17:01,154
I need proof that
you know something worthwhile.

343
00:17:01,222 --> 00:17:02,622
Well, in about a half an hour,

344
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:04,324
you will have
all the proof you need...

345
00:17:04,392 --> 00:17:06,793
Hassan's head.

346
00:17:07,862 --> 00:17:09,596
You little bitch.

347
00:17:11,999 --> 00:17:14,301
Let me explain
something to you.

348
00:17:14,368 --> 00:17:16,102
Damn it, Jack!

349
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:18,571
The only reason you've got
any leverage right now is

350
00:17:18,639 --> 00:17:19,906
because President Hassan
is alive.

351
00:17:19,974 --> 00:17:21,908
So stop screwing with me!

352
00:17:21,976 --> 00:17:25,078
They are going to force him
to make a statement,

353
00:17:25,146 --> 00:17:26,980
and then they're going
to kill him,

354
00:17:27,048 --> 00:17:29,783
live over the Internet.

355
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:32,285
So I suggest
we stop haggling

356
00:17:32,353 --> 00:17:33,787
and you start
making this happen.

357
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,829
Fine. I'll take this
to the President.

358
00:17:42,897 --> 00:17:45,765
But you better understand

359
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:48,735
that if we don't recover
President Hassan alive...

360
00:17:48,803 --> 00:17:50,804
you get nothing.

361
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:54,708
Nothing.

362
00:17:56,544 --> 00:17:58,345
It's why I asked for you,

363
00:17:58,412 --> 00:17:59,446
Mr. Bauer.

364
00:17:59,513 --> 00:18:00,780
It's part of the deal.

365
00:18:00,848 --> 00:18:02,282
You're going
to handle this operation.

366
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:04,351
Hassan is heavily
protected.

367
00:18:04,418 --> 00:18:08,488
I need someone with your
experience running the show.

368
00:18:08,556 --> 00:18:11,024
There's been enough
screwups for one day...

369
00:18:11,092 --> 00:18:13,059
don't you think?

370
00:18:13,127 --> 00:18:15,362
Earlier, you said
you lost a lot of money

371
00:18:15,429 --> 00:18:16,663
because the deal went bad.

372
00:18:16,731 --> 00:18:19,232
Who was supposed
to pay you?

373
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:22,502
Tick-tock, Mr. Bauer.

374
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:25,872
You're running
out of time.

375
00:18:27,174 --> 00:18:28,842
Open the door.

376
00:18:33,347 --> 00:18:35,548
So what do the
biometrics say?

377
00:18:35,616 --> 00:18:38,318
Autonomics are stable.
No deception.

378
00:18:38,386 --> 00:18:40,053
I wouldn't put much faith
in those readings.

379
00:18:40,121 --> 00:18:41,855
She's a sociopath.
She cannot be trusted.

380
00:18:41,922 --> 00:18:43,523
Renee's right... this isn't just
about the money for her.

381
00:18:43,591 --> 00:18:44,791
She's hiding something.

382
00:18:44,859 --> 00:18:46,326
But given the timeframe
that we have,

383
00:18:46,394 --> 00:18:47,694
we need to follow
through with this.

384
00:18:47,762 --> 00:18:49,262
How do you want to play it?

385
00:18:50,431 --> 00:18:53,566
We need to call the President.

386
00:20:16,717 --> 00:20:18,518
Hassan is here.

387
00:20:18,586 --> 00:20:19,886
They're bringing him up.

388
00:20:19,954 --> 00:20:21,521
Samir, we should
kill him now.

389
00:20:21,589 --> 00:20:23,590
The entire city is
looking for him.

390
00:20:23,657 --> 00:20:25,992
It's not enough to kill him.

391
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:28,161
We heed him
to confess his crimes,

392
00:20:28,229 --> 00:20:29,329
renounce his lies.

393
00:20:29,396 --> 00:20:31,197
The longer we delay,
the better the chance

394
00:20:31,265 --> 00:20:33,533
the Americans will find
him and try to rescue him.

395
00:20:33,601 --> 00:20:34,767
He will never be rescued.

396
00:20:34,835 --> 00:20:36,736
He will die

397
00:20:36,804 --> 00:20:38,571
right here.

398
00:20:38,639 --> 00:20:39,806
Samir?

399
00:20:58,325 --> 00:21:00,059
Do you remember me?

400
00:21:02,663 --> 00:21:04,898
I was a young man when we met.

401
00:21:04,965 --> 00:21:07,467
You were a general
in the Revolutionary Guard.

402
00:21:07,535 --> 00:21:10,803
I had the honor
of briefing you

403
00:21:10,871 --> 00:21:12,972
on our operations
in Abul Province.

404
00:21:15,309 --> 00:21:17,977
You were a great leader then.

405
00:21:22,616 --> 00:21:24,551
What happened?

406
00:21:24,618 --> 00:21:27,086
Why did you turn
your back on our country?

407
00:21:31,659 --> 00:21:33,660
It is you...

408
00:21:34,929 --> 00:21:37,931
...you who has betrayed
our country.

409
00:21:37,998 --> 00:21:39,933
No.

410
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,102
I'm fighting to keep us strong.

411
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:45,271
You have chosen
to surrender to the West.

412
00:21:45,339 --> 00:21:47,273
It's not surrender.

413
00:21:47,341 --> 00:21:49,309
It's an honorable

414
00:21:49,376 --> 00:21:53,379
peace... that will
strengthen our country.

415
00:21:55,149 --> 00:21:57,283
I do remember you.

416
00:21:57,351 --> 00:21:59,185
Do you remember
the campaign

417
00:21:59,253 --> 00:22:02,322
we fought to secure
the perimeter

418
00:22:02,389 --> 00:22:03,990
of Abul?

419
00:22:04,058 --> 00:22:05,658
Yes, I do.

420
00:22:05,726 --> 00:22:08,761
The other generals said I was
leading my men into defeat.

421
00:22:08,829 --> 00:22:10,496
But we fought.

422
00:22:10,564 --> 00:22:13,066
For four long days.

423
00:22:13,133 --> 00:22:16,135
I believed in my heart
that victory was possible.

424
00:22:18,205 --> 00:22:20,206
And I was right.

425
00:22:22,643 --> 00:22:25,645
I'm not saying I'm never wrong.

426
00:22:29,149 --> 00:22:31,084
But I believe...

427
00:22:31,151 --> 00:22:34,153
just as strongly in
this peace agreement.

428
00:22:36,991 --> 00:22:39,759
All I'm asking...

429
00:22:39,827 --> 00:22:42,462
is that you put your faith
in me once again.

430
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:49,335
I implore you
to stop this madness.

431
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:05,318
The next thing you say...

432
00:23:05,386 --> 00:23:10,156
will be an apology to
every citizen of the IRK.

433
00:23:10,224 --> 00:23:13,126
You will beg forgiveness
for your treason,

434
00:23:13,193 --> 00:23:16,129
and you will renounce
the peace agreement.

435
00:23:16,196 --> 00:23:18,698
That will never happen.

436
00:23:18,766 --> 00:23:21,634
I'll never do that.

437
00:23:21,702 --> 00:23:24,037
I will never do that.

438
00:23:24,104 --> 00:23:26,739
Oh, you will.

439
00:23:26,807 --> 00:23:29,909
It just depends on
how long it takes.

440
00:23:29,977 --> 00:23:32,845
And how much pain
you can endure.

441
00:24:00,411 --> 00:24:03,046
This immunity agreement's
made out to "Dana Walsh."

442
00:24:03,113 --> 00:24:05,081
But it's my understanding
that's not her real name.

443
00:24:05,149 --> 00:24:07,016
The lawyers are aware
of that, ma'am.

444
00:24:07,084 --> 00:24:09,052
They say the agreement
will hold.

445
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:10,653
Too bad.

446
00:24:10,721 --> 00:24:13,623
I thought for a moment there
we had a way out.

447
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:18,261
I'll get these to
CTU right away.

448
00:24:18,329 --> 00:24:19,529
Thank you, Tim.

449
00:24:20,798 --> 00:24:22,799
Thank you.

450
00:24:27,738 --> 00:24:30,306
Ethan.

451
00:24:30,374 --> 00:24:32,709
Still here, Madam President.

452
00:24:34,745 --> 00:24:37,146
Are you going
to be all right?

453
00:24:37,214 --> 00:24:39,983
I'll let my doctors
field that one.

454
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:41,217
They're running tests.

455
00:24:41,285 --> 00:24:42,252
Good.

456
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:44,754
Madam President,

457
00:24:44,822 --> 00:24:46,756
what's the situation
with Hassan?

458
00:24:46,824 --> 00:24:48,758
Is he safe?

459
00:24:48,826 --> 00:24:51,060
They have him, Ethan.

460
00:24:51,128 --> 00:24:52,662
The IRK agents have Hassan.

461
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:55,064
Oh, dear God.

462
00:24:55,132 --> 00:24:57,100
They're going to kill him.

463
00:24:57,167 --> 00:25:01,204
Not if CTU can
get there in time.

464
00:25:01,272 --> 00:25:02,539
There's a rescue
operation underway.

465
00:25:02,606 --> 00:25:03,873
They know where he is?

466
00:25:03,941 --> 00:25:05,909
They will shortly.

467
00:25:05,976 --> 00:25:08,945
The terrorists had someone
working for them inside CTU,

468
00:25:09,013 --> 00:25:11,848
an analyst named Dana Walsh.

469
00:25:11,916 --> 00:25:14,017
I've agreed to a conditional
immunity deal

470
00:25:14,084 --> 00:25:15,552
in exchange for her cooperation.

471
00:25:15,619 --> 00:25:17,186
Conditional on what?

472
00:25:17,254 --> 00:25:19,389
Omar Hassan's safe return.

473
00:25:22,459 --> 00:25:25,395
Ethan...
there's a real possibility

474
00:25:25,462 --> 00:25:27,864
Hassan won't survive this.

475
00:25:27,932 --> 00:25:30,366
I hate to even think about it,

476
00:25:30,434 --> 00:25:32,535
but we have to be prepared.

477
00:25:32,603 --> 00:25:35,371
Is there any chance that
the person who succeeds Hassan

478
00:25:35,439 --> 00:25:37,707
will be someone
we can deal with?

479
00:25:37,775 --> 00:25:39,709
The IRK constitution is vague

480
00:25:39,777 --> 00:25:41,744
when it comes to succession
of power.

481
00:25:41,812 --> 00:25:44,514
There's no telling who'd
take his place.

482
00:25:44,582 --> 00:25:47,550
Besides, Hassan
barely was able

483
00:25:47,618 --> 00:25:50,119
to form a consensus in
his own administration.

484
00:25:50,187 --> 00:25:52,322
It took a man of
his charisma

485
00:25:52,389 --> 00:25:54,958
and passion to achieve that.

486
00:25:56,927 --> 00:25:59,062
I'm sorry to be so negative,
Madam President,

487
00:25:59,129 --> 00:26:01,064
but we have to be realistic.

488
00:26:01,131 --> 00:26:04,500
Without Hassan,
there can be no peace.

489
00:26:09,473 --> 00:26:11,975
They're ready to start
the briefing with Dana...

490
00:26:12,042 --> 00:26:14,043
or whatever her name is.

491
00:26:15,512 --> 00:26:16,946
- Arlo?
- Yeah. I heard you.

492
00:26:17,814 --> 00:26:19,014
You work with someone for a year,

493
00:26:19,034 --> 00:26:20,683
you think you know them.
How did we all miss this?

494
00:26:20,751 --> 00:26:22,685
I always knew there was
something wrong with her.

495
00:26:22,753 --> 00:26:23,920
She was a little too perfect.

496
00:26:23,988 --> 00:26:25,688
But I never imagined
she'd be a terrorist.

497
00:26:25,756 --> 00:26:27,223
I should've seen it.

498
00:26:27,291 --> 00:26:29,025
She was acting weird all day.

499
00:26:29,093 --> 00:26:31,027
Maybe if I'd been looking
in the right spot,

500
00:26:31,095 --> 00:26:33,363
like somewhere
in the vicinity of her face,

501
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:35,498
I might've noticed
something useful.

502
00:26:35,566 --> 00:26:37,567
She played us.
Get over it.

503
00:26:44,041 --> 00:26:46,042
Sit down.

504
00:26:51,081 --> 00:26:53,116
I'm only telling you this
because you're going

505
00:26:53,183 --> 00:26:55,118
to find out soon enough.

506
00:26:55,185 --> 00:26:57,620
Dana's been given provisional
immunity by the President.

507
00:26:57,688 --> 00:26:59,355
What?!

508
00:26:59,423 --> 00:27:01,391
She's providing us
with intelligence

509
00:27:01,458 --> 00:27:03,393
as to the whereabouts of the
people holding President Hassan.

510
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:05,061
I don't care what
she's providing.

511
00:27:05,129 --> 00:27:06,729
She's a traitor and a murderer!

512
00:27:06,797 --> 00:27:07,964
Cole...

513
00:27:08,032 --> 00:27:09,699
You can't let her walk!
Not her!

514
00:27:09,767 --> 00:27:11,367
Stop.

515
00:27:12,403 --> 00:27:14,537
I know you've been burned...

516
00:27:14,605 --> 00:27:17,674
professionally,
personally.

517
00:27:17,741 --> 00:27:19,242
Get over it.

518
00:27:21,078 --> 00:27:23,846
Jack Bauer's heading up the
operation to rescue President Hassan.

519
00:27:23,914 --> 00:27:25,648
He wants you on his team.

520
00:27:25,716 --> 00:27:27,884
But Dana

521
00:27:27,951 --> 00:27:29,886
is briefing the group.

522
00:27:29,953 --> 00:27:31,521
Do you have a problem with that?

523
00:27:33,557 --> 00:27:34,757
No, sir.

524
00:27:34,825 --> 00:27:36,025
I'm fine.

525
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:41,197
Good.

526
00:27:43,233 --> 00:27:46,102
Stand by outside
the conference room.

527
00:27:49,106 --> 00:27:51,541
His name is Samir Mehran.

528
00:27:51,608 --> 00:27:53,376
Before the IRK planted him here,

529
00:27:53,444 --> 00:27:55,378
he was a soldier with the
Revolutionary Guard.

530
00:27:55,446 --> 00:27:58,214
Altogether, he has about
six men left.

531
00:27:58,282 --> 00:27:59,782
You killed the rest.

532
00:28:04,188 --> 00:28:06,222
You're absolutely sure that's
where they're holding Hassan?

533
00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:08,257
Yes. The entrance
to the tenement

534
00:28:08,325 --> 00:28:10,693
is on Holland Avenue with
exits to the rear and east side.

535
00:28:10,761 --> 00:28:14,197
He'll have at least
a couple lookouts stationed.

536
00:28:14,264 --> 00:28:15,398
What's the apartment number?

537
00:28:15,466 --> 00:28:16,532
I don't know.

538
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,567
What's the apartment number?

539
00:28:17,634 --> 00:28:19,669
If I knew, I would tell you.

540
00:28:19,737 --> 00:28:21,604
Somewhere above the
first floor.

541
00:28:21,672 --> 00:28:22,772
What makes you say that?

542
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:23,773
Because the building
is populated.

543
00:28:23,841 --> 00:28:26,275
Some families.

544
00:28:26,343 --> 00:28:27,944
Samir will want to use them
as human shields

545
00:28:28,011 --> 00:28:30,680
in the event of
a frontal attack.

546
00:28:32,983 --> 00:28:34,517
We got what we need.

547
00:28:34,585 --> 00:28:35,551
We have to move.

548
00:28:35,619 --> 00:28:37,520
Secure the prisoner.

549
00:28:38,522 --> 00:28:40,056
Take her to holding.

550
00:28:40,124 --> 00:28:42,058
Hey. You all right?

551
00:28:42,126 --> 00:28:43,493
Yeah, I'm ready to go.

552
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,628
Get your men and assemble
them in the motor pool.

553
00:28:50,834 --> 00:28:52,835
Let's move.

554
00:28:54,938 --> 00:28:56,939
Let's go.

555
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:36,371
Just read the statement, Omar.

556
00:29:37,407 --> 00:29:39,741
Put an end to this.

557
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:43,946
This is only going to get worse.

558
00:29:44,013 --> 00:29:47,216
Tell the people you've
made a terrible mistake.

559
00:29:47,283 --> 00:29:49,318
Atone for your sins.

560
00:29:51,354 --> 00:29:54,356
You are wasting your time.

561
00:29:56,993 --> 00:29:59,995
I will never do what you ask.

562
00:30:20,984 --> 00:30:22,951
Read the statement, Omar,

563
00:30:23,019 --> 00:30:25,854
or I will start cutting
pieces from your body.

564
00:30:27,891 --> 00:30:31,326
Whether I live...

565
00:30:31,394 --> 00:30:34,329
or I die...

566
00:30:34,397 --> 00:30:36,365
this peace will happen somehow.

567
00:30:36,432 --> 00:30:39,067
And men like you

568
00:30:39,135 --> 00:30:40,769
will have no place to hide.

569
00:30:40,837 --> 00:30:44,706
This peace dies
right here with you!

570
00:30:47,343 --> 00:30:49,278
You said the drug would
break down his resistance.

571
00:30:49,345 --> 00:30:50,412
It should be working.

572
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,880
Give him another injection.

573
00:30:51,948 --> 00:30:53,115
Any more could kill him.

574
00:30:53,182 --> 00:30:55,117
I don't care.

575
00:30:55,184 --> 00:30:56,418
Do it.

576
00:30:59,122 --> 00:31:01,957
Samir, we can't continue
this forever.

577
00:31:02,025 --> 00:31:06,128
If he won't read the statement,
we must think of something else.

578
00:31:06,195 --> 00:31:07,796
He will break.

579
00:31:07,864 --> 00:31:09,631
I know it.

580
00:31:09,699 --> 00:31:11,133
He's stronger
than we thought.

581
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,468
We need to accept it.

582
00:31:16,839 --> 00:31:17,973
Stop.

583
00:31:20,143 --> 00:31:22,010
Prepare the Internet feed.

584
00:31:22,078 --> 00:31:24,313
What are you going to do?

585
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:27,015
I will tell the world
of his crimes.

586
00:31:28,651 --> 00:31:31,186
And carry out his sentence.

587
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:40,128
Madam President,
I just got word from CTU.

588
00:31:40,196 --> 00:31:42,164
Their tactical team is
approaching th staging area.

589
00:31:42,231 --> 00:31:45,167
They also have
real-time uplink.

590
00:31:45,234 --> 00:31:47,402
Dalia and Kayla Hassan have
asked to speak with you.

591
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:49,471
They're in the
waiting area.

592
00:31:56,079 --> 00:31:58,046
I was told
you found my husband.

593
00:31:58,114 --> 00:32:00,048
He's being held in
an apartment building.

594
00:32:00,116 --> 00:32:01,984
CTU is preparing to go in

595
00:32:02,051 --> 00:32:03,118
after him.

596
00:32:03,186 --> 00:32:04,486
Do they know if
he's still alive?

597
00:32:04,554 --> 00:32:07,489
We believe that he is,
but we can't be sure.

598
00:32:07,557 --> 00:32:09,391
We have our best
men in the field

599
00:32:09,459 --> 00:32:11,460
and they're going to do
everything they can

600
00:32:11,527 --> 00:32:13,028
to save your
husband's life.

601
00:32:13,096 --> 00:32:15,297
But you cannot guarantee
he will be saved.

602
00:32:15,365 --> 00:32:17,399
I'm afraid not.

603
00:32:17,467 --> 00:32:19,701
But I assure you,
we're going to do everything

604
00:32:19,769 --> 00:32:21,703
we can.

605
00:32:21,771 --> 00:32:23,672
Thank you, Madam President.

606
00:32:25,241 --> 00:32:27,909
Madam President, we need you
in the situation room.

607
00:32:27,977 --> 00:32:30,946
We'll know something very soon.

608
00:32:39,055 --> 00:32:41,556
NSA just red-flagged a live feed
going out on the Internet.

609
00:32:41,624 --> 00:32:44,226
It's President Hassan.

610
00:32:48,231 --> 00:32:50,432
Put it through.

611
00:32:53,603 --> 00:32:55,670
<i>President Hassan is
a traitor to his country.

612
00:32:55,738 --> 00:32:59,741
<i>His belief that we must
capitulate to the infidels

613
00:32:59,809 --> 00:33:02,511
<i>nearly condemned our people
to a life of subjugation.

614
00:33:02,578 --> 00:33:06,014
<i>What follows is a list
of his crimes.

615
00:33:06,082 --> 00:33:10,118
<i>You will see that he deserves
the harshest punishment.

616
00:33:10,186 --> 00:33:13,021
<i>Hassan has tortured
and sent his bulldogs

617
00:33:13,089 --> 00:33:14,756
<i>on other leaders
of the society.

618
00:33:14,824 --> 00:33:16,291
<i>The scholars...

619
00:33:16,359 --> 00:33:18,760
Does the video give us any clue

620
00:33:18,828 --> 00:33:21,029
to Hassan's location
in the building?

621
00:33:21,097 --> 00:33:22,197
Look at the shadows
behind his head.

622
00:33:22,265 --> 00:33:24,800
The light coming from
the left is natural light.

623
00:33:24,867 --> 00:33:26,635
It's a window.

624
00:33:26,702 --> 00:33:28,203
You're sure that's daylight?

625
00:33:28,271 --> 00:33:31,373
Yes, the light temperature
is 5,600 degrees Kelvin.

626
00:33:31,441 --> 00:33:34,576
That's the building where Dana
said Hassan is being held.

627
00:33:34,644 --> 00:33:36,545
Based on the angle
of the shadows,

628
00:33:36,612 --> 00:33:38,213
they're in an east-facing apartment.

629
00:33:38,281 --> 00:33:39,981
By the height of the
surrounding buildings,

630
00:33:40,049 --> 00:33:42,050
they're on the fourth floor.

631
00:33:42,118 --> 00:33:44,219
Sir, the drone
is in position.

632
00:33:44,287 --> 00:33:45,687
There are two lookouts
on the roof.

633
00:33:48,157 --> 00:33:50,859
Patch me through to Jack.

634
00:33:57,733 --> 00:34:00,435
It's Bauer.

635
00:34:00,503 --> 00:34:03,004
Jack, we've got a good fix
on Hassan's location.

636
00:34:03,072 --> 00:34:05,907
We think he's in an east facing
apartment on the fourth floor.

637
00:34:05,975 --> 00:34:08,844
We also confirm two look-outs
on the roof, both armed.

638
00:34:08,911 --> 00:34:11,480
- North and south corner.
- Copy that.

639
00:34:11,547 --> 00:34:12,881
You need to hurry, Jack.

640
00:34:12,949 --> 00:34:14,516
The terrorist is running
a live Internet feed.

641
00:34:14,584 --> 00:34:17,385
He's reading a list of
Hassan's so-called crimes.

642
00:34:17,453 --> 00:34:19,821
As soon as he's done,
he's going to execute him.

643
00:34:19,889 --> 00:34:21,089
We're at the staging area;
I'll let you know

644
00:34:21,157 --> 00:34:21,957
as soon as we're moving in.

645
00:34:22,024 --> 00:34:24,326
- Is this everyone?
- Yes, sir.

646
00:34:24,393 --> 00:34:26,828
Okay, Cole, I want you and your
team to take down the lookouts;

647
00:34:26,896 --> 00:34:28,964
I want coordinated kill shots
and I want you to cover

648
00:34:29,031 --> 00:34:30,599
the perimeter
as we move in.

649
00:34:30,666 --> 00:34:32,434
Charters, Bank, you're
gonna be with me.

650
00:34:32,502 --> 00:34:34,436
We're gonna use audio
surveillance to locate

651
00:34:34,504 --> 00:34:36,004
the apartment where they're
holding President Hassan.

652
00:34:36,072 --> 00:34:38,206
I want all of you to silence
your weapons.

653
00:34:38,274 --> 00:34:39,374
The only way this
operation works

654
00:34:39,442 --> 00:34:40,876
is if we take these
terrorists by surprise.

655
00:34:40,943 --> 00:34:42,711
If they get a sense that
we're moving in on them,

656
00:34:42,778 --> 00:34:44,613
President Hassan is dead.

657
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:46,648
I don't have to tell you
what we're up against,

658
00:34:46,716 --> 00:34:48,550
and the significance
of this operation.

659
00:34:48,618 --> 00:34:50,685
Trust your training
and let's get this done.

660
00:34:50,753 --> 00:34:52,721
Check your comms, we'll meet at
the rally points in two minutes.

661
00:34:52,788 --> 00:34:55,056
Renee, I need to talk to you.

662
00:34:59,795 --> 00:35:01,997
I want you with me
on the assault team.

663
00:35:02,064 --> 00:35:03,398
I thought you wanted me
running ops.

664
00:35:03,466 --> 00:35:05,066
In order for this to work,

665
00:35:05,134 --> 00:35:07,369
I need every agent with
experience I can get.

666
00:35:07,436 --> 00:35:09,037
But you need to understand

667
00:35:09,105 --> 00:35:11,039
this goes against
every instinct I have.

668
00:35:11,107 --> 00:35:13,175
So you need to promise me
that you'll stay

669
00:35:13,242 --> 00:35:14,976
right behind me and you'll
do exactly as I say.

670
00:35:15,044 --> 00:35:17,012
Okay.

671
00:35:17,079 --> 00:35:20,315
- No, I need you to promise me.
- I promise.

672
00:35:20,383 --> 00:35:22,484
Get ready.

673
00:35:39,354 --> 00:35:41,015
Target A acquired.

674
00:35:41,016 --> 00:35:42,717
<i>B Target moving towards you.

675
00:35:42,785 --> 00:35:47,055
<i>20 feet... 10 feet...

676
00:35:47,122 --> 00:35:48,856
On my mark.

677
00:35:52,995 --> 00:35:54,796
Now.

678
00:35:56,498 --> 00:35:59,267
<i>Lookouts are down, you're clear.

679
00:35:59,335 --> 00:36:01,002
CTU, we're moving in
towards the building now.

680
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:02,170
<i>We see you, Jack.

681
00:36:02,237 --> 00:36:03,738
<i>It has become a tool

682
00:36:03,806 --> 00:36:05,473
<i>for truth-hiding,
misinformation

683
00:36:05,541 --> 00:36:06,774
<i>and propaganda for his regime.

684
00:36:26,895 --> 00:36:29,731
<i>..openly supports the masked

685
00:36:29,798 --> 00:36:31,966
<i>poisonous vipers of America.

686
00:36:37,239 --> 00:36:39,674
<i>This man is not
our President!

687
00:36:39,742 --> 00:36:41,943
<i>He's an arrogant pretender
who would sell our women

688
00:36:42,011 --> 00:36:43,144
<i>and children to the infidels

689
00:36:43,212 --> 00:36:44,712
<i>and the imperialists
of the West.

690
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:48,850
<i>His terrible crimes against our
people demand retribution!

691
00:36:48,917 --> 00:36:50,685
<i>We're not terrorists,

692
00:36:50,753 --> 00:36:54,055
<i>as President Taylor and her
other rats would label us.

693
00:36:56,525 --> 00:36:58,826
Don't move.

694
00:36:58,894 --> 00:37:00,395
Federal agent.
Get down on the ground now.

695
00:37:00,462 --> 00:37:01,863
Get down on the ground.

696
00:37:21,016 --> 00:37:24,485
Hastings, we just took a hostile
out on the second floor.

697
00:37:24,553 --> 00:37:25,987
Are we still good to go?

698
00:37:26,055 --> 00:37:27,321
Yes, Jack, you
are still good.

699
00:37:27,389 --> 00:37:30,124
Cover that, we need to move now.

700
00:37:30,192 --> 00:37:31,692
<i>...corruption and promiscuity
over our country

701
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,995
<i>and bringing back
foreign domination

702
00:37:34,063 --> 00:37:35,596
<i>over the Islamic Republic
of Kamistan.

703
00:37:35,664 --> 00:37:38,132
<i>This is the dog that we sent
to speak for our country.

704
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,134
<i>He's Taylor's puppet!

705
00:38:17,973 --> 00:38:20,308
<i>He who is guilty.

706
00:38:20,375 --> 00:38:22,009
That's it, Jack.

707
00:38:58,347 --> 00:38:59,981
It's all right.

708
00:39:00,048 --> 00:39:01,816
We're not here to hurt you.

709
00:39:04,887 --> 00:39:06,854
Where's your mommy and daddy?

710
00:39:08,223 --> 00:39:09,891
Federal agent!
Get on the ground now!

711
00:39:12,294 --> 00:39:14,095
One more word
and I will kill you.

712
00:39:17,966 --> 00:39:20,268
On the couch now.

713
00:39:22,004 --> 00:39:24,071
Jack, looks like Samir's
wrapping it up.

714
00:39:24,139 --> 00:39:25,506
You need to get
in there right now!

715
00:39:53,035 --> 00:39:56,270
<i>Taylor and her country want to
strip our nation of progress

716
00:39:56,338 --> 00:39:59,106
<i>and all defense capabilities.

717
00:39:59,174 --> 00:40:02,143
<i>She sees our great nation
rising together,

718
00:40:02,211 --> 00:40:05,012
<i>making strong advancement
in nuclear technology.

719
00:40:09,985 --> 00:40:13,754
<i>...so much that she
would charm Hassan

720
00:40:13,822 --> 00:40:15,289
<i>and make him
her subordinate.

721
00:40:15,357 --> 00:40:18,559
<i>And Hassan's own
greed-fueled lies and promises

722
00:40:18,627 --> 00:40:20,127
<i>that he never intended to keep.

723
00:40:20,195 --> 00:40:21,762
I have a visual on Hassan.

724
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:23,130
Ready to engage.

725
00:40:32,241 --> 00:40:36,777
<i>...you would do the same if
your homes were occupied.

726
00:40:36,845 --> 00:40:39,447
<i>We have thousands of volunteers
who have promised their service

727
00:40:39,514 --> 00:40:40,681
<i>and are willing
to give their lives.

728
00:40:40,749 --> 00:40:42,350
No...

729
00:40:42,417 --> 00:40:44,151
No!

730
00:40:44,219 --> 00:40:46,621
<i>All he sought to create

731
00:40:46,688 --> 00:40:49,624
<i>is a hollow, soulless nation.

732
00:40:53,996 --> 00:40:58,833
<i>You will soon hear the cry
to rise up and renew.

733
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:01,769
<i>We will take back our country.

734
00:41:01,837 --> 00:41:04,505
<i>Remember this day as the
beginning of a revolution.

735
00:41:06,341 --> 00:41:08,776
<i>It is the day we
eliminated a tyrant.

736
00:41:08,844 --> 00:41:11,312
<i>Hassan has torn us apart,
muzzled us, divided us

737
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:12,947
<i>with his condescending
peace treaty

738
00:41:13,015 --> 00:41:15,182
<i>of subjugation to the Americans.

739
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:20,688
<i>For this treachery,
the penalty is death.

740
00:41:20,756 --> 00:41:22,923
I'm sorry.

741
00:41:22,991 --> 00:41:27,828
<i>I will carry out
this sentence myself.

742
00:41:27,896 --> 00:41:31,666
<i>The time has come for this
criminal to pay for his treason.

743
00:41:36,705 --> 00:41:40,308
<i>Our country demands justice.

744
00:41:40,375 --> 00:41:44,645
<i>Omar Hassan shall pay
with his own blood.

745
00:41:45,714 --> 00:41:47,915
Oh!

746
00:41:47,983 --> 00:41:49,317
Oh...

747
00:41:49,384 --> 00:41:50,451
Jack.

748
00:41:50,519 --> 00:41:52,953
<i>Jack, talk to me.

749
00:41:53,021 --> 00:41:56,991
The, uh, statement
was prerecorded.

750
00:41:57,059 --> 00:41:59,860
He was dead before we got here.

751
00:42:14,876 --> 00:42:17,211
Oh...

752
00:42:19,715 --> 00:42:22,383
Oh.

753
00:42:26,321 --> 00:42:28,022
Call CTU.

754
00:42:28,090 --> 00:42:31,359
I want to know what
the hell went wrong.

755
00:42:31,426 --> 00:42:34,729
And clear the screens.

756
00:42:46,007 --> 00:42:48,509
We were too late.

757
00:42:48,577 --> 00:42:51,912
We weren't able to save him.

758
00:42:53,115 --> 00:42:54,382
I'm sorry.

759
00:42:54,449 --> 00:42:58,519
- No...!
- I'm sorry.

760
