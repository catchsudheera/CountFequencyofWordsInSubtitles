1
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:18,238
We have a problem. If that hard drive
is discovered by the Americans,

2
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,311
it'll jeopardize the next phase of our plan.

3
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,755
- <i>It's not here. </i>
- Keep looking.

4
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,910
Agent Drake?

5
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:28,712
Drop the weapon now!

6
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,471
- Jack's on the line.
- Jack, what is it?

7
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:36,074
I pulled data off a hard drive
in Anderson's apartment.

8
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,152
I believe Mitch Anderson's
trying to steal a Stealth fighter.

9
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,869
We have reason to believe a Stealth fighter
has been stolen by a terrorist.

10
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,316
- It's in your airspace as we speak.
- Just how sure are we about this?

11
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,517
<i>It's a near certainty, Mr President. </i>
<i>This is a Stealth aircraft. </i>

12
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,752
If he finds you, he may be on you
before your fighter escort can react.

13
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:59,394
Mitch Anderson, we know who you are,
we know what you're trying to do.

14
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,630
Captain Anderson? Captain Anderson?

15
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,439
We've been cut off.
Is there an override channel?

16
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:08,910
He cut off all communication circuits.
We can't do anything.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,831
Dad.

18
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,195
I'm scared.

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,879
<i> Air Force One has been fired on. </i>
<i>Repeat, Air Force One has been fired on. </i>

20
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,757
Oh, my God.

21
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,395
<i> Was Air Force One just hit?</i>

22
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,948
Was Air Force One just hit?

23
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,634
Escort pilots report...

24
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:37,110
Air Force One has suffered an indirect hit
by an air-to-air missile.

25
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,637
<i>Pieces are falling to the ground</i>
<i>over the desert. </i>

26
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,959
<i> This is Air Force One,</i>
<i>declaring an emergency. </i>

27
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,874
<i>Repeat, Air Force One</i>
<i>is declaring an emergency. </i>

28
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,349
<i> Copy. What is your condition? Over. </i>

29
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:01,115
<i> Extensive damage</i>
<i>to the portside wing and fuselage. </i>

30
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,193
<i>We've lost pressurisation. </i>
<i>Losing fuel pressure. Lower hydraulics... </i>

31
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,432
- Are those the coordinates?
- They're 20 nautical miles northeast of Indio.

32
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,478
Edgar, contact local PD and EMS.

33
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,869
- Alert them of the situation.
- On it.

34
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,872
Tony, do we have
any CTU support teams in the area?

35
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,952
The Las Vegas office
has two satellite teams available.

36
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,555
I'm gonna dispatch coordinates
to all teams in LA and Vegas

37
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,631
so they can start for the site now.

38
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,393
<i> Steady glide. </i>
<i>Left wing flaps damaged. </i>

39
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:35,271
Edgar, pull up satellite on the national park.
Pinpoint any possible landing scenarios.

40
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,032
Chloe, what's happening?

41
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,430
We've lost the signal.
They're moving and losing altitude.

42
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:43,034
Change the frequency.

43
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:51,478
- OK, I've got it.
- <i>... six knots. All engines are out. </i>

44
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,949
<i>Going through 7500 at 210 knots. </i>

45
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,877
<i> Roger, 210 knots. Sir... </i>

46
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:00,316
- Are you still reading coordinates?
- They're making the turn.

47
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:04,551
<i> Roger, I'm close to a stall. </i>
<i>We are putting her down. </i>

48
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:10,078
- <i>No gears deployed. We are still hard and fast. </i>
- <i> OK. Roger that, Air Force One. </i>

49
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:16,237
Air traffic control, this is CTU. We are sending
EMS, police, and rescue teams to the site.

50
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:22,156
- <i> Copy that, CTU.</i>
- <i> Descending through 5500, 160 knots. </i>

51
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:27,678
- Chloe, what's showing on radar?
- <i> We are on the deck. Going in. </i>

52
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,678
Chloe!

53
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,156
- Air Force One is down.
- <i> Air Force One?</i>

54
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,471
<i>Air Force One, do you read?</i>
<i>Air Force One is down. </i>

55
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,109
I got a confirm of scattered ground flashes
from the DOD satellite.

56
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,475
Edgar, bring that up.

57
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,590
- What's the status?
- It's down.

58
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:54,468
- What's its crash like?
- Rough. We don't know if there are survivors.

59
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,916
- Patch coordinates to all agencies.
Got it.

60
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,309
- Anybody try subchannel comm stat?
- No.

61
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:06,635
Secret Service has at least five personnel
on board. All of them have private channels.

62
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,669
- <i> Comm stat three, operator. </i>
- This is Bauer, password F-H-Ralphie-four.

63
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,151
- <i> Go ahead. </i>
- Flood AF1 with an acknowledge signal.

64
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,559
<i>Copy. </i>

65
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:21,428
<i>Comm stat three calling AF1</i>
<i>one through five, please acknowledge. </i>

66
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:24,990
<i>AF1 channels one through five,</i>
<i>please acknowledge. </i>

67
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,397
- <i> Channel three. </i>
- Who's this?

68
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:31,075
- <i> Patterson. We're down. </i>
- What is the status of the president?

69
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,355
<i> I don't know. I can't move. </i>

70
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,479
Agent Patterson, my name is Bauer,
I'm with CTU. Rescue units are en route.

71
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,994
What else can you tell me?

72
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,117
<i>I see some bodies. </i>
<i>I think we have some survivors. </i>

73
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,999
Mr Vice President,
I've just received confirmation.

74
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,390
Air Force One sustained a hit
from an air-to-air missile

75
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,550
fired from the stolen Stealth fighter.

76
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,518
- Is the president alive?
- We don't know at this time.

77
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,434
- When will we know?
- Hopefully within the next few minutes.

78
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,917
Charles.

79
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,508
We've known each other for 15 years.

80
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,955
If I can offer some advice?

81
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,429
Of course.

82
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,957
We all hope President Keeler is alive,
but even if he is,

83
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:31,589
it's very likely he won't be
in any shape to run the country.

84
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,390
You need to make arrangements
to be sworn in to office as soon as possible,

85
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:40,234
and the media should provide live coverage.

86
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:45,917
The American people need to be reassured
that their leadership is intact.

87
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,879
That's good advice, Mike.
I'll take it under consideration, but...

88
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,599
I don't want to act prematurely.

89
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,750
I understand.

90
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,352
Well, we have to get to the White House.

91
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,718
I've arranged for a security briefing
with the Pentagon.

92
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,155
That's good.

93
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:17,153
By now you all know
Air Force One has been shot down.

94
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:22,030
One of the pilots following Air Force One
managed to get a visual of the fighter used.

95
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:25,078
Pilot engaged and shot down the Stealth.

96
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:28,197
The status of the president
is unclear at this time.

97
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:32,076
Rescue teams are minutes away.
We'll know very soon.

98
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:37,757
The man responsible for what has transpired
today, Habib Marwan, is still out there,

99
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,956
and likely planning further attacks.

100
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:44,318
I want every one of you
to rededicate yourselves to finding Marwan.

101
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:49,599
I don't want a single lead ignored,
or shred of evidence missed.

102
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,319
Let's get back to work.

103
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,079
Michelle, let me talk to you.

104
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,556
Uplink leads to a station
so we can start work on a priority list.

105
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:04,713
We might not know exactly where Marwan is,
but he has to be in a 50 mile radius...

106
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,554
Jack, I'm sorry, I just got off the phone
with the secretary of defense,

107
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,915
and there's a higher priority than Marwan.

108
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,275
- What?
- Recovering the nuclear football.

109
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,280
- Didn't it go down with Air Force One?
- Not exactly.

110
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,636
The missile inflicted enough damage
that it left debris.

111
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,280
A lot was sucked out,
including the football.

112
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,636
There's a transponder in the casing
so we know its location.

113
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,439
Then the retrieval team
should have no problem.

114
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,715
The secretary wants you to head that team.

115
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,075
- Why?
- It's his top priority.

116
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:37,233
That case contains the codes and locations
of our entire nuclear arsenal.

117
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:41,711
Nothing is more critical than getting it back,
and as quickly as possible.

118
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,994
Fine.

119
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,516
- I'll organise your team, mobilise the units.
- Thanks.

120
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:52,072
- What's the location of the football?
- 40 miles northeast of here, in the desert.

121
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,631
Hey! Hey.

122
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,913
What's wrong? What else is happening?

123
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,991
Paul may have to go back into surgery.

124
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:09,471
Apparently the bullet
did more damage than they thought.

125
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,629
Sorry.

126
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,917
If I had handled things differently,
if I had trusted him...

127
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,514
Audrey, you are not responsible for this.

128
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:20,275
I, and I alone,
made the decision on how to handle Paul.

129
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:24,194
If you want to remain effective,
to be able to do your job,

130
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,555
you have to let it go.

131
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:31,270
Jack, that's your gift.
You're able to block things out.

132
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,510
I can't do that.

133
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,398
Jack, the chopper's waiting.

134
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,915
- I have to change and get ready.
- All right.

135
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,396
Honey?

136
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,552
What's wrong?

137
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:05,156
I don't know. Something woke me. It sounded
like some kind of explosion or something.

138
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,674
Explosion? Nearby?

139
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,591
I'm not sure.

140
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,269
- It was probably just a bad dream.
- Yeah.

141
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,794
You're still stressed, aren't you?

142
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,839
I want you to try and forget about work, OK?

143
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,992
Just focus on what we came out here for.

144
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,355
To relax,

145
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:35,273
and to make a baby.

146
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,320
Look.
- What?

147
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,035
- Watch your step.
- OK.

148
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,711
Oh, my God.

149
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,199
Kelly!

150
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,995
What is it?

151
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:06,278
If the president is unable to fulfil his duties,
Vice President Logan will assume office.

152
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:10,194
- Cabinet will need to be briefed on the crash.
- I'll take care of it.

153
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:14,910
Not all members are equal. State and Defense
need more detail than, say, agriculture.

154
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,150
Yeah, I can handle it.

155
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:22,951
- I want to make sure the transition is smooth.
- I understand, but I do know what to do.

156
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,471
All right.

157
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,639
Tony.

158
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:37,199
I've noticed a little hostility on your part.
If it's because of me and Michelle...

159
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,077
It's none of my business.

160
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:44,548
And as far as the hostility goes,
I can promise you it's over with.

161
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,438
Whatever you say. One more thing.

162
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,111
I think the world of Michelle.
Loved working with her.

163
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,397
Outside work, we never got off the ground.

164
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:59,871
She never said why, but it didn't take a genius
to figure it out. She cared about you.

165
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,190
If you ask me, she still does.

166
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:06,558
Mr Buchanan,
rescue teams are inside Air Force One.

167
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,799
We're picking up a live feed now.

168
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,359
<i> There's damage</i>
<i>to the fuselage and hatch. </i>

169
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,557
<i>Go and check... check to see if he's alive. </i>

170
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,078
<i>Check him. See if he's alive. </i>

171
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,958
<i>Got a body here. She's dead too. </i>

172
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:35,077
<i> The president</i>
<i>was in the conference room. </i>

173
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,515
<i> Copy. </i>
<i>He was in the conference room. </i>

174
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,160
- <i> What?</i>
- <i> Got a survivor!</i>

175
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,312
<i> I'm going in. Keep close. </i>

176
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,030
<i>Looks like the president's son. </i>

177
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,553
<i>He's dead. </i>

178
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:55,155
- <i>Where's the president?</i>
- <i> This may be him. </i>

179
00:12:55,240 --> 00:13:00,519
- <i> Wait, hold on. This may be him. </i>
- <i> It's the president. </i>

180
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,559
<i>He's still alive. I repeat, the president is alive. </i>

181
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:09,077
<i>We need medevac teams in here ASAP. Do</i>
<i>you read that? We need medevac teams here. </i>

182
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,270
- Novick.
- <i> I have Buchanan. </i>

183
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,318
Yes, he's right here. Bill Buchanan.

184
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,590
- Bill.
- Mr Vice President.

185
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:26,468
I'm in direct contact with the teams
at the crash site of Air Force One.

186
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,120
President Keeler is alive.

187
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,074
- Thank God.
- <i>Yes, sir. </i>

188
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:38,835
But he's in critical condition.
He's unconscious, he's lost blood,

189
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:42,515
there's no chance he'll be able
to lead this country, not for days,

190
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,319
and probably much longer.

191
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,354
- <i>Mr Vice President?</i>
- Yes, I'm here.

192
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,359
This is all confirmed?

193
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,149
The president is being medevacked
to the emergency centre as we speak.

194
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:58,198
Sir, I recommend
you invoke the 25th Amendment

195
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,999
and take control of things
as soon as possible.

196
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,798
I understand.

197
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,510
Thank you, Bill.

198
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,868
Keeler's alive, but he's incapacitated.

199
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,872
We should probably
contact the cabinet members.

200
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:20,876
Actually, I've already put that in motion. Most
are standing by, the others will be very soon.

201
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,794
- You did that without my permission?
- You had enough to worry about.

202
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,758
I thought it best to be prepared.

203
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,519
Yes.

204
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,874
All right.

205
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,788
Thank you.

206
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,952
Shall I begin the process of collecting votes?

207
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,031
Yes, go ahead.

208
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,196
I can't get a signal.

209
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,191
Try up here.

210
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,558
- Got it.
- Kelly, look at this.

211
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:15,275
- What is it?
- I'm not sure, but if it's what I think it is...

212
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:22,469
I read this article, it's a funny name... I can't
remember, but it's got our nuclear codes.

213
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,439
It goes everywhere the president goes.
He can launch an attack from it.

214
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:29,353
- We gotta call somebody.
- Who are you gonna call?

215
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,908
I'll start with the police, I guess.

216
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,673
They'll put us through to the right people.

217
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,757
The football transponder's
signal's still strong.

218
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,189
- Hello?
- <i> Hey, it's me. </i>

219
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,635
- Hey.
- When I walked away from you at CTU,

220
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,757
I felt like you didn't understand
what I was trying to say.

221
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:58,549
<i>I'm not telling you that you shouldn't care. </i>

222
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,953
I care.

223
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,235
I care about you,

224
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:06,312
I care about what happened to Paul.
I feel responsible.

225
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:10,359
But this country is under attack.
I've got a job to do. I don't have a choice.

226
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,955
Jack, I understand
what you have to do is very important.

227
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,713
I just didn't want us to leave things like that.

228
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,270
I'm glad. Me neither.

229
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:25,838
- Hold on a second. I gotta take this call.
- Wait, Jack. Take the call, all right?

230
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,310
Stay focused on what you have to do.

231
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:33,075
- Yeah, I'll talk to you in a little while. Bye.
- <i>OK.</i>

232
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,276
- This is Bauer.
- Jack, it's Tony.

233
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,273
I got a guy the police put through.
He's in the desert, says he found a case.

234
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,638
- Jack, this guy found the football.
- OK, let me speak to him.

235
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:48,032
His name's Jason Gerard. We're running
a check. I'm patching him through now.

236
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,998
OK, Tony, stay on the other line.

237
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,198
- Mr Gerard?
- Call me Jason. I'm with my wife, Kelly.

238
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:00,955
My name is Jack Bauer.
I'm an agent with the Department of Defense.

239
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,555
My colleague says you found
what we refer to as the football.

240
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,996
It looks that way.
I don't know much about this sort of thing.

241
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:12,437
- My wife and I are here on a camping trip.
- Why don't you describe what you found?

242
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:17,992
Sure. It's a black leather briefcase, it's got
a number panelling over by the handle.

243
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:20,640
It was in a case
with the presidential seal on it.

244
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,838
That sounds like it. Right now I'm
in a helicopter. I'm about 20 minutes away.

245
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:28,629
Look, I just want you
to hang out there and wait for me.

246
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,871
I think someone beat you to the punch.
I see headlights.

247
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:36,238
- How far away?
- It's hard to tell. A few miles.

248
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,834
OK, just hold on a second, Jason.

249
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:42,276
Tony, this kid says
he's got headlights headed towards him.

250
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,318
- Do we have any ground units in his vicinity?
- No.

251
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,992
Highway patrol, park rangers?

252
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,036
- No.
- How can that be?

253
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:53,955
We're spread thin, Jack. All state agencies
are still assisting with the evacuation.

254
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:58,318
- Jason, are the headlights headed for you?
- Yeah, they're coming this way.

255
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,790
Dammit! This situation
just got a lot more complicated.

256
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,755
- What do you mean?
- The football has a transponder.

257
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:10,311
It allows anyone to pinpoint its location,
as long as they've got the frequency.

258
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,994
You think someone's got it
who's not supposed to.

259
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,992
- We have to make that assumption.
- Who do you think it is?

260
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,675
The terrorists who carried out today's attacks.
We don't have time.

261
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:25,232
Remove the transponder and take the football
and get away from there as far as you can.

262
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,719
All right.

263
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,360
Flashlight. I need your light.

264
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,237
OK, go ahead.

265
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:34,039
The transponder's tiny
and it's hidden in the case.

266
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,953
- It's designed not to be found.
- How will I find it?

267
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,838
- <i>Do you have a compass and a flashlight?</i>
- Uh, yeah.

268
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,148
- Get the compass.
- OK.

269
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:45,028
<i>OK. I want you to move the compass</i>
<i>over the surface of the case, slowly. </i>

270
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:50,035
The transponder puts out an electromagnetic
field. It should move the needle.

271
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:53,999
Just move the compass over
the surface of the case and watch the needle.

272
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,513
Here, here, here, here.

273
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,034
- Keep the beam on the compass.
- OK.

274
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,115
I think I got it. I found it. I found it.

275
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:27,548
OK, good. Take a knife or a sharp rock
and start scratching the surface, hard.

276
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,750
- Hurry.
- Dammit!

277
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:34,198
- Jason, they're coming.
- Come on, Jason. Talk to me.

278
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,953
I am working on it.

279
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,678
OK. I think I got it.

280
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:44,356
OK. Take the compass, put it over the scraped
area and tell me, is the needle moving?

281
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:48,752
- No. No, it's not.
- You've disabled it. How far is the vehicle?

282
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,991
- Not far.
- OK. Take the football and start moving.

283
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,675
I don't care which direction,
start moving now. I'll get back to you.

284
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,194
We gotta go. We gotta go now!

285
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:03,430
Tony, I'm going to need surveillance
of the entire area put up to my screen.

286
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:17,592
Why are we stopping?
- We've lost the signal.

287
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,911
- How is that possible?
- Maybe it was damaged on impact.

288
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:26,115
And it just happens to malfunction
now that we're getting closer?

289
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,869
Scan the area for cellphones.

290
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,793
Active and passive signals.

291
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,519
- Yeah?
- <i> Jason. </i>

292
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,592
We found a reserve power station
half a mile north of you.

293
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:46,229
- That's right. I remember it from the map.
- I want you to go there.

294
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,279
- OK, yeah. We'll get there.
- The station's a large, unmanned facility.

295
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:54,831
I want you to break in and hide. Avoid using
your flashlight, and as soon as you hang up,

296
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,878
- take your cell batteries out.
- The batteries?

297
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:02,795
It'll prevent passive triangulation. In other
words, it'll stop you from being followed.

298
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:07,954
- What if I need to contact you?
- Put them back in, but only if you have to.

299
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,873
I'm gonna give you my direct line.
Have you got a pen?

300
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,714
- Yeah. Hold on. Go ahead.
- 310...

301
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,268
597-3781.

302
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,669
"781." OK, yeah, I got it.

303
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,672
- Start moving now!
- <i>OK.</i>

304
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:27,231
He said to take the battery
out of the cellphone. Come on. Come on.

305
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:34,078
I had a cellphone signal for a few seconds.
It was moving, but it's gone now.

306
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:37,470
- Did it move enough to yield a vector?
- Wait.

307
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:41,314
Yes. It was headed a few degrees
west of north just before it cut out.

308
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:45,598
Check the map.
See if there's anything near there.

309
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:49,149
There's a reserve power plant.

310
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:52,038
A kilometre away, maybe less.

311
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:58,199
Whoever has the football,
that's where they're heading.

312
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,593
This is it.

313
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,675
Stay back.

314
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,712
We're not in any danger, right? I mean, how
could anyone even know that we're here?

315
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:50,113
We're just being safe. A nice,
relaxing weekend in the desert, just like I said.

316
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,156
They're here. I gotta call Jack.

317
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,071
Come on.

318
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:12,195
- This is Bauer.
- It's Jason. These terrorists, they're here.

319
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,998
- How many?
- I just saw two Jeeps.

320
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,152
- Where are you?
- Inside the plant. When will you get here?

321
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:21,791
- Soon. Just stand by.
- Go, baby. Go! Come on. Just keep moving.

322
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:25,793
Tony, it's Jack. We're out of time.
We need schematics for the plant now.

323
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:29,668
Yeah, it should be on your screen
in a few seconds.

324
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,116
OK, I got it. Thanks.

325
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,714
- Jason, are you still with me?
- I'm with you.

326
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:39,839
- <i>Which side of the building did you enter?</i>
- Uh, the south side.

327
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:44,710
This is a large facility. I want you
to go to the lower level, southeast corner.

328
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:49,715
- I'll find you there as soon as we land.
- OK. Hey, Agent Bauer? Please hurry.

329
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,153
We are.

330
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,990
Find them.

331
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,710
There's got to be stairs somewhere.
Come on.

332
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:35,157
- There. There they are.
- Wait. What if it's a dead end?

333
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,155
Keep going!

334
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,632
- A man and a woman.
- Where?

335
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,790
This way.

336
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,512
They went down here.

337
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:57,079
Follow them and flush them out.
Go around and cut off the exits.

338
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,914
Come on. Keep going.

339
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,117
Come on. Go up there. Go up there. Go on!

340
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,471
- Come on. Come on, come on, come on!
- OK.

341
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,753
- Anything?
- Nothing.

342
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,151
Helicopter.

343
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,038
- Intercept it.
- Yes, sir.

344
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,909
Jason.

345
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,958
- Where are you?
- We've just landed. Where are you?

346
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,156
Inside the plant, on the lower level.

347
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,317
Jack. Jack!

348
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,158
- Are you there?
- <i>I'm here. </i>

349
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:38,550
They're inside.
We cannot keep hiding, they're gonna find us.

350
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,030
I know. You gotta keep moving.
I'll get right back to you.

351
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,958
- Stiles.
- It's Jack. I need to speak to Audrey, now!

352
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,157
- <i>Ms Raines, Jack's on line one. </i>
- Jack.

353
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:00,233
I'm taking fire. The other agent's dead.
I need the code for the football.

354
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,548
All right, hang on.

355
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:11,518
Just take the football.
Take the football. Come on!

356
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,479
Come on!

357
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:41,511
- Jack, *76114.
- I got it.

358
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,508
- Hey.
- <i> Jason. </i>

359
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:54,594
I need you to open the case.
The combination is *76114.

360
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:58,639
- Why? What is the point of this?
- Just do it. *76114.

361
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:04,670
He wants us to open the briefcase. *76114.

362
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,713
- OK, it's open.
- <i>OK.</i>

363
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:11,190
Inside should be a phone,
a control board, and the playbook.

364
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:14,477
I want you to remove the book,
give the case back to your wife.

365
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,278
The two need to stay separate.

366
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:19,989
- Why?
- The board is useless without the playbook.

367
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,911
I need you to split up.

368
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,072
- He wants us to split up.
- I can hear him.

369
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,720
- I am not leaving my wife.
- You have to.

370
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,268
- Forget it.
- Jason, please. Listen to me.

371
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:34,433
I know how scared you are, but if he gets
what he wants, he'll kill both of you.

372
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:40,231
Right now, the only chance you have
to survive is to separate. Do you understand?

373
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:45,959
It's OK, Jason. He's kept us alive this far.
Let's just do what he says.

374
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,589
- Just get here as fast as you can.
- I will.

375
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:03,751
I love you.

376
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:07,638
Give me the backpack.

377
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,075
Listen.

378
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,875
- Here, you take the phone.
- OK.

379
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:18,033
I want you to go to that top level there,
all right? I'm going to stay down here.

380
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:21,396
- You just find a place to hide, all right?
- OK.

381
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,310
Go, go, go. Go! Go! Go! Hide! Hide!

382
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,639
Hey!

383
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,159
I've got him.

384
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,830
He's clean.

385
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:22,955
- Where's the control board?
- I don't know what you're talking...

386
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:38,750
- Tell me what I want to know.
- I swear, I don't know. Please.

387
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:59,111
It doesn't have to be this painful.

388
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,189
Bauer.

389
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:11,556
- They got my husband.
- Where are you? I'm on the lower level.

390
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:15,428
We had to leave. We're on the second floor.
I don't know where.

391
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:18,114
- OK, I'm on my way.
- They're gonna kill him.

392
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,839
Kelly, stay on the phone. Keep talking to me.

393
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:23,593
- I can't.
- Kelly!

394
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:26,638
- Oh, please!
- Where is the control board?

395
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,478
Stop!

396
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,716
I have what you want.

397
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:41,315
- Give it to me.
- First you let my husband go.

398
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,911
No!

399
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,832
OK.

400
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,553
OK.

401
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,950
I'll give it to you if you promise not to kill us.

402
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:07,079
I won't kill you. I promise.

403
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,869
It's over there.

404
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,030
It's behind the pillar.

405
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:30,277
- It's locked.
- What is the code?

406
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:37,117
It's, uh... star 7-6-1-1-4.

407
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:46,472
It's here.

408
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,520
Let's go.

409
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:54,229
OK. It's OK.

410
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,117
Kill them.

411
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,715
No!

412
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:13,599
This is Jack Bauer, I need a medic.
Second level, north end of the building.

413
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,194
<i> On our way there now. </i>

414
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:20,512
It's all right. He's gonna be OK.
Help is on the way. Where is the football?

415
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:25,355
They have it.
They went out that door. I'm sorry.

416
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,034
Don't be. You did great. Thank you.

417
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:30,588
Air support, two hostiles left the building.

418
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:34,832
I do not have possession of the football.
Repeat, I do not have the football.

419
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:04,279
Air support, football is in the lead Jeep,
headed north. Take it out.

420
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,316
I repeat, take it out.

421
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:34,669
Put your hands where I can see them.

422
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:55,637
Air support, I cannot see the football
in the vehicle. Shine your spotlight on me.

423
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:58,188
And follow.

424
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:18,190
Air support, I'm in possession of the football.
Go after the other Jeep.

425
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,874
- Almeida.
- <i>It's Jack. I've got the football. </i>

426
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:37,919
Three hostiles down, one escaped.
I'm not positive, but I think it was Marwan.

427
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,230
I'm sorry, but I had to make a choice.

428
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,949
Marwan gave us the football
to buy his freedom?

429
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:47,191
- Yeah, that doesn't sound right.
- What are you thinking?

430
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,429
I don't know.

431
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:51,637
Let me ask you something.
Is anything missing?

432
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:54,075
No. All the components are here.

433
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,355
Hold on one second.

434
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,031
I was wrong. There are pages missing.

435
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:13,157
Look, the sections are colour-coded.
What's missing?

436
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:15,356
Red chapter, section three.

437
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:18,671
- Get Audrey.
- All right. We'll call you right back.

438
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,992
- All right, take care of it.
- Yes, sir.

439
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:34,198
You're worried about him.

440
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:39,199
I am. He seems unsure of himself.

441
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:42,795
Oh, Mike, trust me.
He's spent his whole life preparing for this.

442
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:47,271
He's just being cautious,
feeling his way along. He'll be fine.

443
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:52,400
- Yeah.
- <i> The call came in, all in favour. </i>

444
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,074
All right, thanks.

445
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:59,039
The vote was unanimous. The 25th
Amendment's been officially invoked.

446
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:02,829
Tell the press we're ready. Let's get this done.

447
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:06,117
Mr Vice President,
the 25th Amendment is in effect.

448
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,952
- Any dissenting votes?
- None.

449
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:10,190
We should proceed with the swearing in.

450
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:14,034
Yes. The ceremony will take a minute,
then you can address the nation.

451
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:17,715
I'm still not certain a live address
makes sense this time of night.

452
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:21,190
After what's happened,
an aawul lot of people are wide awake.

453
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:24,033
I'm sure they'd like to hear from you directly.

454
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,712
Yes, of course.

455
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,438
We're ready, sir.

456
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:52,509
Please. Please.

457
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:55,114
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.

458
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:58,075
- Yeah.
- <i> Jack, it's Tony. </i>

459
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,435
- Is Audrey there?
- Jack, I'm here.

460
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,636
<i>Tell me the contents of the pages. </i>

461
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:06,633
It's the section which contains
warhead locations and activation codes.

462
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:10,110
We started cancelling codes
as soon as Air Force One went down.

463
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:13,397
But there are thousands of warheads.
It's gonna take an hour.

464
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:17,268
In the meantime, if they get ahold
of a warhead and a matching code,

465
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,237
we will not be able to stop them.

466
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:22,392
Copy that. I'll get back to you.

467
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,673
- <i> Mr Novick's office. </i>
- Let me speak to Novick.

468
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,512
<i>Yes, sir. Right away. </i>

469
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:38,832
I solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute
the office of the president,

470
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:41,309
and will, to the best of my ability,

471
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:46,838
preserve, protect and defend
the constitution of the United States.

472
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:49,470
Mr President, I appreciate it.

473
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:54,439
I appreciate you coming.

474
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,238
- As most of you know...
- Novick.

475
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,197
<i>Mike, it's Jack. We got a problem. </i>

476
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:02,319
...this oath under tragic circumstances.
Words cannot express the sense...

477
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,914
<i>The football's been compromised. </i>

478
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,116
Yes, I'll tell him.

479
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:11,910
...due to injuries sustained during the crash.
He is in our prayers, as well as our hearts.

480
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,638
Mr President.

481
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:17,395
- I've just received a phone call from CTU.
- Yes?

482
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:21,075
I'm sorry, sir, but it appears
at least part of the nuclear football

483
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:24,118
has fallen into the hands of terrorists.

484
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:00,631
