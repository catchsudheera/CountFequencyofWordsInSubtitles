4
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:12,210
*******

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:14,570
Have you made the preparations?

6
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:16,080
Are you sure you want  to leave now,colonel?

7
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,120
Can't imagine general juma will be pleased to learn

8
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,470
that you're abandoning your mission.

9
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:20,790
The mission is over.

10
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:22,640
You think I'm a fool,mr.Burnett?

11
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,870
If anything should happen to me on my way out of the country,

12
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:27,810
the data file with all the names and bank transactions of all those involved

13
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:30,420
will be sent to the justice dertment.

14
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,700
When the car arrives,we would like you to go with the driver

15
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,600
so that we could follow you back to dubaku.

16
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,520
You want her to go to him and face him?

17
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,550
It's the only chance we have of finding him before he disappears forever.

18
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:40,410
I'll do it.

19
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:42,290
You keep her safe,you hear me?

20
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:44,650
We will.

21
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:46,770
Colonel!

22
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:49,110
Fbi.Go!Go!

23
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:01,050
I want the names of everyone in the united states government

24
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:02,530
that you've been working with.

25
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:03,530
I have a list.

26
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:06,490
I found some kind of digital storage device implanted under dubaku's skin.

27
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:08,340
Can you upload the files to fbi?

28
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:10,680
Marika didn't make it.

29
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,640
You killed my sister.

30
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,290
I'm so sorry.

31
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:14,490
What do you want from me?!

32
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:16,280
I just want to know that you feel something.

33
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,450
I want to know that you feel the same kind of pain that I do!

34
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:22,080
Do you feel that?!

35
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:26,180
I'm working with fbi to coordinate an interagency sweep.

36
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:27,870
We should start making arrests within the hour.

37
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:30,840
What you have done here today puts all of us in your debt.

38
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,340
There are a lot of people to thank,including jack bauer.

39
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:35,640
What are you asking me to do,bill?

40
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,370
I'm asking you to speak  to senator mayer.

41
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:39,530
Jack bauer helped save this country.

42
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:42,330
He doesn't deserve to spend the rest of his life in prison.

43
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:43,700
-I'm going to the white house.
-Sir?

44
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:46,760
President taylor wants to speak to me regarding jack bauer.

45
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,130
Grab your laptop,ryan.

46
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:50,000
I want you there with me.

47
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,390
There's gonna be another attack.

48
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:55,880
Here in D.C.My source tells me that the window opens at 1900 hours.

49
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,840
What's the target?

50
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,370
He doesn't know  the exact target,

51
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:03,100
but it's definitely going to be of high value and high impact.

52
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:05,420
He gave me the name of somebody who's been involved in the planning.

53
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:06,850
-Who?
-Ryan burnett.

54
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:08,300
Senator mayer's chief of staff.

55
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,170
That's right.

56
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:12,980
***********

57
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,050
hold on a second.

58
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,860
Go ahead.

59
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:44,290
icu.

60
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:45,760
One moment,please.

61
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,560
Corinna,you got a call on three.

62
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,860
-Who is it?
-Dr.May.He's got a question.

63
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,930
Doctors are so helpless.

64
00:02:55,930 --> 00:03:00,520
Dr. May? Hello?

65
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:03,280
There was no one there.

66
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,160
If he calls back,tell him I'll call him back in a minute.

67
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:12,360
code blue.Code blue!

68
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,190
We have a code blue in the icu!

69
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:17,240
Get agent walker down to icu now!

70
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:24,810
Swift and decisive  is how the pentagon describes  the U.S.Invasion  now underway in sangala.

71
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:27,400
"Sporadic resistance,minimal casualties.

72
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:33,430
"  This in direct contrast  to assertions made  by sangalese leader  benjamin juma  on state-supported television.

73
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:38,920
Our brave soldiers are beating back the enemy all across sangala city.

74
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:42,180
History is on our side,my friends.

75
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:48,440
We survived their slave ships,and we will survive their warships,too.

76
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:51,340
Declaring victory while his own troops are fleeing the capital,

77
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,650
and his palace lies in ruins.

78
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,880
When do we think this was made?

79
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:59,530
My guess is these recordings were made some time before the invasion,ma'am.

80
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,180
Which begs the question,john.

81
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:03,250
Where is h and why haven't we found him yet?

82
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:07,850
Special forces teams all over sangala city are searing for him.

83
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:11,150
There is some intelligence to suggest he may have fled the country.

84
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:15,070
Admiral smith,you and i both know that juma must be captured.

85
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:18,040
He must be tried and convicted of his crimes against humanity.

86
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,130
Otherwise,we've as good as failed.

87
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:21,750
He can't go far,ma'am.

88
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,520
No country on earth will grant him asylum.

89
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,440
Then find him,admiral smith.

90
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:29,240
Wherever he is.

91
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:35,180
General juma?

92
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:38,170
Beautiful,isn't it?

93
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:39,540
Sir?

94
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,770
It's not a trick question,laurent.

95
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:43,670
It is beautiful.

96
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:46,360
Why not?

97
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,320
It is almost time.

98
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,500
The men-- are they ready?

99
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,110
Yes,sir.

100
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:54,830
Are they afraid?

101
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:59,880
I don't know,sir,but some of them are praying.

102
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:02,830
It's good if they are afraid.

103
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:06,200
It means they will fight bravely.

104
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,580
Have you heard from my father yet,sir?

105
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:11,820
I thought he was supposed to be meeting us here.

106
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,830
Don't worry,laurent.

107
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:16,010
He will be here.

108
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:17,900
Yes,sir.

109
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,690
Colonel dubaku is dead.

110
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:27,530
Are you certain?

111
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:29,380
The dose I administered was catastrophic.

112
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:31,530
His son just asked me about him.

113
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:36,490
He must never know about this,or about his father's cowardice.

114
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:37,170
He won'T.

115
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,490
Then nothing will stand in our way,udo.

116
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:42,390
But hurry.The attack window is narrowing.

117
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:44,370
The timing must be precise.

118
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:46,430
-Doctor: Clear!
-Yes,sir.

119
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:51,560
Clear.

120
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,340
One more time at 360.

121
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:57,360
clear.

122
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:00,090
Nothing.

123
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:03,200
Going again,doctor?

124
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:05,960
no.

125
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,890
That's it,everybody.I'm calling it.

126
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:10,350
Time of death: 6:06 P.M.

127
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:11,690
Drstahl,what's going on?

128
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:12,860
A massive heart attack.

129
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,580
You said that he was stable,that he was going to be okay.

130
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:15,510
So,what happened?

131
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:16,610
I'm not sure.

132
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:18,180
Maybe a preexisting condition.

133
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:21,770
The autopsy will tell us.Excuse me.

134
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:28,020
The wide extent of the corruption requires a coordinated approach.

135
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,640
We know the government's been compromised.

136
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,660
We just don't know at what level.

137
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:34,910
Presently,chloe o'brian is vetting the names department by department.

138
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:38,610
I'm prioritizing secret service,so the president is secured as soon as possible.

139
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:40,840
Team leaders will then receive their assignmes--

140
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,610
defense,treasury,state,et cetera--

141
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:46,750
and make their arrests contemporaneously across the district.

142
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:52,890
-o'brian.
-Chloe,it's jack.

143
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:55,830
Have the names from dubaku's database been handed over to the arrest teams yet?

144
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:56,560
Not yet.

145
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,420
Okay,listen to me.

146
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:00,050
I've just learned that juma's operatives are planning another attack.

147
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:01,850
Jack,they're telling us here it's over.

148
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:02,700
That's wrong.

149
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,030
Tony's my source on the intel.

150
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:05,150
Do you know what the target is?

151
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:06,870
Only that it's high value,high casualty,

152
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:08,890
and that it's happening now,which is why I need your help.

153
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:11,720
There's a man on the list,a ryan burnett.

154
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,400
He's senator mayer's chief of staff.

155
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,190
Mayer?

156
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:16,730
Isn't he the guy who grilled you this morning at the senate subcommittee hearing?

157
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:18,850
Yeah,but the senator's not implicated in the conspiracy.

158
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:22,580
But burnett has been providing support for juma and dubaku all along.

159
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,700
Chloe,I need you to delete his name from the list.

160
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,530
What?Why?

161
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:28,630
If the fbi start to move in on him,he'll lawyer up,

162
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:30,770
and no one will get the information on time.

163
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:32,000
Where is he now?

164
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,050
Jack: He's at the white house with the senator.

165
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:34,390
They've got a meeting with the president.

166
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:36,340
I'm on my way there now to be debriefed by bill.

167
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:37,710
I'll take care of him then.

168
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:41,150
Jack,you don't expect to interrogate a suspect in the white house?

169
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:42,030
Let me handle that.

170
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:43,790
Chloe,just get his name deleted from the list.

171
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:45,850
I'll get back to you.

172
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:48,430
She's in.

173
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:28,100
How close are we?

174
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,020
Close.

175
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:30,230
Is there anything I can do to help?

176
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:32,560
I'm just cycling through the last layer of data now.

177
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,470
You know,it might be quicker

178
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:37,200
if you send the subsets to my station one by one.

179
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:37,990
Good idea.

180
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:41,410
And then that way I can get to work on distributing them.

181
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:45,780
-Okay,then.
-Thank you.

182
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:03,110
Listen,jack,ybe you should reconsider.

183
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:05,480
Reconsider what?

184
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,460
Taking bill into your confidence.

185
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:13,230
Look,I mean,he's been a part of this operation since the get-go.

186
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:15,200
I don't know what it's going to take to get burnett to talk.

187
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,750
If I have to use extreme measures...

188
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:20,950
I don't get it.What,you don't think he'll go there?

189
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:23,140
I'm driving off a cliff here,tony.

190
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:26,990
I don't need to put bill in the passenger seat.

191
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:30,010
All right,then,fine.I'll go with you.

192
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:31,200
You're a wanted felon.

193
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,630
You wouldn't get past the first checkpoint.

194
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:35,890
Besides,with all of the government agencies still compromised,

195
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:40,030
it might be up to you to stop the attack.

196
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:44,920
See you on the other side.

197
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:53,850
Yes?

198
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:55,430
Can you extend the attack window?

199
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:58,110
Not without risking the entire operation.

200
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:58,960
Why?

201
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,620
There's been a complication.

202
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:03,490
I may be stuck here longer than I anticipated.

203
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:05,580
I'll call you back.

204
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:06,680
Mr.Kanin.

205
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,720
Ryan burnett,senator mayer's chief of staff.

206
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,180
We've spoken on the phone.

207
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:12,120
Many times.It's good to finally meet you.

208
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:15,470
Likewise.The senator's inside.Right this way.

209
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,920
Senator?

210
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:26,320
Well,senator,I see you've found the bar.

211
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,250
Mind if I join you?

212
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:32,980
Something I never knew.

213
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:36,030
If it ain't from kentucky,you can't call it bourbon.

214
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:38,370
Spare me the southern gentleman routine,ethan.

215
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:40,520
The president didn't call me up here at the ass-end of the day

216
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,940
to drink her booze and flip through a briefing book.

217
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:46,170
I thought it might be helpful,before your meeting,

218
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:48,680
to bring you up to speed on the events of the last ten hours.

219
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,860
Okay.

220
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,980
I'm up to speed.

221
00:10:55,020 --> 00:11:00,140
Senator,surely you have some reaction to what you just read.

222
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:02,220
Damn right I have a reaction.

223
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,870
I want to know what all this has to do with jack bauer.

224
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:07,130
I mean,that's the reason I'm here,right?

225
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:10,440
Without mr.Bauer,we would never have uncovered the conspiracy

226
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,260
in the first place nor the people behind it.

227
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:15,860
His efforts,in conjunction with those of the fbi,

228
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:19,880
are largely responsible for the arrests being made right now across the district.

229
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:24,620
You're not saying that he's acting in an official capacity?

230
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,730
I don't have to tell you how this looks,ethan.

231
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:31,020
Colluding with a rogue operative from a disbanded agency.

232
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,410
I'm sorry you see it that way.

233
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:33,910
How else am I supposed to see it?

234
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:37,740
The way the president does-- that jack bauer saved lives today,

235
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:42,800
plain and simple,including her husband'S.

236
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,840
Look,senator,I know this isn't easy for you.

237
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,410
The public battle you've waged against detainee abuse

238
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:49,750
and human rights violations...

239
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:54,500
are you seriously asking me to look the other way on this?

240
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,350
I have been after this son of a bitch for years.

241
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:59,000
He's a thug,ethan.

242
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,410
He's exhibit "A.

243
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:08,630
" The president is prepared to reverse policy

244
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:12,140
and support your amendment to the war crimes act.

245
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:14,470
In exchange for what exactly?

246
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:15,850
The hearings.

247
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:18,150
Declare a recess till after the holidays

248
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:22,210
and then quietly let mr.Bauer's subpoena expire.

249
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:23,690
And if I refuse to go along?

250
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:26,640
The president is prepared to invoke executive privilege.

251
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,010
Executive privilege-- meaning what exactly?

252
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:33,150
Well,that's for the president to decide.

253
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:35,860
Are you talking about a pardon?

254
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:37,650
I wouldn't rule it out.

255
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:39,590
Well,if that's how the president wants to play it,

256
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:44,050
you can tell her she just walked into a street fight.

257
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:46,940
You can tell her yourself.

258
00:12:58,620 --> 00:12:59,970
-Jack.
-Hi,bill.

259
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:03,110
You got here sooner than I expected.

260
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,560
jack.

261
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:08,890
Put down your weapon now!

262
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:12,840
Step away from the desk!

263
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,190
Take a seat.

264
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:15,730
Sit down,bill!

265
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,670
Okay,okay,I'm sitting.

266
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:18,870
Now,what's this all about?

267
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:20,260
-Where is ryan burnett?
-What?

268
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:22,290
Senator mayer's chief of staff-- where is he?

269
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:25,430
I'm not saying anything until you tell me what the hell's going on.

270
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,270
Tony doubled back to one of his contacts,

271
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:29,360
who gave him information of a second attack.

272
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,970
It's going to take place here in washington within the hour.

273
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:33,460
Juma's operatives are carrying it out.

274
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:35,320
Burnett's been supporting them all along.

275
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,860
He knows where the attack's going to take place,

276
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:41,070
so you can either tell me where he is or I will find him myself.

277
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,230
Jack,I can'T.

278
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:47,300
Fine,put your hands behind your back now.

279
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:49,870
How good is the intel?

280
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,820
Good enough for me to need to talk to him.

281
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:54,370
Don't you move.

282
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:57,200
Jack,let me have him arrested.

283
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,690
There are other ways to deal with this.

284
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:00,150
The attack window's open.

285
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:03,000
We're out of time.

286
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:05,660
Jack,listen to me.

287
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:08,540
I spoke to the president on your behalf.

288
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:10,550
She's going to intervene with senator mayer,

289
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:13,070
stop the hearings.

290
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:14,680
You can get your life back.

291
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,650
You do this,you're throwing it all away.

292
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:19,350
I wish I thought there was another option.

293
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:21,660
Let me help you at least,jack.

294
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,520
Y-you don't have to do this alone.

295
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:27,480
Yes,I do.

296
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:31,180
It's the only way I can make sure to keep you out of this.

297
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,910
-Jack.
-Bill,I'm sorry.

298
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:37,050
Jack,w-w-wait!Jack!

299
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,530
It's all right.

300
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:42,130
don't fight it.

301
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,050
-this is moss.
-Larry,it's me.

302
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:18,290
Dubaku's dead.

303
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:20,640
I thought the doctors said he was stabilized.

304
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,370
What happened?

305
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:25,580
Officially,they're characterizing that it was a coronary brought on by systemic shock.

306
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:27,100
Sounds like you don't believe it.

307
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,890
I did a follow-up with the hospital admin.

308
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:31,730
She confirmed that there was an eight-member team on duty when dubaku flatlined.

309
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:32,690
Yeah?

310
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:36,210
There was a ninth man in the icu just before the code was called-- an orderly.

311
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:38,850
I ran back the tapes on the ward and that's when I spotted him.

312
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:41,410
The thing is: I've asked around and nobody seems to know who he is.

313
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:44,400
Renee,wait,a-are you saying you think dubaku was murdered?

314
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,810
I'm saying that there was an unidentified man in with dubaku just

315
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:50,060
before he went into cardiac arrest.

316
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:51,380
What does the admin say?

317
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:52,870
She says that they often use floaters--

318
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:55,940
personnel from other area hospitals filling in from time to time.

319
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:59,180
Said it's not uncommon for the regular staff not to know who they are.

320
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:00,470
She's double-checking with payroll now.

321
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:02,740
Right,so there's your answer.

322
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:03,840
Still it seems odd.

323
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:08,220
I mean,what if dubaku knew something and they needed to shut him up?

324
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:10,490
Is this bauer's theory,too?

325
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:13,750
Jack's not even here and,you know,I resent that implication,larry.

326
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,700
-What implication is that?-That I'm not the one calling the shots.

327
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,220
This has been my investigation from the beginning,

328
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,640
not jack bauer'S.

329
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:22,920
I was just asking a question.I wasn't implying anything.

330
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,090
You there?

331
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:29,420
I'm sorry.I guess I'm a little sensitive on the subject.

332
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:33,290
Look,everything we needed from dubaku,we got.

333
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:36,090
Names and bank accounts of every corrupt official on his payroll.

334
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:38,340
Teams are in the field as we speak.

335
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:39,590
So you're saying you want me to come in.

336
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:41,130
We need you back in the office soor than later

337
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:44,240
to help process all these arrests.

338
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,220
Larry,look,I've got security searching the hospital a nd reviewing more video.

339
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,850
So,what,you want to follow that up first?

340
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:50,700
Fine,call me when you clear it.

341
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,590
I will.Thanks,larry.

342
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:53,890
Excuse me,agent walker?

343
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:55,740
That orderly you were looking for--

344
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:58,070
one of our parking lot cameras picked him up getting into his car.

345
00:16:58,070 --> 00:16:59,840
-When?
-Uh,about 15 minutes ago.

346
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:03,320
I've got a screen grab of his license plate.

347
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:06,690
Thank you.

348
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:12,440
This is agent walker.Put me through to our dmv contact.

349
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:19,160
Are you busy?

350
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:22,550
I'm just reformatting the server,so,yeah,I guess I am busy.W?

351
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:25,200
Well,I was cross-referencing dubaku's offshore accounts

352
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,910
and I came across an orphaned header fragment.

353
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:30,930
-What are you talking about?
-Take a look.

354
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:37,540
Okay,see,there,right there,right there.

355
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:39,840
It's a remnant file header.

356
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,870
It's probably just a phantom data string.

357
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:43,130
No,it isn'T.

358
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:44,670
I ran a systems analysis.

359
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:45,720
The coding is not random.

360
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,010
It can be traced back to one of the accounts.

361
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:51,550
Also,it looks like a name was deleted from the lis

362
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:53,090
why don't I run a recovery program?

363
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:55,530
Well,you're very busy with the reformatting and all,

364
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:59,640
so why don't I just upload it to my station and take care of it there?

365
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,150
Well,that's okay,I can do it faster.

366
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:03,660
No offense.

367
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:08,610
I'll let you know if I retrieve anything.

368
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:11,230
Sure.

369
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:14,160
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

370
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,030
yeah.

371
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:27,250
Have you gotten to burnett yet?

372
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:29,430
Working on it.Making my way over to the west wing.

373
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:32,190
Someone here has figured out that a name has been deleted from the database.

374
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:33,840
I don't know how much longer I can hold her off.

375
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,080
Do they know it was burnett?

376
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,800
No,but it's just a matter of time.

377
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,400
Okay,I'll get back to you.

378
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:42,710
Great.

379
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:45,710
Senator,I'll head back to the hill and get with sandy.

380
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:48,040
We should have a press release drafted by the time you finish your meeting.

381
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:51,090
I'm also going to need a sit-down with your friend hauser at the post.

382
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:52,840
Off the record,I assume.

383
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,340
We've got to make pardoning jack bauer

384
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:58,080
as politically toxic for the president as possible.

385
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,690
She's a woman in a highly emotional state.

386
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:02,030
Her husband's been shot.

387
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:03,440
You suggesting her judgment's impaired?

388
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,800
I'm suggesting that a case could be made.

389
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,910
excuse me,senator.

390
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:10,040
President taylor is ready to see you now.

391
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,540
Go ahead,senator.I'll get this to the ag,

392
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:14,170
tell him you want the option to go ahead with the hearings tomorrow as scheduled.

393
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:16,130
Thanks,ryan.

394
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,330
Yes?

395
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,180
It's burnett.

396
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:27,410
You took care of the problem?

397
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:28,260
I'm leaving now.

398
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:32,460
Good,then we rendezvous at 2130 hours,as planned.

399
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:34,670
I'll be there.

400
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:50,490
Excuse me,I'll be out of here in just one second.

401
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:58,380
You and I... ...we're going to have a talk.

402
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,580
We've got a command post set up at eeob,

403
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,730
and we'll brief cia and diplomatic security,

404
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:17,160
but not until after the first sweep of arrests.

405
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:19,710
Look,nobody is going anywhere,phil.

406
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:21,320
We've dropped a ne on the city.

407
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,280
And I'll let you know as soon as that happens.

408
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,690
All right.

409
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:27,170
I'm sorry to interrupt,but I need you to listen to something.

410
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:29,210
-May I?
-Yeah,that's fine.

411
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:31,880
She's supposed to be this whiz-bang systems analyst,

412
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,460
which is actually what tipped me off in the first place.

413
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:36,030
-Her demeanor is so bizarre...
-w-w-whoa,janis,janis,slow down.

414
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:37,870
-Who are you talking about?
-Chloe o'brian.

415
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:41,380
I ran a systems check on her work,and it turns out there's evidence of file tampering.

416
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:43,990
Plus she's been scrambling all her out-of-office phone calls,

417
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:47,640
so I had operations archive her cellular traffic.

418
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,960
I did a work-around.

419
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,780
Listen.

420
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,450
Have you gotten to burnett yet?

421
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:53,520
Working on it.

422
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,020
Making my way over to the west wing.

423
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,760
Someone here has figured out that a name has been deleted from the database.

424
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,310
Longer I can hold her off.

425
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:00,620
Do they know it was burnett?

426
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:02,660
No,but it's just a matter of time.

427
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:05,220
Okay,I'll get back to you.

428
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,710
Becker.

429
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:13,680
In the conference room.I want chloe o'brian detained.

430
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:16,460
And get her off that server.

431
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:34,570
Get me the white house.

432
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:44,810
Let me just remind you,madam president,you
supported the effort to ban abuse and torture.

433
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:48,150
You campaigned to reform
the intelligence agencies.

434
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:53,230
These past ten hours,senator,things haven't
appeared as black and white as they once did.

435
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,660
Well,there's nothing
gray about jack bauer.

436
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,230
The man has committed atrocities.

437
00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:00,640
Prisoners have died in his custody.

438
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,810
Bauer has served under the aegis
of three presidents,not just me.

439
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:09,800
Is it any more lawful or any less repugnant
if it's authorized at the highest level?

440
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:12,880
A state of war is not a blank check
for the president or for anyone.

441
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:14,670
Oh,don't lecture me,senator.

442
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:18,070
I am well aware of
the limits of my power.

443
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:21,830
Due respect,madam president...
your power is great.

444
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:25,740
Just be careful that you use
it to send the right message.

445
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:30,490
All I'm asking you to do is
excuse mr.Bauer as a witness.

446
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:31,940
It's not a message.

447
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:35,440
It is an expression of gratitude
for what he's done today.

448
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:40,850
Mayer: You're asking me to excuse
him as a target of the investigation.

449
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:43,630
And the message is clear.

450
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:47,360
Under certain circumstances,you
believe his methods are acceptable.

451
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,760
Some would argue that they are.

452
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:51,850
And they would be wrong.

453
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:54,950
Under any military or moral standard.

454
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:58,690
America has been down this
road before,madam president.

455
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:01,390
You yourself called it a national trage.

456
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,400
It was a tragedy.

457
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:05,010
I still believe that.

458
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:10,620
Pardon jack bauer,and you're telling every
interrogator in the field that it's open season again.

459
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:15,760
I'm sorry to interrupt,madam president.

460
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:18,710
There's an urgent call
from larry moss at fbi.

461
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:24,300
- Put him through.
- *******

462
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:26,040
Agent moss is on the line.

463
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:27,560
Agent moss,this is ethan kanin.

464
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:28,980
You're on speaker with the president.

465
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:31,400
Madam president,forgive me for
coming directly to the point.

466
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:33,860
You have a meeting this
evening with senator mayer?

467
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:35,870
In fact,I do.I'm with him right now.

468
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:40,230
Did the senator's chief of staff,ryan
burnett,accompany the senator to the white house?

469
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,810
Yes,he did,agent
moss-- why?

470
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:47,640
I have reason to believe that jack bauer is carrying
out an off-book interrogation of mr.Burnett as we speak.

471
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,100
I can pull the trigger 128 more
times before this battery dies.

472
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,460
I'm telling you,I don't know
anything about an attack.

473
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,410
Stop lying to me.

474
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:03,370
I'm not lying.

475
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:04,370
What's the target?

476
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,600
I can't tell you what I don't know.

477
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:08,240
Mr.Burnett,you are a
traitor and a terrorist.

478
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,560
I'm not.I love my country.

479
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,850
that was 1,200 volts of current.

480
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:18,320
Now,when I eject this cartridge,

481
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:24,850
I access the drive stun mode,upping the
voltage 40 times when directly administered.

482
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,550
All you need to do is talk to me.

483
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,780
Mr.Burnett,it's really simple.

484
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:31,120
Just tell me what the target
is,and this will be all over.

485
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:34,270
I promise.I have no idea
what you're talking about.

486
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:35,670
This is your last chance.

487
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,420
If I knew,I would tell you,I swear it.

488
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,930
What do you want me to say?

489
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:43,200
Just... just tell me what
to say,and I'll say it.

490
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:48,730
don't you even try and
play that game with me.

491
00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:51,180
Mr.Burnett,I've been doing this a long
time,and I can tell the difference,

492
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:55,390
especially when a man is under duress,if he's got
information that I need or if I'm just wasting my time.

493
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:59,150
And I promise you,I
am not wasting my time.

494
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:03,480
the next jolt is gonna
be in your throat.

495
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:08,380
Anything above your neck runs the risk
of a complete neuromuscular shutdown.

496
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:11,190
That means you run the
risk of becoming paralyzed.

497
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,370
No,please.

498
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:16,300
Mr.Burnett,you built the
entire federal case against me.

499
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:21,350
You of all people should know how far I am
willing to go to stop this attack from happening.

500
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:23,820
So,I'm gonna ask you one last time.

501
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:25,620
Where is the target?!

502
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:30,410
I... Okay,okay,okay.

503
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:31,750
I'm listening.

504
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:33,450
Soldiers.

505
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,400
- How many?
- A unit.

506
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:37,210
Juma's presidential guard.

507
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,350
When?

508
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:40,200
It already started.

509
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:42,030
Where?Where?!

510
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:45,040
Mr. Bauer,this is president taylor.

511
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:46,580
Where is the target?

512
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:47,950
- Mr. Bauer...
- wher!

513
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:52,310
Mr. Bauer,I am ordering
you to answer this page.

514
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:53,820
Mr.Bauer,do you hear me?

515
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:55,390
Damn it!

516
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:58,710
Madam president,this is jack bauer.

517
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:01,470
I don't know what you've heard
so far,but this thing is not over.

518
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:04,210
There is another terrorist attack
going to take place within minutes.

519
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:06,660
There will be no discussion
until you unlock this door.

520
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:08,400
Madam president,the
attack window is open.

521
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,910
Juma's men are movg.

522
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:12,460
What you're doing is
against the law,mr.Bauer.

523
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:17,620
I am your commander in chief,and
I am ordering you to stand down.

524
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:22,910
how much longer,sergeant?

525
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:24,050
Good to go,ma'am.

526
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:25,300
Do it.

527
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,520
Where's the target?

528
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,900
Where is the target?!

529
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:29,250
Where is...?!

530
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:34,420
I had him!

531
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:40,470
Man down.

532
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:42,890
Emts to the visiting dignitary suite.

533
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:48,630
You're done,bauer.

534
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,160
You're finished.

535
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:52,010
He was talking.

536
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:55,300
Whatever's going to happen is happening
now,and it's on your conscience.

537
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:58,460
My conscience has a lot less
to answer for than yours.

538
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:09,270
Mr.Bauer,you say an attack is imminent.

539
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:11,010
My source intel is good.

540
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:12,790
Who is your source?

541
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:14,260
I'd rather not say.

542
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,390
The name,mr.Bauer.

543
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,760
Tony almeida.

544
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,600
Tony almeida-- the
man's a fugitive.

545
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:26,930
Without tony almeida,we would
never have recovered the cip device.

546
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,940
Madam president,I don't care if his
source is the blessed virgin mary.

547
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,220
Nothing justifies what
went on in this room.

548
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:35,220
Even if he's right,blaine?

549
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:37,540
Even if it means we could save lives?

550
00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:40,600
Look at that,and tell
me it's not barbarism.

551
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:43,670
Is that something you can live with?

552
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:47,380
Jack: Earlier today,madam president,two
airplanes were brought down.

553
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:49,790
Is that something you can live with?

554
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,670
You're reprehensible,bauer.

555
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:53,430
And you,sir,are weak!

556
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:57,330
Unwilling and unable to look
evil in the eye and deal with it.

557
00:27:57,890 --> 00:28:00,190
Ethan,step out for a second.

558
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:10,170
Suddenly,it's not so hypothetical,is it?

559
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:13,930
In your opinion,is bauer's
intelligence actionable?

560
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:18,520
If bauer says there's going to be an attack,my
belief is,there's going to be an attack.

561
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:25,990
Torture was originally intended
to force false confessions.

562
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:29,060
Now we use it to try and find the truth.

563
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:32,280
These people murdered
your son,madam president.

564
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:34,290
They attempted to murder your husband.

565
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:36,580
They will stop at nothing.

566
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:51,660
Sergeant,take mr.Bauer away.

567
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:53,360
He's under arrest.

568
00:28:58,220 --> 00:28:59,340
You should have come to me.

569
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,060
You should have presented your case.

570
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:02,670
We didn't have time.

571
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:05,690
And would it really have
made a difference,ma'am?

572
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:18,190
Madam president... you're
doing the right thing.

573
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:19,480
271 dead already.

574
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:22,440
I wish to god it felt
more like the right thing.

575
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:25,070
Ethan,raise the threat levels.

576
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,730
Tell homeland they have until 7:00
come  with a response scenario.

577
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:29,700
And get tim down here.

578
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:33,300
Also,I want to talk
to mr.Burnett myself.

579
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,220
Let me do that.

580
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,900
I know the man.

581
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:40,610
Apparently,you don'T.

582
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:58,920
Ethan: Got it.

583
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:04,550
Tim,I understand the threat level has been raised,but
only for first responders and federal agents.

584
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:08,910
There's a concern that mass evacuation by the public
could hamper efforts to thwart an attack when it comes.

585
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:10,760
What about the airspace over washington?

586
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:11,740
Restricted.

587
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:13,380
Military flyovers are commencing.

588
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:18,500
Dod has recommended that we deploy mobile teams to
sweep the area for radioactive and biological signatures.

589
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:21,110
I'll call phillip at the
pentagon and push it through.

590
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,650
What about nsa?

591
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:26,000
There's elevated anti-american
chatter coming from the usual web sites

592
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:28,580
and telephone traffic,but
nothing specific to the attack.

593
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:29,910
Thank you,tim.

594
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:31,200
I'll see you upstairs in 15 minutes.

595
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,400
Yes,ma'am.

596
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:36,610
Which means our best source of intelligence
is still right here under our noses.

597
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:39,930
You realize we're gonna have to
offer this bastard a free pass.

598
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:42,970
With coercive measures off
the table,it's our only option.

599
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:46,590
Uer's going to prison,and
a traitor walks.

600
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:49,250
What's wrong with this picture?

601
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:53,190
I need a minute with the prisoner.

602
00:30:55,930 --> 00:31:03,240
Mr.Burnett,you will be charged with treason under
title 18,section 2381,of the united states code.

603
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:07,870
Giving aid and comfort to the enemy and
directly causing the death of american citizens.

604
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:10,320
Do you understand?

605
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:15,220
Surely,you have something
to say for yourself.

606
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:17,770
I demand my right to counsel.

607
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:24,370
You'll have your counsel,mr.Burnett,but
first,you're going to tell me everything you know.

608
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:26,790
Not in this lifetime.

609
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:28,010
What did you say?

610
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,110
I said,not in this lifetime.

611
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:33,470
Don't be so quick to make
up your mind,mr.Burnett.

612
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:43,240
In exchange for information which stops
or significantly mitigates this attack,

613
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:47,260
the president is prepared to grant
you full immunity from prosecution.

614
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:49,860
I'm sorry.

615
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:50,930
I can't help you.

616
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:54,010
If you and your family are
being threatened in any way...

617
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:59,130
do you realize what the
president is offering you?

618
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:04,460
Treason is a capital offense,mr.Burnett.

619
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:06,730
If you don't cooperate
with us right now,

620
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:11,870
I will make it my personal mission to see that
you pay the ultimate price for your crimes.

621
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:14,760
I won't condone
torture,but in your case,

622
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:17,850
I would have no problem
with the death penalty.

623
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:21,660
Where's my lawyer?

624
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:16,480
Walker.

625
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:19,330
Moss: It's me.That situation at
the hospital you told me about?

626
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:20,780
Yeah,I'm on it,larry.

627
00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:23,460
I traced a license plate
to an import/export firm.

628
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:24,300
Tell me.

629
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:26,950
The orderly I mentioned-- he just
joined up with about a dozen soldiers.

630
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:28,570
Africans.Heavily armed.

631
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:29,450
Where are you?

632
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:32,340
44543 lambourne
marina,near johnson park.

633
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:34,000
I'm in the warehouse basement.

634
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,800
Renee,we have intel on another
attack by juma's people.

635
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:39,630
It's happening in
D.C.,Sometime after 1900 hours.

636
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:41,350
This is it,larry.No question.

637
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:42,600
All right,listen,sit tight.

638
00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:44,370
- I'm on my way with back.
- Make it quick.

639
00:33:45,050 --> 00:33:47,110
Janis,scramble a chopper.

640
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:48,290
On the roof in two minutes.

641
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:49,160
Okay.

642
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,590
- But also...
- janis,just do it.

643
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:54,350
This is larry moss.

644
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:55,850
Put me through to metro police.

645
00:33:56,530 --> 00:33:58,270
Charters,turner--
with me.

646
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:06,720
General,there is no sign of my father.

647
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:08,880
I just spoke with him.

648
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:11,410
Unfortunately he won't
be able to join us.

649
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,450
Why not?

650
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:16,890
Because he got delayed in his attempt to
secure safe passage for us from the country.

651
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:21,400
Then,sir,let me take his
place on the assault team.

652
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:24,430
Spoken like a true dubaku,laurent.

653
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:26,680
But you are also my only
reconnaissance officer.

654
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:29,970
- But,general...
- no,I need you on the perimeter to provide intelligence

655
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:33,450
and also to disrupt whatever
rescue operations there may be.

656
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:35,730
Understood?

657
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:38,620
Understood,sir.

658
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:40,960
Make your final preparations.

659
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:42,780
It is time for us to go.

660
00:34:42,850 --> 00:34:44,170
Yes,sir.

661
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:50,970
yeah?

662
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:52,700
Larry,hurry,they're moving out.

663
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,050
We're ten minutes away.

664
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:56,720
Is it possible that juma
himself is leading this attack?

665
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:58,560
Juma?Why do you say that?

666
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:01,390
I know it sounds crazy,but
i swear that I just saw him.

667
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:02,450
What?!Here?!

668
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,300
Are you sure?

669
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,330
Unless he has an identical twin.

670
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:06,960
All right,I'll alert homeland.

671
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,330
Good work.

672
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:09,790
Any idea what the next target is?

673
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:10,900
Negative.

674
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,980
See if you get a fix on
that.But,listen,don't take any chances.

675
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:15,180
All right?

676
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,680
I won'T.

677
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:17,820
Okay,thank you.

678
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:20,060
Sir.

679
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:21,640
You should have an
emt take a look at you.

680
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:22,730
I'm fine.

681
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:23,700
Is bauer in custody?

682
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:25,210
Yes,sir.He's in holding.

683
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:26,540
That'll be all.

684
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:37,580
tony,it's bill.

685
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:38,180
Bill.

686
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,580
Jack's under arrest.They've got him
locked down in a holding cell here.

687
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:42,700
- Listen to me,bill...
- no,you listen.

688
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,340
We still don't know where
this attack's taking place.

689
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:46,380
Burnett didn't break?

690
00:37:46,450 --> 00:37:49,520
No.They stopped jack before
he could get the information.

691
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,180
And burnett didn't go for
the president's immunity deal.

692
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,790
You were the one who
brought jack the intel,right?

693
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,900
That's right.

694
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:57,260
How real is it?

695
00:37:57,310 --> 00:37:58,300
Very.

696
00:37:58,340 --> 00:38:00,180
Who was your contact?

697
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:02,800
It was a guy in emerson's crew
with a direct line to juma.

698
00:38:02,830 --> 00:38:04,550
Any chance we get
another crack at this guy?

699
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:06,780
That's highly unlikely,to say the least.

700
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,080
What are you telling me,he's dead?

701
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:11,560
That's right?

702
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:14,510
I wish to god you'd
brought me in on this.

703
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,700
Jack didn't want to put
you in that position.

704
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:18,840
For what it's worth,he was
trying to protect you,bill.

705
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,040
Did you have a fallback plan,at least?

706
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:23,200
Immunity for burnett was the fallback.

707
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:25,400
That's it?Nothing else?

708
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,470
No.Nothing.

709
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:34,800
I keep trying renee,and I
keep getting her voice mail.

710
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:35,790
What the hell's gog on?

711
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,130
There's something wrong with her phone.

712
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:39,470
What do you mean,something's wrong?I
just spoke to her five minutes ago.

713
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:40,850
Can you triangulate her position?

714
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:41,990
I can'T.

715
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:43,030
Why not?

716
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:44,400
There's no signal.

717
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:48,080
Either the battery's dead,or
her cell got damaged somehow.

718
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:49,660
All right,keep trying.

719
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:51,100
Get back to me when you know something.

720
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:52,460
Okay.

721
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:33,250
From our location it is approximately
100 meters to the entrance.

722
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:40,140
From this point forward,we maintain
radio silence until the target is secure.

723
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:42,480
Understood?

724
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:43,900
Yes,sir.

725
00:39:50,450 --> 00:39:52,560
You all have your assignments.

726
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:54,910
May god be with us.

727
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:20,920
Laurent,take your position.

728
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,340
Yes,sir.
