1
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:18,313
I'm aware that your generals
are pushing you toward a military response.

2
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,197
Until you have the component

3
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:23,431
I have no choice
but to continue on our present path.

4
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,432
The man with the component
no longer works with the Chinese.

5
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:30,752
He's offered to trade it back to us and...
I've authorised the exchange.

6
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,400
Phillip Bauer is a sociopath.

7
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,836
We can't trust he'll give us the component,
whether we give him the boy or not.

8
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,198
- What are you asking me to do, Karen?
- Whatever it takes to stop the exchange.

9
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,794
It won't be long before
they figure out how I located Jack.

10
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:47,350
They already have.
They're probably on their way to arrest me.

11
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,758
They're here.

12
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,751
Send the kid down now.

13
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,990
Show the sub-circuit board first.

14
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,556
I need to verify it.

15
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,515
There they are. They've got Josh.

16
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,319
I don't have a clear shot
without putting Josh at risk!

17
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,555
Get down!

18
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,676
Get me the names and locations

19
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,435
of every offshore oil platform
within a ten-mile radius.

20
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:21,876
My father didn't pick this location at random.

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,470
Morris, no luck tracing the oil leases
through the CNC servers.

22
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:31,633
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

23
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,711
Chloe. Chloe.

24
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,830
Can someone please help me?
Darling? Darling? Can you hear me?

25
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,956
Can someone please help me?!

26
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,031
Joshua.

27
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,070
- I don't wanna be here with you.
- We're not staying here.

28
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,754
- I don't wanna go anywhere with you!
- Look, Josh...

29
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,799
I don't expect you to understand everything,
not now anyway.

30
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:36,032
Someday you will, and you'll thank me for it.

31
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,510
In the meantime, you'll do as you're told.

32
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,830
Is that clear?

33
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,513
<i>- Good.
- (Cheng speaks Chinese)</i>

34
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,430
- The submarine is on schedule.
- How soon before they pick us up?

35
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,954
30 minutes.

36
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:22,556
Her vitals are strong.
She's in no immediate danger.

37
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,313
- Why did she collapse?
- Dehydration, exhaustion.

38
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,789
She hasn't slept in 36 hours.

39
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:36,396
He said I'm fine, Morris. It's not a big deal.
You should be at your work station.

40
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,074
No, I should be right here with you.

41
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:43,438
You should be checking the EPA database
to see what oil platforms Phillip Bauer owns.

42
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,112
Other people can do that.

43
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,990
If you really wanna make me feel better,
then go find Phillip Bauer.

44
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,548
Are you sure you're all right?

45
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,831
OK, then.

46
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:24,638
- Morris, is Chloe all right?
- The doctor says she's gonna be fine.

47
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,597
Jack was right about his father.

48
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:30,309
One of his companies owns a lease
on an oil platform six miles offshore.

49
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,198
- He has the boy?
- That platform's been decommissioned.

50
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,316
OK, give me the wheel, Nadia.

51
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:40,599
Let's try a thermal scan,
see if we can pick up any signs of life.

52
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,914
That's crowded
for a decommissioned platform.

53
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,959
Can you back-time the satellite imagery
a few minutes?

54
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:03,711
There, that must be Josh Bauer arriving.
That would be 20 minutes after he was taken.

55
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:08,078
Timing works. Send a copy of this to my
screen and forward it to the White House.

56
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,072
<i>- Get me Tom Lennox, please.
- (woman) Right away.</i>

57
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,191
<i>(phone rings)</i>

58
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,190
- Dr Hastings here.
- This is Morris O'Brian.

59
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,714
Have Chloe O'Brian's test results
come in yet?

60
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,588
You just left here a few minutes ago.
We're still running those tests.

61
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,830
Well, when do you expect the results?

62
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,239
Soon.

63
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,311
Can you call me when you get them?

64
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,358
I'm afraid I can't,
not without Ms O'Brian's permission.

65
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,670
<i>- I'm her husband.
- Ex-husband.</i>

66
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:45,914
<i>I'm sorry, but I can only share information
with Ms O'Brian's family.</i>

67
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,991
Fine.

68
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:54,992
Reports indicate the Russians
are setting up an offensive position.

69
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,117
- They could attack at a moment's notice.
- That's correct.

70
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,909
Sir, CTU have just located Phillip Bauer
and a dozen or so confederates

71
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,390
on an oil-drilling platform
six miles off the coast of Los Angeles.

72
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:08,950
- And he has the sub-circuit board?
- We're assuming so, sir.

73
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,271
Pass this on to Suvarov.
It'll buy us more time. Meanwhile...

74
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,920
I want an assault team
despatched to that oil rig.

75
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,276
- Mr Vice President, if I may?
- Go ahead, Ethan.

76
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:22,353
If the platform is well-defended,
an assault team might run into trouble.

77
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,715
I recommend an air attack.

78
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,590
Two navy F-18s could obliterate
that platform and everyone on it.

79
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,639
- What about the sub-circuit board?
- If it's not destroyed, it'll sink.

80
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,712
The saltwater
will render it useless in minutes.

81
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,791
Tom?

82
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,156
We think Phillip Bauer's grandson
is on that same platform.

83
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,518
Now, he might well survive
a surgical strike by an assault team,

84
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,990
but there's no way he'd live
through this proposed aerial attack.

85
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,039
We are talking about
an innocent 16-year-old boy here.

86
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,635
None of us like this,
but if the Russians attack our base,

87
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,156
a lot of innocent young men are gonna die.

88
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:07,279
And an air strike would be the most effective
from a political point of view.

89
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:13,356
It'll show the Russians that we're sparing
no effort to destroy the sub-circuit board.

90
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:21,038
- Send the F-18s immediately.
- Yes, sir, Mr Vice President.

91
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,473
- You'll be all right. You'll make it.
- Jack, I'm sorry.

92
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,155
- You were following your orders.
- Get the kid. Get the kid, Jack.

93
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,231
<i>- I will.
- (phone rings)</i>

94
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:37,114
- Did you find my father?
- Yes, on an oil platform six miles offshore.

95
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,952
Is Josh with him?

96
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:42,669
Thermal scan shows three people arriving
20 minutes after Josh was taken,

97
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:46,878
- so it's highly likely he was one of them.
- Nadia, I wanna lead the assault team.

98
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,394
- There's not gonna be an assault team.
- What?

99
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:53,996
I just got notification that the White House
has ordered air strike by navy F-18s.

100
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,959
The vice president thinks
an assault team will take too long.

101
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,270
- When will it happen?
- Less than 30 minutes.

102
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:06,833
Look, I need you and Bill to come back to
CTU on Aerial One for an immediate debrief.

103
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,433
<i>Jack?</i>

104
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,511
Fine.

105
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,388
- What's wrong?
- CTU located my father and Josh

106
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,596
on one of the offshore oil platforms.

107
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:21,276
There's no assault. They've launched an air
strike. No one on that platform will survive.

108
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,715
I'm sorry, Jack.

109
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:29,955
Jack, don't even think about it. You wanna
get yourself killed? You won't save Josh.

110
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:33,271
- I realise he's your nephew.
- I'm not gonna do it because of that.

111
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,478
I'm gonna do it cos he's an innocent kid
being written off as an acceptable loss.

112
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,152
It's wrong.

113
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:44,075
Nadia's ordered us back to CTU
on Chopper One. I'm gonna take it.

114
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:47,118
I'll fly. You prep the weapons.

115
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,993
It's been a while, but I can get us to
the platform. With luck, I might get us back.

116
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,629
- You don't need to do this, Bill.
- Yes, I do.

117
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:59,474
I don't wanna live with this one, either.

118
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,551
Let's get ready.

119
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,111
You're gonna need that.

120
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,669
We're commandeering your helicopter.
Get out. Now!

121
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:16,954
<i>Matching target coordinates.
We'll be in range in 22 minutes.</i>

122
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,237
Sir, significant numbers of Russian troops

123
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,393
have assumed a flanking position
along the eastern rim of our military base.

124
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,277
What am I to take from that?

125
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:32,069
A tactical advancement like that
indicates imminent attack.

126
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,879
<i>(Lennox) All right, put him through.</i>

127
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,109
Sir.

128
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,589
- You got Suvarov?
- Yes, sir.

129
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,798
Mr President, this is Vice President Daniels.

130
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:51,273
Mr Vice President, the last time we spoke,
you said an opportunity had presented itself.

131
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,831
Unfortunately, that didn't work out. But there
has been a significant new development,

132
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,675
and I'm asking you to hold off
on any military assault on our base.

133
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,671
For what reason, sir?

134
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,272
The Chinese agents
who are in possession of the component

135
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,749
are on an oil platform off our West Coast.

136
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:12,628
<i>We assume they are there
waiting transport to China.</i>

137
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:19,114
I've ordered an air strike to destroy the
platform before that rendezvous can happen.

138
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:24,832
I realise that you have no reason
to accept what I'm telling you...

139
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,280
not without proof, but I implore you...

140
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,238
Mr Vice President, I believe you.

141
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:34,835
Moments ago, one of our listening posts
intercepted a transmission

142
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,832
to a Chinese submarine operating
in the western Pacific.

143
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,992
The point of origin is ten miles off your coast.

144
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:44,868
And the contents suggest the submarine
is en route to pick up the component.

145
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:50,637
- Then you know that I'm telling you the truth.
- You say you've launched an air strike?

146
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:55,475
Yes, that's the only way we can make certain
that the component's been destroyed.

147
00:11:55,560 --> 00:12:01,669
Sir, we're prepared to give you a real-time
uplink to our satellite feed of the assault.

148
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,430
One moment, please, sir.

149
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:12,959
How long until your fighters reach the target?

150
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,554
Less then 20 minutes, sir.

151
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,835
20 minutes, Mr President.

152
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:25,472
Very well. But be advised, nothing less than
the complete destruction of this oil platform

153
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,630
will give us the assurance we require.

154
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,915
Understood.

155
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,833
Stand by, the satellite feed
will be there momentarily.

156
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,229
I wish you luck, Mr Vice President.

157
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:47,071
The coastguard and the navy are patrolling
a five-mile perimeter around the target.

158
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:51,756
<i>- (man) I want real-time updates.
- Yes, sir. I'll keep you in the loop.</i>

159
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,195
- What is it?
- Jack commandeered the chopper.

160
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:57,238
- He requested an uplink to our satellite feed.
- What?

161
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:02,314
He's on the way to the oil platform.
He's with Bill Buchanan.

162
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,469
<i>- (Nadia) Aerial One, confirm. Come in.
- This is Bauer. We copy.</i>

163
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:13,792
Jack, I know you wanna save your nephew,
but I can't authorise a suicide mission.

164
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,235
We don't need authorisation, we need help.

165
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,959
Those F-18s will be in striking range
in 18 minutes.

166
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:23,431
- What if we find the component first?
- The strike team's orders are noncontingent.

167
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:26,239
<i>- All you'll do is get yourselves killed.
- It's Bill.</i>

168
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:32,316
I understand the pressure you're under,
but believe me, this is the right call to make.

169
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,196
You need a visual on the oil platform?

170
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:42,670
Yes. We need to know how many hostiles
and where they are.

171
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:45,752
- Uploading the latest satellite capture.
- You'll have it.

172
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,513
- Copy that. Send it to my PDA.
- PDA, got it.

173
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,160
Thank you, Nadia. You did the right thing.

174
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:02,676
Bill, I need you to put your comm unit in.

175
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,029
- How should I make our approach, Jack?
- Wind's heavy out of the west.

176
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:13,749
If we fly into it and stay low,
we should be able to catch them off-guard.

177
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,513
- It won't buy us much time.
- Engage them from the air.

178
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,752
I'll hold them off so you can land,
then we'll move in.

179
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,469
<i>The target is locked and acquired.</i>

180
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,713
Josh, we leave in 15 minutes.

181
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,276
Please, just let me go.

182
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,112
- I can't do that.
- Why not?

183
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,191
Because I can't!

184
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:55,072
You have a lot to learn.
Now it's my responsibility to teach you.

185
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,230
First lesson is, pay attention.

186
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,917
<i>(Cheng speaks Chinese)</i>

187
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,356
What is it?

188
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:16,319
There's a helicopter approaching.
We need to get to the boat and head west.

189
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:20,393
There's a locator beacon on board.
The submarine will pick us up.

190
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,349
Here, take the component.

191
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:27,910
I'll see about the helicopter.
I'll join you shortly.

192
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,391
Let's go, Josh.

193
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:49,758
Once we hit the deck,
we're gonna have to move hard.

194
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,878
- You ready to move up?
- Ready!

195
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,951
Take it up!

196
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,838
You're clear to land!

197
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,796
<i>(shouts in Chinese)</i>

198

Where's the boy? Where's the boy?!

199
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:45,989
- You're too late. You're too late.
- Take this. Get him up to the chopper.

200
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,799
- What are you doing?
- Making sure Josh isn't here.

201
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,350
We only have ten minutes.
Get up! Get up!

202
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,431
Go! Go!

203
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,956
- Come on, Josh, stop it!
- I can't.

204
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:24,238
Of course you can.
All it takes is a little self-control.

205
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,880
You're behaving like a child.

206
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,236
You have to learn to control your emotions.

207
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:37,510
You must never let them control you,
you understand?

208
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,275
Good. Come on.

209

<i>Target will be in range

I'm not going with you.

211
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,829
You're not gonna shoot me.
Give me the gun.

212
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,432
- Now.
- No!

213
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,798
As long as you're alive,
me and my mom will never be safe.

214
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,599
Josh, listen to me.

215
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:54,195
- I've always cared about you.
- No! You only care about yourself.

216
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:57,158
That's not true.
You're the reason I'm doing all this.

217
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,231
- Shut up!
- I love you, Josh.

218
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,356
Argh!

219
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,669
Josh!

220
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:14,556
It's all right. I've got him.
You can lower that weapon.

221
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,436
Josh.

222
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,311
Lower your gun.

223
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,196
I know how scared and angry
you must feel right now.

224
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:30,638
I know. I've been exactly where you are.
I know exactly how you feel.

225
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:35,597
But trust me, you do not wanna live
with the pain of taking another person's life,

226
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:38,877
even if you think they deserve it.

227
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,872
In a few minutes, there's gonna be
an F-18 air strike here.

228
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,872
We need to get out of here.
We need to get out of here now.

229

Please.

230
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:50,836
It's all right. Just give me the gun.

231
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:54,117
It's all right. It's all right.
It's over. It's over.

232
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:58,193
I need you to get up to the top of the platform
and get in the chopper now. Go. Move!

233
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,636
- What about you?
- I'll be right behind you. Keep going.

234

Get up.

235

Get up! It's over.

236
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,311
- Then finish it.
- No.

237
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:15,148
You are gonna be held accountable
for what you have done today.

238
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,390
I don't think so.

239
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:24,388
You don't have time to carry me. Not if
what you said about the air strike is true.

240
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,950
And you don't wanna die, not here.

241
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,390
Not with me.

242
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:42,313
You're gonna get off easy.

CTU, this is Aerial One.
My count shows the strike in two minutes.

244

Negative, you have 90 seconds before
those F-18s are within striking range.

245
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,674

Good, Mr President. You will excuse me

Yes, of course.

And Mr Vice President,

279
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,799
I regret that the events of this day

280
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,395
have brought us to such a dangerous
and unfortunate situation,

281
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,155
but when my country's security
is threatened...

282
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,755
I understand, Mr President, all too well.

283
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,195
Yes, I'm sure you do.

He's all right.

290

- Where are we going?
- Back to CTU.

291
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,075
No, we can't. We have to go back for him.

292
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,799
Jack's not ready to go back yet.

that the Chinese have recalled
their sub to its base at Ningpo.

Tell Admiral Smith to shadow them. I want
them to know we're aware of their activities.

Yes, sir.

00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:03,275
And thank you, Ethan, for everything.

299
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:07,035
Extend my gratitude to the Joint Chiefs.

300
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,317
Congratulations, Mr Vice President.

301
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,714
Sir, not to quash your flush of victory here,

302
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:17,998
the actions of the Chinese
cannot go unaddressed.

303
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:21,868
We'll leave that for another day, Tom.

304
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,997
Right now, I don't know about you,
but I could use some sleep.

305
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:31,189
There's just one other outstanding issue
I would like to discuss with you, sir.

306
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,918
Karen Hayes?

307
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,834
She's about to be transferred
into FBI custody.

308
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:39,673
Now, in light of the recent terrorist attacks,

309
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,957
the nuke in California,
the plot against the president,

310
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:47,716
I just think we need to preserve
whatever fragile faith

311
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:53,511
the American people might still have
in this administration.

312
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:59,068
Just let Karen and Bill resign
with their reputations intact.

313
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,991
All right, Tom.

314
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:08,235
Take care of that for me.

315
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,515
All right. Thank you, sir.

316
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:17,119
Here's that tape recording you asked for.

317
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,839
- Hey.
- Hi.

318
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,070
- How you feeling?
- Good.

319
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:43,590
- Jack got the boy out. They're both safe.
- What about the Russians?

320
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:47,275
They backed off. They were satisfied
the component was destroyed.

321
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,920
- Jack's father?
- He was killed in the air strike.

322
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,036
And Cheng is in custody.

323
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:54,395
- Good.
- Look...

324
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,119
I was talking to Dr Hastings.

325
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:02,797
He says the test results are in, but he's not
telling me anything. He insists I talk to you.

326
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:06,348
Is it... serious?

327
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,554
Yeah.

328
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:13,760
Bloody hell, Chloe. Whatever it is,
I'll help you get through it.

329
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,912
- No, you won't. We're not together.
- Oh, sod that.

330
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:22,829
Really, come on, when you collapsed,
I thought something might really be wrong.

331
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:25,559
I can't lose you, darling.

332
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:28,757
- Really?
- Yeah, really. I love you.

333
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:33,990
OK. That's good, cos I'm pregnant.

334
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,277
You mean... what? With child?

335
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,829
That's usually how it works.

336
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:53,517
- Chloe...
- You know, this is a nice moment.

337
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:57,195
Let's not ruin it by saying something stupid.

338
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,669
Let's just go back to work.

339
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,588
OK.

340
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,597
OK.

341
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,991
- Tom?
- Karen.

342
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:25,438
- You've come to say goodbye?
- Well, in a manner of speaking.

343
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:31,709
You're free to go. The vice president
is dropping all charges against you.

344
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:37,715
- What about Bill?
- He's being pardoned as well.

345
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:40,553
The vice president
still expects your resignations,

346
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:45,953
but you're free to go live your lives
without fear of prosecution.

347
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:48,031
Is that suitable?

348
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:51,275
Yes, yes, yes, it is.

349
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,669
All right. Well, good luck.

350
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:57,548
I know you had a hand in this, Tom.
Thank you.

351
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:00,837
You know, Karen,
I actually think I'm gonna miss you.

352
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,437
Really?

353
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:07,195
I can answer that better after you've gone.

354
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,835
There's your mother.

355
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,993
You'll be debriefed
at a federal detention facility.

356
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:49,119
My people will not abandon me
like you abandoned Jack Bauer.

357
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,551
Get him out of here.

358
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,834
- It's good to see you again, sir.
- Good work today. You should be proud.

359
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:08,196
Thank you.
That means a lot coming from you.

360
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,155
Where's Jack?

361
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:19,392
He fell from the chopper into the ocean
during the extraction.

362
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:22,074
He made it to shore. He's fine.

363
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:25,072
- Why didn't you pick him up?
- He didn't want me to.

364
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:30,150
- I don't understand. We need to find him.
- We'll never find him.

365
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,515
Not if he doesn't want us to.

366
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,078
Let him go.

367
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:43,715
Somehow itjust doesn't feel real.
But I am grateful that she's alive.

368
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:46,553
<i>- (woman) Let me know if I can do anything.
- Of course.</i>

369
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,437
<i>Anything at all.</i>

370
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:51,239
I'll let you know. Thanks.

371
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,351
<i>(door clicks open)</i>

372
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,715
Put it down.

373
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,519
Now.

374
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:37,437
- Are you here to kill me?
- Depends.

375
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,715
Where is Audrey?

376
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:43,194
I told you, you're not
getting anywhere near her.

377
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:47,114
You do not tell me what to do any more!
Do you understand me?

378
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,839
You do not tell me what to do.

379
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:56,077
I just watched my father die,
and I felt nothing.

380
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,276
You know why?

381
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:01,149
Yeah, you know why.

382
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:05,357
Because that man was dead to me years ago.

383
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:09,797
I admired you.
I looked up to you like a father.

384
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:13,190
You were the kind of man I wanted to be,
and you took advantage of it!

385
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:17,398
- Jack, listen to me.
- No! You are gonna listen to me.

386
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:26,759
Earlier today, you said that I was cursed,

387
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:33,157
that anyone I touched
ended up dead or ruined.

388
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:38,153
How dare you? How dare you?

389
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:42,358
The only thing I did,
the only thing I have ever done,

390
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:45,671
is what you and people like you
have asked of me.

391
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:54,751
- Why didn't you try to get me out of China?
- I did try.

392
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:57,673
Not hard enough!

393
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:01,109
You had the political power.

394
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:07,350
Was the timing not right?
Was it a little too complicated?

395
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:11,910
- Or was I just an acceptable loss?
- Jack, I understand your anger.

396
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,036
Shut up!

397
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,477
You don't understand a thing about me.

398
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,991
But I know you.

399
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:29,631
I know why you're angry at me, and it wasn't
because Audrey went to China to save me.

400
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:34,396
It was because when you told her not to,
she did it anyway.

401
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:41,389
You'll never understand
that kind of commitment, that kind of loyalty.

402
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:44,074
You're right, Jack.

403
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:49,995
It wasn't fair of me to put all this on you,
to blame you for what happened to Audrey.

404
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:52,958
I know the sacrifices you've made.

405
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:57,991
I know this country owes you
more than it'll ever repay.

406
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:02,312
I'm not interested in what you think
this country owes me.

407
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:06,873
I want my life back, and I want it now.

408
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:12,673
Audrey's all I've got, and you can't stop me.

409
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:18,192
In case you've forgotten,
I'm very good at disappearing.

410
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:22,478
And if you try sending someone after us,
I'll kill 'em.

411
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,551
Pretty good at that too.

412
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:33,239
Simply getting your life back, Jack,
isn't gonna change who you are.

413
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:37,632
And you can't walk away from it.
You know that. You've tried it.

414
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:40,314
Sooner or later,
you're gonna get back in the game,

415
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:44,632
and my daughter's gonna pay the price,
like your wife did.

416
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:51,798
- You son of a bitch.
- Jack.

417
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:55,350
I beg you, just stop for a moment and think.

418
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,516
Think, Jack.

419
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:02,354
You won't be able to take care of her
the way you want to.

420
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,431
Where is she?

421
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:08,269
Take me to her now.

422
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,831
Hey.

423
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,116
It's me. I'm here.

424
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,475
I know that I promised...

425
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,191
to take care of you,

426
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,671
and protect you,

427
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,031
but I'm at a crossroads.

428
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,309
Right now, the best way...

429
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,031
the only way...

430
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:07,518
to do that is to let you go.

431
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:15,797
I hope one day you can understand that.

432
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:25,513
I hope one day you can forgive me.

433
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:38,588
I love you with all my heart.

434
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,550
I always will.

435
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:09,311
