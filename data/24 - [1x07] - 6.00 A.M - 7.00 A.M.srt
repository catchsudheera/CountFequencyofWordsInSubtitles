1
00:00:16,373 --> 00:00:18,409
There's been an assassination threat.

2
00:00:18,493 --> 00:00:21,291
- That's what all the fuss is about?
- Yes.

3
00:00:21,373 --> 00:00:22,965
I thought it was something serious.

4
00:00:23,053 --> 00:00:26,045
- You still want the job, David?
- You know I do.

5
00:00:26,133 --> 00:00:30,172
Then you need to come out
with the story about Keith.

6
00:00:32,693 --> 00:00:36,163
Who are you? Where's my father?

7
00:00:47,453 --> 00:00:49,842
There's a murder victim
he asked me to ID.

8
00:00:49,933 --> 00:00:53,164
Tell him the murder victim's
name is Alan York.

9
00:00:55,533 --> 00:00:59,811
- I'm sorry, Nina. Could you say that again?
- Alan York. An accountant from the valley.

10
00:01:04,173 --> 00:01:05,765
That was quick.

11
00:01:05,853 --> 00:01:09,129
Do what I tell you, Jack,
and you might see your daughter again.

12
00:01:09,213 --> 00:01:13,047
Walk away now, or Kimberly
gets a bullet in her head.

13
00:01:16,053 --> 00:01:18,044
Tuck it in your ear.

14
00:01:21,413 --> 00:01:25,611
- Now say something.
- If you hurt my daughter, I will kill you.

15
00:01:25,693 --> 00:01:27,684
Good. There's a nice, clear signal.

16
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:34,212
You're seeing the senator in an hour.
Get going, or you'll hit traffic.

17
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:40,084
I'm on my way.

18
00:04:10,813 --> 00:04:13,805
Eyes straight ahead, Jack.

19
00:04:13,893 --> 00:04:15,884
Let the cops go.

20
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:31,844
It's a green light, Jack.

21
00:04:32,413 --> 00:04:34,404
Make a right.

22
00:04:38,373 --> 00:04:41,171
I left something   under your visor.

23
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:47,847
What do you want me to do with this?

24
00:04:47,933 --> 00:04:50,447
I'll tell you when you get to your office.

25
00:05:01,053 --> 00:05:03,044
You pull something off the key card?

26
00:05:03,133 --> 00:05:05,931
- I may be close to finding your assassin.
- You got a name?

27
00:05:06,013 --> 00:05:11,406
Almost. This is a scrambled medical file
listing a series of plastic surgeries.

28
00:05:11,493 --> 00:05:14,166
The shooter's probably
trying to hide his identity.

29
00:05:14,253 --> 00:05:16,289
Or assume someone else's.

30
00:05:16,373 --> 00:05:20,366
- To get close to Palmer.
- Mm-hm. Call me when you get a name.

31
00:05:21,653 --> 00:05:23,644
Right.

32
00:05:34,573 --> 00:05:36,689
Pull over.

33
00:05:39,693 --> 00:05:42,366
- Keith!
- Let my man bring him in.

34
00:05:42,453 --> 00:05:43,044
No.

35
00:05:43,133 --> 00:05:46,284
- Senator, there's a threat on your life.
- Call your man off.

36
00:05:46,373 --> 00:05:48,443
Sir! All right, Jimmy, stand down.

37
00:05:48,813 --> 00:05:50,610
- Keith! Hold up.
- Go away.

38
00:05:50,693 --> 00:05:53,810
- I need to talk to you.
- Mom said you're doin' all the talkin'.

39
00:05:53,893 --> 00:05:56,691
At the breakfast
I'm gonna tell our side of the story.

40
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:57,649
Our side?

41
00:05:57,733 --> 00:06:01,612
Before Maureen Kingsley can put it out,
spin it the wrong way.

42
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:05,292
It won't matter how the story comes out.

43
00:06:05,373 --> 00:06:11,209
Everyone will still think I went to kill Gibson.
Who's gonna believe it was an accident?

44
00:06:11,293 --> 00:06:13,602
I believe you, son, if you say so.

45
00:06:16,693 --> 00:06:20,732
Look, when your mother and I
go to this breakfast in an hour,

46
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:23,281
- we want you and Nicole to come with us.
- Why?

47
00:06:23,373 --> 00:06:27,048
So you can save your campaign
by sacrificing me to CNN?

48
00:06:27,133 --> 00:06:30,364
So I can stand by you, as your father.

49
00:06:32,853 --> 00:06:35,413
It's a little late for that.

50
00:06:35,493 --> 00:06:39,725
- You never gave me a chance to help you.
- How could I? You weren't there!

51
00:06:43,453 --> 00:06:46,684
You... you can tell yourself
whatever you want,

52
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:50,004
but your career always came first.

53
00:06:51,773 --> 00:06:57,166
For you to expect me to stand up in front of
everyone now and act like we're this family...

54
00:06:58,973 --> 00:07:00,964
We are a family, Keith.

55
00:07:10,213 --> 00:07:11,885
Keith!

56
00:07:28,653 --> 00:07:31,645
You missed a spot, right here on your neck.

57
00:07:34,573 --> 00:07:36,928
Rick, help me get out of here.

58
00:07:37,013 --> 00:07:40,085
How? This place is like a prison.

59
00:07:40,893 --> 00:07:44,010
People break out of prison all the time.

60
00:07:45,053 --> 00:07:49,126
Look, Gaines said he'd let me go
after I'd buried Dan.

61
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:55,292
Now, once I'm out of here,
I'll call your dad and tell him where you are.

62
00:07:55,373 --> 00:07:58,251
Great plan, except you're not gonna get out.

63
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:01,325
- Gaines won't let you go.
- He's got no reason to stop me.

64
00:08:01,413 --> 00:08:04,291
- He doesn't need me any more.
- Exactly.

65
00:08:29,093 --> 00:08:32,688
- What do you want me to do here?
- Replace the key card we gave you

66
00:08:32,773 --> 00:08:35,765
with the one your people
are trying to decrypt.

67
00:08:36,173 --> 00:08:39,449
- Because we're getting too close?
- Just do it, Jack.

68
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:46,370
Remember, Jack,
I can hear everything.

69
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:54,406
I've been trying to reach you.
What is going on?

70
00:08:54,493 --> 00:08:57,883
- My cellphone battery died.
- What happened at the hospital?

71
00:08:57,973 --> 00:09:01,966
- Did you find Kim?
- Everything's fine. She was just at a party.

72
00:09:02,053 --> 00:09:05,204
- That's good. Did Teri give you my message?
- No.

73
00:09:05,293 --> 00:09:09,081
We ID'd the corpse you brought in.
His name is Alan York.

74
00:09:10,053 --> 00:09:12,487
- What?
- He's an accountant from the valley.

75
00:09:12,573 --> 00:09:14,848
We still don't know
how he's connected to this.

76
00:09:14,933 --> 00:09:17,925
But we did have a breakthrough
in the key card.

77
00:09:19,173 --> 00:09:21,164
Give me one minute.

78
00:09:25,453 --> 00:09:28,650
If Alan York is dead,
who is the man with my wife?

79
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:32,086
He's not an accountant from the valley,
that's for sure.

80
00:09:32,173 --> 00:09:35,643
If you harm my daughter or my wife,
I will kill you, you son of a bitch.

81
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:41,088
Oh, my God! What have you done?
What have you done?!

82
00:09:42,933 --> 00:09:47,927
Everything's fine, Jack. But that will be
the last sound your wife and daughter hear

83
00:09:48,013 --> 00:09:51,892
unless you get hold of yourself
and you do as you're told.

84
00:09:51,973 --> 00:09:55,010
- I'll do what you want.
- That's the spirit.

85
00:09:55,533 --> 00:10:00,368
Now, the key card. I want you to replace it
with the one you took from the car.

86
00:10:01,173 --> 00:10:04,768
- That won't be easy.
- Well, I'm sure you'll find a way.

87
00:10:04,853 --> 00:10:06,844
Not without attracting attention.

88
00:10:06,933 --> 00:10:09,686
That would be unacceptable.
You implicate yourself,

89
00:10:09,773 --> 00:10:12,924
you cease to be useful
and so does your family.

90
00:10:13,013 --> 00:10:16,369
As I said, Jack, find a way.

91
00:10:21,693 --> 00:10:24,082
- Fine.
- OK.

92
00:10:32,133 --> 00:10:36,172
The cellular customer you are trying to reach
is currently out of range.

93
00:10:36,253 --> 00:10:38,721
Please leave a message at the tone.

94
00:10:38,813 --> 00:10:43,011
Kevin. Bauer's wife knows
you're not Alan York. Be careful.

95
00:10:48,573 --> 00:10:51,645
- You OK?
- I feel a little woozy.

96
00:10:51,733 --> 00:10:54,566
We're almost there.
Janet said the party was up this hill.

97
00:10:54,653 --> 00:10:58,441
- I'm sorry, but I think I'm gonna be sick.
- Try and take deep breaths.

98
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:01,172
Would you just pull over and stop the car?

99
00:11:25,173 --> 00:11:27,767
You have one new message.

100
00:11:29,653 --> 00:11:33,089
.. Bauer's wife... not Alan York.
Be careful.

101
00:11:52,733 --> 00:11:54,724
Teri?

102
00:11:57,973 --> 00:11:59,964
Teri?

103
00:12:03,293 --> 00:12:05,284
Teri!

104
00:12:06,653 --> 00:12:08,644
Dammit.

105
00:13:42,013 --> 00:13:44,004
Come on.

106
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:47,683
Oh, dammit.

107
00:14:01,093 --> 00:14:03,732
Dan's buried.

108
00:14:03,813 --> 00:14:05,804
Oh, that's good.

109
00:14:10,533 --> 00:14:13,605
You said you'd pay me
when we got back here.

110
00:14:13,693 --> 00:14:16,161
Yeah, I know what I said.

111
00:14:16,253 --> 00:14:19,165
Well, if it's a problem, pay me whenever.

112
00:14:19,253 --> 00:14:21,608
Oh, that's very kind of you, Rick.

113
00:14:21,693 --> 00:14:25,686
But I should probably go,
get out of everyone's way.

114
00:14:25,773 --> 00:14:30,324
- I didn't realise you were in anyone's way.
- Well, I'm not, it's just...

115
00:14:30,413 --> 00:14:34,964
I did everything you wanted me to do,
so there's no reason for me to be here.

116
00:14:36,453 --> 00:14:38,603
Tell you what.

117
00:14:38,693 --> 00:14:43,528
I've got a couple more things for you to do,
and then we can talk about when you can go.

118
00:15:07,613 --> 00:15:09,444
This is taking too long, Jack.

119
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:13,492
I can't just switch the cards. It'll attract
attention that'll be bad for us both.

120
00:15:13,573 --> 00:15:16,406
You've got three minutes
to make this happen.

121
00:15:22,093 --> 00:15:24,732
Fine, I'll do it.

122
00:15:24,813 --> 00:15:29,011
I just need to make it look natural
when I go down to the work station.

123
00:15:33,413 --> 00:15:36,962
Drop the pen and shred the paper.

124
00:15:41,853 --> 00:15:44,287
That's right, Jack. I'm watching you.

125
00:15:46,453 --> 00:15:49,047
Shred the note now or your daughter dies.

126
00:15:56,853 --> 00:16:01,051
What happened? I was telling you something
important and you just walk away.

127
00:16:01,133 --> 00:16:03,442
I'm sorry. What did you wanna tell me?

128
00:16:03,533 --> 00:16:06,889
- I think Milo's about to identify the shooter.
- That's great.

129
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:12,888
- We just need a few minutes with the card.
- Switch it, Jack. No more excuses.

130
00:16:12,973 --> 00:16:14,691
Um...

131
00:16:14,773 --> 00:16:19,369
Look, that's terrific. Uh...
Tell Milo to wait until I get down there.

132
00:16:19,453 --> 00:16:22,126
- Stop working on the card?
- Just until I get there.

133
00:16:22,213 --> 00:16:24,522
- Why?
- Because I asked you to!

134
00:16:26,533 --> 00:16:29,286
Look, I'm only gonna be a minute.

135
00:16:29,373 --> 00:16:32,206
All right. But hurry. He's in section seven.

136
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:37,324
I'll be right down.

137
00:16:49,573 --> 00:16:54,283
Palmer was absent from the rally, but he was
represented by his children, Nicole and Keith,

138
00:16:54,373 --> 00:16:57,922
who've been instrumental in bringing
the younger voter to this election.

139
00:16:58,013 --> 00:17:02,165
And Governor Hodges spent the morning
with heads of California’s labour unions,

140
00:17:02,253 --> 00:17:05,643
discussing the importance
of his new healthcare proposal.

141
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:11,012
It would ensure comprehensive coverage
of millions of active union members.

142
00:17:12,973 --> 00:17:16,329
Also this morning
Governor Hodges will meet with...

143
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:19,722
Mom told you what's been going on?

144
00:17:20,613 --> 00:17:22,683
Yeah.

145
00:17:28,373 --> 00:17:30,728
Is Keith goin' to jail?

146
00:17:36,613 --> 00:17:39,889
- Not if it happened the way he says it did.
- It did.

147
00:17:39,973 --> 00:17:42,248
Then he'll be fine.

148
00:17:44,533 --> 00:17:47,093
Is he coming to the breakfast?

149
00:17:48,493 --> 00:17:50,484
I hope so.

150
00:17:56,493 --> 00:17:58,882
Listen, I know it's a lot to ask.

151
00:18:01,093 --> 00:18:03,084
Don't worry, Dad.

152
00:18:04,573 --> 00:18:06,882
I'll be there.

153
00:18:11,853 --> 00:18:15,641
You're gonna get a lot of
hard questions thrown at you.

154
00:18:15,733 --> 00:18:19,123
Not just about Keith.
They're gonna bring up the rape.

155
00:18:20,453 --> 00:18:22,284
I know.

156
00:18:24,893 --> 00:18:27,487
You're gonna be OK.

157
00:18:29,093 --> 00:18:31,084
I was hoping it was over.

158
00:18:34,453 --> 00:18:37,047
Not talking about it all these years...

159
00:18:39,173 --> 00:18:42,688
I started to let myself
believe it never happened.

160
00:18:46,173 --> 00:18:49,051
You don't have to answer
anything you don't want to.

161
00:18:51,093 --> 00:18:54,210
Just say "No comment". Or refer them to me.

162
00:19:39,653 --> 00:19:41,803
You're close to finding the shooter?

163
00:19:41,893 --> 00:19:43,611
- Yeah.
- How much longer?

164
00:19:43,693 --> 00:19:47,732
- Not long. I was waiting for you.
- Why would you be waiting for me?

165
00:19:49,373 --> 00:19:51,807
- Sorry.
- It's fine. I got it.

166
00:19:54,253 --> 00:19:57,370
Nina told me
to hold off till you got here.

167
00:19:57,453 --> 00:19:59,569
She must've misunderstood me.

168
00:19:59,653 --> 00:20:01,609
That's my boy.

169
00:20:03,613 --> 00:20:06,605
I just wasted ten minutes.
Get your signals straight.

170
00:20:06,693 --> 00:20:08,684
Milo, just get me the name.

171
00:20:27,453 --> 00:20:29,444
Why are you doing this?

172
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:33,202
No, I already gave you that code.

173
00:20:34,453 --> 00:20:36,364
- What's wrong?
- What's wrong?

174
00:20:36,453 --> 00:20:39,763
I already computed this inverse,
and now it's not working.

175
00:20:39,853 --> 00:20:44,165
- It might be the sectors aren't linked.
- Oh, you think so, huh?

176
00:20:55,253 --> 00:20:56,891
You were right.

177
00:21:00,533 --> 00:21:02,683
- Nice one.
- Cool.

178
00:21:08,213 --> 00:21:10,204
- Hey! Hey!
- Bad idea.

179
00:21:11,293 --> 00:21:14,091
You flag down that car,
you bury your daughter.

180
00:21:14,173 --> 00:21:16,164
I'm your only hope of getting her back.

181
00:21:16,253 --> 00:21:19,006
If I don't deliver you in half an hour,
Kimberly's dead.

182
00:21:19,093 --> 00:21:21,812
Where is she, you son of a bitch?

183
00:21:21,893 --> 00:21:25,010
You gonna knock me out again?
I can't talk if I'm unconscious.

184
00:21:25,093 --> 00:21:28,130
- Where's Kimberly?
- Let me go and I'll take you to her.

185
00:21:28,213 --> 00:21:31,523
You're not going anywhere.

186
00:21:31,613 --> 00:21:35,731
Calling the cops would be just as bad.
Or are you calling Jack?

187
00:21:36,453 --> 00:21:41,004
- I don't think that's gonna help, either.
- Shut up. Shut up. Shut your mouth.

188
00:21:44,813 --> 00:21:47,407
- Operations.
- Jack Bauer.

189
00:21:47,493 --> 00:21:52,442
Clearance number Q22Q17. Pass me to
Senator Palmer's Secret Service liaison.

190
00:21:52,533 --> 00:21:56,572
- Hold, please.
- What do you want me to tell them?

191
00:21:56,653 --> 00:21:59,247
That you need priority clearance
at the breakfast.

192
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:02,166
- Frank Miller.
- Hey, Frank. It's Jack Bauer over at CTU.

193
00:22:02,253 --> 00:22:05,723
- I need priority clearance for the breakfast.
- We locked the list.

194
00:22:05,813 --> 00:22:08,771
- Open it up.
- I can't without approval from Command.

195
00:22:08,853 --> 00:22:12,641
Then call Command.
My clearance number is Q22Q17.

196
00:22:14,933 --> 00:22:18,209
All right. You'll be checking in
with Agent Pierce when you arrive.

197
00:22:18,293 --> 00:22:20,284
Thanks.

198
00:22:21,653 --> 00:22:26,169
OK. Now call Division.
Post yourself out for the next hour.

199
00:22:26,253 --> 00:22:31,691
Tell them you're going to the breakfast and
the investigation's making good progress.

200
00:22:44,093 --> 00:22:46,084
Rick.

201
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:49,608
Well... you were right.

202
00:22:49,693 --> 00:22:52,287
Gaines isn't lettin' me go yet.

203
00:22:53,653 --> 00:22:56,326
- So what are you gonna do?
- I don't know.

204
00:22:57,653 --> 00:23:00,213
Let's get outta here, Rick.

205
00:23:09,133 --> 00:23:12,011
We're here.
There's a fence here which is over that way.

206
00:23:12,093 --> 00:23:17,042
They got people everywhere, but I noticed
they're a little thin right around this area.

207
00:23:17,133 --> 00:23:19,124
Yo, Rick!

208
00:23:19,213 --> 00:23:21,204
Come here.

209
00:23:25,253 --> 00:23:28,131
- Get off of me!
- What the hell are you doin'?

210
00:23:30,573 --> 00:23:33,406
Give me five minutes, dude.
No one has to know.

211
00:23:37,373 --> 00:23:40,171
- I'll give you four.
- No, don't.

212
00:23:41,373 --> 00:23:43,364
I'll be outside.

213
00:23:51,013 --> 00:23:53,447
When I go back out,
I'll leave the door unlocked.

214
00:23:53,533 --> 00:23:55,683
I'll see his back is turned so you can get out.

215
00:23:55,773 --> 00:23:59,049
Go across the path behind the shed
and wait for me there.

216
00:23:59,133 --> 00:24:01,124
Be careful.

217
00:24:02,693 --> 00:24:04,684
- Sorry I hit you.
- No.

218
00:24:09,413 --> 00:24:11,404
No. Not true.

219
00:24:12,533 --> 00:24:14,524
Also not true.

220
00:24:15,813 --> 00:24:17,849
What's wrong?

221
00:24:19,933 --> 00:24:22,606
This isn't the same key card
I was working from before.

222
00:24:22,693 --> 00:24:25,571
- What makes you say that?
- It's giving me different data.

223
00:24:25,653 --> 00:24:29,885
- What?
- I was 20 per cent through this thing.

224
00:24:29,973 --> 00:24:33,727
- Now it's saying it's 99 per cent complete.
- Well, isn't that good?

225
00:24:33,813 --> 00:24:38,250
Yeah, if it were true, but I don't believe it.
This is a different key card.

226
00:24:38,333 --> 00:24:42,724
You've been sitting here this entire time.
Who could have switched it?

227
00:24:56,333 --> 00:24:58,688
I need to post out until eight.

228
00:24:58,773 --> 00:25:01,048
No, that won't be necessary.

229
00:25:01,133 --> 00:25:03,806
Yes, I'm reachable. Thank you. Bye.

230
00:25:03,893 --> 00:25:08,205
Nina, I can't talk right now.
There's an emergency down at Division.

231
00:25:08,293 --> 00:25:10,807
- Where's the key card?
- What?

232
00:25:10,893 --> 00:25:12,963
Careful, Jack.

233
00:25:13,773 --> 00:25:17,812
Somebody replaced the key card
Walsh gave you with this one.

234
00:25:18,293 --> 00:25:20,932
- Who?
- Milo thinks it was you.

235
00:25:25,213 --> 00:25:29,252
- Jack?
- What are you talking about?

236
00:25:29,333 --> 00:25:34,202
The only time Milo took his eyes
off the system was when you distracted him.

237
00:25:39,333 --> 00:25:42,769
OK, you're right.
I just didn't wanna alarm anyone.

238
00:25:42,853 --> 00:25:46,892
Division got some information.
They didn't trust Milo with it.

239
00:25:46,973 --> 00:25:49,646
Where's the key card, Jack?

240
00:25:53,853 --> 00:25:55,844
Take care of this, Jack.

241
00:25:57,693 --> 00:26:00,571
Give it to me, Jack, or I'll call Division myself.

242
00:26:00,653 --> 00:26:03,531
Fine. There's the key card.

243
00:26:06,693 --> 00:26:09,002
What are you doing?

244
00:26:10,373 --> 00:26:12,807
I'm sorry, Nina. I'm sorry.

245
00:26:13,933 --> 00:26:17,005
But, believe me, I will kill you if I have to.

246
00:26:17,613 --> 00:26:19,968
Now, no screaming.

247
00:26:22,093 --> 00:26:24,687
Get her out of there now!

248
00:26:26,413 --> 00:26:28,927
- Put this on.
- Jack, I don't understand.

249
00:26:29,013 --> 00:26:31,083
- Why are you...?
- Nina, don't talk.

250
00:26:31,173 --> 00:26:34,563
I will explain everything
as soon as we get out of here.

251
00:26:35,973 --> 00:26:37,964
Nice and quiet.

252
00:26:41,413 --> 00:26:43,404
Open the door.

253
00:27:12,133 --> 00:27:16,445
- Where are you guys going?
- Division set up a meeting between agencies.

254
00:27:16,533 --> 00:27:18,922
Nina will brief you when she gets back.

255
00:27:46,973 --> 00:27:48,964
Jack, where are you taking me?

256
00:27:49,053 --> 00:27:51,283
Just start the car and drive.

257
00:28:17,933 --> 00:28:18,968
- Hello?
- Jack.

258
00:28:19,053 --> 00:28:22,045
- Who?
- My husband, Jack Bauer. It's urgent.

259
00:28:22,133 --> 00:28:25,091
- This phone was lying on the ground.
- Where are you?

260
00:28:25,173 --> 00:28:28,404
- St Mark's Hospital, the parking lot.
- Did anything happen there?

261
00:28:28,493 --> 00:28:32,042
- Not that I saw. Shall I call the cops?
- No. No.

262
00:28:44,333 --> 00:28:46,324
Oh, come on.

263
00:28:49,573 --> 00:28:51,211
- CTU.
- Who is this?

264
00:28:51,293 --> 00:28:54,444
- It's Jamey. Who's this?
- It's Teri Bauer. Is Jack there?

265
00:28:54,533 --> 00:28:57,923
- He just left with Nina.
- Is he OK? He lost his cellphone.

266
00:28:58,013 --> 00:29:02,086
- I thought something might have happened.
- He seemed fine. Can I help you, Teri?

267
00:29:02,173 --> 00:29:04,767
Yeah. I'm in trouble
and so is my daughter Kim.

268
00:29:04,853 --> 00:29:07,321
OK. Wait, wait. Slow down.
Tell me what's wrong.

269
00:29:07,413 --> 00:29:09,529
- Kimberly's been kidnapped.
- My God.

270
00:29:09,613 --> 00:29:12,127
- They tried to take me too.
- Did you call the police?

271
00:29:12,213 --> 00:29:15,444
Jack says they can't be involved
or we'll risk Kimberly's life.

272
00:29:15,533 --> 00:29:18,411
Tell me where you are
so I can send someone to pick you up.

273
00:29:18,493 --> 00:29:22,725
OK. I'm on Mulholland,
about a mile east of Coldwater.

274
00:29:22,813 --> 00:29:24,804
- Jamey, tell them to hurry.
- OK.

275
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:32,088
OK, we're coming up on the hour.

276
00:29:32,173 --> 00:29:35,722
It's about the time the polls are about to open.
Not that far off now.

277
00:29:35,813 --> 00:29:37,610
I wanna remind everyone...

278
00:29:37,693 --> 00:29:41,049
You look handsome. Presidential.

279
00:29:42,813 --> 00:29:46,169
- Where's Keith?
- He's, uh... still in his room.

280
00:29:47,493 --> 00:29:50,326
We don't have much time.

281
00:29:50,413 --> 00:29:52,290
David.

282
00:29:54,373 --> 00:29:58,491
What if Maureen could be persuaded
not to come forward with the story?

283
00:29:59,173 --> 00:30:01,812
I already spoke to her. There's no way.

284
00:30:02,773 --> 00:30:04,764
There's always a way.

285
00:30:07,573 --> 00:30:11,885
- What are you getting at?
- Maureen is just like everybody else.

286
00:30:11,973 --> 00:30:17,286
She's got a past. What if there was something
in her past that she wanted to keep there?

287
00:30:18,373 --> 00:30:21,968
- You mean blackmail?
- I don't care what you call it.

288
00:30:22,053 --> 00:30:25,807
I'm just trying to save our son.
And your candidacy.

289
00:30:27,333 --> 00:30:29,563
You've been talking to Carl.

290
00:30:29,653 --> 00:30:32,042
You left me no choice.

291
00:30:32,133 --> 00:30:34,408
No one has to know what happened.

292
00:30:34,493 --> 00:30:40,045
I'd know. We would know.
After everything we've been through tonight,

293
00:30:40,133 --> 00:30:44,570
- how can you justify burying the truth?
- Because it's been buried for seven years.

294
00:30:44,653 --> 00:30:50,011
And digging it up is not going to change
the fact that it's already happened.

295
00:30:50,413 --> 00:30:52,404
You think about it.

296
00:31:24,213 --> 00:31:27,489
Well, I can't say this gig
doesn't have its benefits.

297
00:31:27,573 --> 00:31:33,170
Dude, you're lucky. If Gaines caught you
with her... Bang! You're dead.

298
00:31:33,693 --> 00:31:37,606
Yeah, well, Gaines didn't
catch me, did he? Come on.

299
00:31:40,053 --> 00:31:42,521
So, how long you been working with Gaines?

300
00:31:42,613 --> 00:31:45,081
I don't know. On and off, a couple of months.

301
00:31:45,173 --> 00:31:47,926
- Is he good for his word?
- What do you mean?

302
00:31:48,013 --> 00:31:50,686
Is he going to pay me, let me go,
if I do what he wants?

303
00:31:50,773 --> 00:31:52,525
- Sure.
- I don't know.

304
00:31:52,613 --> 00:31:55,571
I get the feeling he doesn't like me.
Here. Here you go.

305
00:31:55,653 --> 00:32:00,602
Yeah. He gets uptight when he's on a job.
But he's really pretty chilly.

306
00:32:00,693 --> 00:32:03,207
- You do the job, you'll be OK.
- Cool.

307
00:32:05,333 --> 00:32:08,166
So how was she? Sweet?

308
00:32:08,253 --> 00:32:10,244
Yeah, she was OK.

309
00:32:11,173 --> 00:32:16,486
Well, she's pretty hot.
Might wanna dip in myself.

310
00:32:16,573 --> 00:32:21,363
What about the lecture you just gave me?
Aren't we supposed to be loading the trucks?

311
00:32:26,413 --> 00:32:30,008
All right. Let's go.
Gaines really wants to get this done.

312
00:32:43,533 --> 00:32:47,128
- What are we loading?
- Everything. We're cleaning the place out.

313
00:32:47,213 --> 00:32:50,046
Oh, man, my keys. I'll catch up with you.

314
00:32:58,533 --> 00:33:00,922
- Did anyone see you?
- No. We're cool.

315
00:33:01,013 --> 00:33:03,846
When we get to the fence
you'll see a cluster of trees.

316
00:33:03,933 --> 00:33:06,128
That's where we wanna be. Ready?

317
00:33:06,213 --> 00:33:08,443
Yeah. Let's go.

318
00:33:12,373 --> 00:33:15,126
Hi. Hi.

319
00:33:15,573 --> 00:33:17,291
- Mrs. Bauer?
- Yes, hi. Teri.

320
00:33:17,373 --> 00:33:19,841
- Charles McLemore, CTU.
- You guys got here fast.

321
00:33:19,933 --> 00:33:22,811
- They told us it was urgent.
- Someone's got my daughter.

322
00:33:22,893 --> 00:33:26,647
This man knows where she is.
Has anyone been in touch with Jack yet?

323
00:33:26,733 --> 00:33:30,123
This guy's dangerous. What are you doing?

324
00:33:30,693 --> 00:33:32,206
No! No!

325
00:33:32,853 --> 00:33:35,811
- Let's hurry this up. We're way behind.
- No! No!

326
00:33:35,893 --> 00:33:38,248
Put her in the car.

327
00:33:46,613 --> 00:33:48,604
Jamey.

328
00:33:51,373 --> 00:33:54,888
- What's up?
- Got a confirm on a jurisdiction meeting?

329
00:33:55,573 --> 00:33:57,768
I haven't checked. Why?

330
00:33:57,853 --> 00:34:01,243
Nina was supposed to brief me,
but she's not back yet or on her cell.

331
00:34:01,333 --> 00:34:04,086
Plus there's nothing on my screen about it.

332
00:34:05,933 --> 00:34:09,209
It's not coming up on mine either,
but that doesn't mean anything.

333
00:34:09,293 --> 00:34:11,284
The lockdown made the system glitchy.

334
00:34:11,373 --> 00:34:13,807
That's probably why
the meeting's not posting.

335
00:34:13,893 --> 00:34:16,691
It's strange, the way she and Jack left.

336
00:34:18,173 --> 00:34:22,371
- Something happened in his office.
- What were you doing? Spying on them?

337
00:34:22,453 --> 00:34:25,092
Pull the security video from Jack's office.

338
00:34:25,173 --> 00:34:27,289
I'm not authorised to do that.

339
00:34:27,373 --> 00:34:31,525
I'm authorising you.
Jack and Nina aren't here. I got rank.

340
00:34:31,613 --> 00:34:34,525
- Yeah, but...
- Give me ten minutes, starting at 6.30.

341
00:34:34,613 --> 00:34:36,604
Send it to my screen.

342
00:34:52,093 --> 00:34:54,084
- Where are we going?
- Turn right.

343
00:34:54,173 --> 00:34:56,164
Turn right.

344
00:35:10,493 --> 00:35:15,521
All night you've been giving me this line that
somebody in the agency wants Palmer dead,

345
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:19,970
that your daughter's missing,
that no one can be trusted, not even me.

346
00:35:20,973 --> 00:35:23,362
Is it all a lie, Jack, or just some of it?

347
00:35:25,933 --> 00:35:28,766
What was on the key card
that you didn't want us to find?

348
00:35:28,853 --> 00:35:32,323
Please, Nina, don't make this harder than it is.

349
00:35:34,653 --> 00:35:38,532
You've got a gun on me, Jack.
I don't see how it gets much worse.

350
00:35:38,613 --> 00:35:42,572
Stay on Jefferson.
In about three miles you'll see a turn-off.

351
00:35:44,973 --> 00:35:47,362
Keep going straight.

352
00:35:49,453 --> 00:35:51,887
To think that I ever trusted you, Jack.

353
00:35:52,533 --> 00:35:54,683
- That I defended you.
- Watch out!

354
00:35:58,093 --> 00:36:00,368
Careful, Jack.

355
00:36:01,173 --> 00:36:03,164
I need you alive.

356
00:36:05,613 --> 00:36:07,604
Come on. Let's go.

357
00:36:36,013 --> 00:36:38,208
Stop the car.

358
00:36:38,293 --> 00:36:41,205
What is this place, Jack?
What are we doing here?

359
00:36:41,293 --> 00:36:43,568
- Somebody followed us.
- I know.

360
00:36:43,653 --> 00:36:46,121
- Who are they?
- What do you want me to do here?

361
00:36:46,213 --> 00:36:48,932
- What?
- Take her out and shoot her.

362
00:36:49,013 --> 00:36:52,085
- No.
- Your choice, Jack. Nina or your daughter.

363
00:36:53,093 --> 00:36:56,051
Jack, I don't understand.
Why are you doing this?

364
00:36:56,133 --> 00:36:58,328
Get out of the car.

365
00:36:58,733 --> 00:37:00,724
Get out of the car!

366
00:37:06,893 --> 00:37:09,885
Get out of the car. Get out of the car!

367
00:37:09,973 --> 00:37:11,691
- Jack, what...?
- I'm sorry, Nina.

368
00:37:11,773 --> 00:37:14,048
What are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do?

369
00:37:14,133 --> 00:37:18,763
- Ow! You're gonna kill me right here?
- I have no choice. They have Kim and Teri.

370
00:37:18,853 --> 00:37:21,651
How do you know they won't kill them
even if you do this?

371
00:37:21,733 --> 00:37:23,883
- I can't take that chance.
- What about me?

372
00:37:23,973 --> 00:37:27,568
Enough chitchat. Just do it.
Kimberly's dead if you don't do it!

373
00:37:27,653 --> 00:37:29,962
- Forgive me.
- You think I'm messing with you?

374
00:37:30,053 --> 00:37:32,169
- Turn around. Turn around!
- No. No.

375
00:37:32,253 --> 00:37:34,448
- If you do it, do it to my face.
- Shoot her!

376
00:37:34,533 --> 00:37:37,525
I won't make this easy for...

377
00:38:01,413 --> 00:38:03,404
Get back in the car, Jack.

378
00:38:57,053 --> 00:38:59,772
- What do we do when we get out?
- We have to get to the road.

379
00:38:59,853 --> 00:39:03,926
Highway 14's about a mile away,
and I know how to get there. You ready?

380
00:39:04,013 --> 00:39:06,004
Yeah.

381
00:39:12,213 --> 00:39:15,364
- What's the matter?
- Oh, my God! Where's my daughter?

382
00:39:15,453 --> 00:39:18,763
- Is she here?
- That's my mom.

383
00:39:18,853 --> 00:39:22,846
- We can't wait. We gotta go.
- I can't just leave her there.

384
00:39:22,933 --> 00:39:26,084
Kimberly! Is my daughter here?

385
00:39:26,173 --> 00:39:28,164
- What have you done with her?
- We gotta go!

386
00:39:28,253 --> 00:39:30,164
I can't.

387
00:39:31,333 --> 00:39:35,008
Get down. Kim, if we get out, we can help her.
We can call the police.

388
00:39:35,093 --> 00:39:37,084
You go. Call my dad.

389
00:39:47,413 --> 00:39:49,324
Yeah, right there.

390
00:39:49,413 --> 00:39:53,292
You just blew our only chance
to get outta here. Let's go.

391
00:39:53,373 --> 00:39:55,523
Come on.

392
00:39:57,613 --> 00:39:59,365
Come on.

393
00:40:09,853 --> 00:40:13,289
Stop it! Kimberly!

394
00:40:13,373 --> 00:40:18,083
The polls are about to open in California,
which is a key state for the Palmer campaign.

395
00:40:18,173 --> 00:40:21,643
Earlier polls show the senator
leading by a 15 per cent margin.

396
00:40:21,733 --> 00:40:25,328
Assuming voting follows predictions,
the senator...

397
00:40:31,813 --> 00:40:33,804
Jack, you son of a bitch.

398
00:40:46,013 --> 00:40:48,402
Why'd he give her a flak jacket?
