4
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:13,290
Previously on 24

5
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:14,790
What the hell is this?

6
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:16,910
All our screens for the
eastern quadrant are locked.

7
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:19,000
I took out your control units.

8
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:22,040
I want you to see what we can do.

9
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:23,610
Get ready to make the course change.

10
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:26,270
Gsa 1-1-7, thiss
northeast three control.

11
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:27,660
Go ahead, air traffic control.

12
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,720
We have a new runway assignment for you.

13
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:31,910
Sid, there's another plane,
landing on four-right.

14
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:33,370
It crosses
three-one-left.

15
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:36,920
Gsa 1-1-7, pull up.
Four-right, pull up.

16
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:41,040
That was just a warning shot.

17
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:43,470
Whatever we do next, it'll be the real thing.

18
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:45,330
Get the module ready.

19
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:47,610
As promised.

20
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:49,900
General juma will be pleased.

21
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:54,860
To make your demands known to president taylor.

22
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:56,060
Make the preparations.

23
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:59,280
Your government is about to
pay a very steep price for...

24
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,710
interfering in our affairs.

25
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:04,210
They assumed my son killed himself.

26
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:06,160
They didn't look deeply enough at anything.

27
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:08,790
The authorities have already
questioned your son's girlfriend, sir.

28
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,700
You're not going anywhere till I get the truth.

29
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:11,390
Sir!

30
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,590
You know who murdered my son.

31
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,920
He killed himself.

32
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:19,530
I'm going to find out what you're
hiding, and when I do, god help you.

33
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,140
You're right, he's not one of ours.

34
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:24,190
We'll follow him, see if it
leads us back to almeida. Dornan.

35
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,240
That's not the right move.

36
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:28,660
You can't bring anyone else into this.

37
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:29,930
What the hell's going on?

38
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:33,580
We're following up on a lead and I will
fill you in if and when we find something.

39
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:36,500
I don't like this. I just...
flat out lied to my boss.

40
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:38,120
I told you I would help you find tony almeida,

41
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:40,440
but you're going to have to let me do it my way.

42
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:44,490
Tony! Stop!

43
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:52,370
the device is gone.

44
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:53,990
The locater files have been deleted.

45
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,070
Where is it?

46
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,370
What the hell happened to you?

47
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:09,710
The following takes place between 10 am and 11 am

48
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:12,300
Where's almeida now?

49
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:14,290
He's in transit to fbi headquarters.

50
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,950
He'll be formally interrogated there.

51
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:18,890
I don't understand. Almeida
was orchestrating these attacks.

52
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:22,280
If he doesn't have the cip device, who does?

53
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:25,520
The fbi has learned that almeida
handed off the device to someone else.

54
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,000
They don't know who.

55
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:29,420
I may have an answer to that
question, madame president.

56
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,950
I'm listening.

57
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:33,260
Almeida's working for the juma regime.

58
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,190
Approximately five minutes ago, an audio message
was routed to the state department's subnet.

59
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:38,990
It's from colonel ike dubaku.

60
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,450
He's juma's right-hand man.

61
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,250
He's known as the "butcher of sangala."

62
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:44,140
Over 300,000 people were murdered...

63
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:46,350
I know who he is.

64
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,690
What did the message say?

65
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,690
I think you should hear it yourself.

66
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:56,410
President taylor, this is colonel ike dubaku.

67
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:03,800
You have no doubt confirmed, the near-collision
at jfk international was no accident.

68
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:07,370
We have the cip device.

69
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:12,910
We have the capability to kill
tens of thousands of americans,

70
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:16,130
and we are prepared to do so.

71
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:21,720
We demand the complete and immediate
withdrawal of the U. S. Naval strike

72
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:27,050
force to a position west of the
23rd meridian, by this time tomorrow.

73
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:30,150
In order to meet this timeline,

74
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:33,910
we require satellite confirmation
within three hours that

75
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:38,120
the carrier air wing is in full retreat.

76
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:45,530
Don't sacrifice your fellow
countrymen, madame president.

77
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:51,150
Allow the people of sangala
to determine their own destiny.

78
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,090
Stand your forces down.

79
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,800
Voice print's an 89% match. It's
dubaku. There's little doubt.

80
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:01,350
It looks like your suspicions
were correct, madame president.

81
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:03,050
This is about africa.

82
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:07,720
My god... dubaku should've been
tried for war crimes years ago.

83
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:10,040
Now he's giving us ultimatums.

84
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:13,220
We cannot let this monster
hold our country hostage.

85
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,530
Where do we stand on the planes?

86
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:16,480
There are still 2,500 planes in the air.

87
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:20,830
We have got to shore up the firewall, so
that the cip device will be rendered useless.

88
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:23,510
We now think we can re-engineer
the code in six days.

89
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:26,330
Six days? We don't have the luxury of six hours.

90
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,290
I'm sorry, madame president,

91
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:30,910
but there's no way we can rebuild
the firewall in that time frame.

92
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:41,020
I want you to instigate a series of restricted
alerts, keep it to first responders only.

93
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,220
We want people to be ready
in case we're attacked again,

94
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,620
but we don't want to start a panic.

95
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,670
Yes, madame president.

96
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:51,500
And, gentlemen, almeida is our only lead.

97
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:53,510
Make sure the fbi is aware of the demands.

98
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,440
Th need to work almeida from the africa side,
and they need to know, weon't have a lot of time.

99
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:59,700
Yes, ma'am.

100
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:30,840
Come out, keep your head down.

101
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:47,910
Get him ready for questioning.

102
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:54,730
I want an explanation.

103
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:58,580
You went after that shooter without backup or
authorization, and then refused to tell me why.

104
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,720
Now I want to know.

105
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:02,100
We didn't know who might be listening.

106
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:04,850
- Someone in this office is helping almeida.
- What?

107
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:08,090
The fbi has been compromised,
larry. There's a leak.

108
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:11,330
Based on what? Excuse me! This is private.

109
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:14,450
Tony knew that we were going to
schector's office before we even got there.

110
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:16,870
That's how he managed to get a sniper in position.

111
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,380
The tip had to come from your office,

112
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:21,360
and whoever it was helped schector's
assassin get out of the building.

113
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,990
He's right, larry. That's
why we couldn't tell you.

114
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,660
You've got a full perimeter,
right? Covered every exit?

115
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:29,350
How else do you think he got out of there?

116
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:34,540
All right, assuming this is true,
you got any idea who it could be?

117
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:36,550
No. We didn't see him, but
we know that it went down.

118
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,690
It could be anyone in the bureau.

119
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,360
You need to tighten your circle around tony.

120
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:45,210
You can't let any information that he gives
you get back to thpeople he's working with.

121
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,730
Otherwise, you'll never get that cip device.

122
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,520
All right.

123
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:57,170
we'll limit access to level
four clearance and above.

124
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:01,280
Have janis run the security protocols.
See if she can track down this leak.

125
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:04,310
This is moss.

126
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:08,220
Yeah, I'll take it in my office. Yeah.

127
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,430
It's the white house.

128
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:18,310
From now on, keep me in the loop.

129
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:22,010
And he doesn't do a damn thing without telling me.

130
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:29,440
We had to tell him, we had no choice.

131
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:31,720
Do you trust him?

132
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:34,700
No question. There's no one I trust more.

133
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:38,720
Where they going to hall tony?

134
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:44,950
I am going have to lift up your shirt.

135
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:00,920
Is that comfortable for you?

136
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:05,590
I'll take that as a yes.

137
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,500
- Is he hooked up?
- Yeah, we're ready to go.

138
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,330
Janis, I'll run the session.

139
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:21,360
I want you to handle something else.

140
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:24,300
- What else?
- Plugging a security leak.

141
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:27,240
What?

142
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:30,290
We think someone in this
office has been helping almeida.

143
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,330
We've kicked this up to level four clearance.

144
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:35,080
I want you to vet all
communication and information flow.

145
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:37,750
Red-tag every data point
that has to do with almeida.

146
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,630
Okay. Well, do we have any idea who it is?

147
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:43,460
- No, we don'T. I'm hoping you can help us find out.
- Okay.

148
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:49,110
Okay, there's a point-two deviation
on the blood pressure monitor,

149
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:51,180
and you're going to have to compensate for that.

150
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,460
Thanks, janis.

151
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:11,100
I'm sorry about your friend, jack.

152
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:14,560
I know you were hoping he wasn't
capable of doing something like this.

153
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,440
Yeah.

154
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:36,980
Hey, what's going on? Why
are we in level four lockdown?

155
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:38,370
Don't worry about it, just do your job.

156
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:41,590
How am I supposed to do my job when I can't get
through to half the server nodes in the building?

157
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,210
You're sifting through the evidence
gathered at almeida's arrest site,

158
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:47,160
that does not require level four clearance.

159
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:49,910
You have everything you
need to do yourork. Please.

160
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:13,020
it's confirmed--
the fbi has almeida.

161
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:16,840
- Then we should move on. There's nothing we can do.
- No.

162
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:19,470
We have assets inside the bureau.
We use them to help get him out.

163
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,800
No, it's too risky.

164
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,710
We'd be jeopardizing the entire
mission. Almeida's not that important.

165
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,250
What about the next operation?
Tony's prepped, he's ready to go.

166
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,760
We'll just have to find someone else.

167
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:30,400
I realize you and tony are friends.

168
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,840
I don't like throwing him to
the wolves anymore than you do,

169
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:35,670
but he knew what he was getting into.

170
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:38,750
I just spoke with juma.

171
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,180
The american troops are still
in position near our country.

172
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,090
Tell juma to be patient.

173
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:46,140
President taylor just received your demands.

174
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,960
Then perhaps it is time for
a more forceful demonstration.

175
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:50,890
If it comes to that, we'll be ready.

176
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:54,680
For now, let's give the white
house a little more time to respond.

177
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:01,450
For now.

178
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,210
Agent walker.

179
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,590
almeida's working for the juma regime.

180
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,610
What are you talking about?

181
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,450
The president just received a set of demands.

182
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:25,250
They're from colonel ike dubaku.

183
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:25,830
Dubaku.

184
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,650
Looks like he contracted
almeida to build the cip module.

185
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:32,020
Now, he's using it to blackmail the white house.

186
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:34,110
How?

187
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:35,390
Excuse me?

188
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:38,380
How is he going to blackmail the white house?

189
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:42,670
By insisting we stand down the
invasion force off the coast of sangala.

190
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:45,350
If the president doesn't comply with his demands,

191
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:48,740
dubaku's going to start killing americans.

192
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,670
I can get you your cip device.

193
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:54,480
Just let me talk to him.

194
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:57,730
I know him, I know how he thinks.

195
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,750
We have a history. I can use it against him.

196
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,860
He's gotten us this far, larry. It makes sense.

197
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:09,200
You're running out of time.

198
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:12,010
You don't have a better option.

199
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:40,410
give us the room.

200
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:52,140
I watched you die in my arms.

201
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:56,360
You want to explain to me how you're still alive?

202
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:03,010
Didn't think so.

203
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:05,430
Why don't I tell you what I know.

204
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:09,060
I know that you're working for the juma regime.

205
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:10,890
The white house just got their demands.

206
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:14,820
And you have to know that I
will never let that happen.

207
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:20,320
So why don't you save yourself some time...

208
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:24,660
and some pain.

209
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:27,810
And tell me where the cip device is.

210
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:30,740
I can't tell you that, jack.

211
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:34,240
Damn it, tony, you are not just
facing charges for domestic terrorism.

212
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:37,970
You are going to face international
charges for aiding and abetting a genocide.

213
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:40,890
They will give you the death penalty.

214
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:43,030
Come on, just work with me on this.

215
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,220
I can help you cut a deal. I
can maybe even get you immunity.

216
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:48,280
You're wasting your breath, jack.

217
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:52,960
If I were you, I'd tell the president to
withdraw those troops because dubaku's serious.

218
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:56,410
He's ready to take out thousands of
american lives unless his dands are met.

219
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:59,330
Why the hell are you doing this?

220
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:03,650
Juma wanted the cip module and
he was willing to pay for it.

221
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:10,010
I don't believe you.

222
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:14,150
Oh, come on, jack. Don't act so surprised.

223
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:18,590
Money's the only reason I
have left for doing anything.

224
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:20,180
The government took care of that.

225
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:22,100
The government did not kill michelle.

226
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:23,590
Charles logan did.

227
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,650
Charles logan is a product of his environment.

228
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:29,900
The government poisons everything in its path.

229
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:33,350
But you know that better than me,
jack. Look what they did to you.

230
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,100
Damn it, tony. We are not talking about me.

231
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:38,540
Oh, we're not?

232
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:41,800
You're asking me why I'm doing this.

233
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:43,760
I could ask you the same question.

234
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:47,180
Here you are working for the same
people that want to put you in prison.

235
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,820
The same peoplwho killed everything
you love and left you with nothing.

236
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,430
Your daughter wants nothing to do with you,

237
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,680
- teri's dead.
- Shut up.

238
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:55,780
- Audrey raines might...
- I said shut up!

239
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:58,510
Jack, no! You need to hear this!

240
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,650
You need to start living in the real world!

241
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:05,020
Because every second you help the
government, you're spitting on teri's grave!

242
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:09,270
Get up!

243
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,870
- He's losing it.
- Hold on.

244
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,540
Tell me where the device is!

245
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,770
So help me god, I will kill you.

246
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,700
And you will stay dead this time.

247
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,750
Where is the device?

248
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:24,720
last chance.

249
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:29,990
Where is it? Where is it?

250
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:35,800
Deep sky, jack.

251
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,170
- What did you just say?
- Son of a bitch.

252
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,120
Give him a few more seconds.

253
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:40,810
A few more seconds, he'll be dead.

254
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,730
Deep sky.

255
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,900
Jack, let him go!

256
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:48,160
Get him out of here!

257
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:52,090
get him out of here now!

258
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:56,690
I need a medic in here to check him out.

259
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:09,610
Keep an eye on him.

260
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:13,500
Deep sky.

261
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:23,460
Hello.

262
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,820
This is jack bauer.

263
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:29,250
Yes.

264
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:31,630
- I was told to call you.
- By whom?

265
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,650
Tony almeida.

266
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:39,270
He gave me this old ctu emergency phone code.

267
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:41,140
Deep sky.

268
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:46,840
It's bill, jack.

269
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:49,020
Bill, what the hell's going on?

270
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:50,240
Where is tony?

271
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:52,830
Fbi headquarters, he's been arrested.

272
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:56,670
- Arrested?
- He orchestrated a terrorist attack on the united states today.

273
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:58,600
I was interrogating him.

274
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:01,130
How'd you get involved in this?

275
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:03,600
The fbi brought me in to help track him down.

276
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:06,000
We need to talk, jack.

277
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:07,790
I'll call you back on a secure vpn line.

278
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,360
Bill, what the hell is going on?

279
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:10,830
I need ten minutes to set up the vpn...

280
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,570
I don't have ten minutes.

281
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:14,120
Ten minutes, jack.

282
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,240
I can't believe this.

283
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:24,540
If tony's been arrested, it's over.

284
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,900
Are you going to tell jack everything?

285
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,560
If we want to get tony back
undercover, we'll need his help.

286
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:33,840
I don't think jack's in a
very helpful frame of mind.

287
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:36,750
He's our only hope.

288
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:52,390
Hello, henry.

289
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:54,780
Ethan. I got your message about sangala.

290
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,010
Where's allison?

291
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:57,790
She's in her office.

292
00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:59,480
Henry.

293
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,480
The president is in an
impossible situation right now.

294
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:08,690
She needs your support.

295
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:14,220
But you can't give it to her if you keep going
off on these paranoid fantasies about roger.

296
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:17,550
I know about samantha roth. I
know you accosted her her office.

297
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:20,990
She's hiding something about my son's murder.

298
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:23,690
Roger wasn't murdered.

299
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,445
He committed suicide.

300
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:29,090
The coroner's office made that
determination, and then the fbi confirmed it.

301
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:31,510
They didn't look hard enough.

302
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:33,470
Ethan, I know my son.

303
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,260
He did not kill himself.

304
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:37,430
He wasn't depressed. He had no reason...

305
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:38,780
what if he did have a reason?

306
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:40,470
I would have known.

307
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,070
Not if he didn't tell you.

308
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:45,560
Not if he was too ashamed
to tell you or the president.

309
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:47,540
What are you talking about?

310
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:52,440
Roger was about to be investigated
by the sec for insider trading.

311
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:58,200
He'd used information he could only have
gotten through his access to the president.

312
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:03,560
Before the sec opened the
investigation, he killed himself.

313
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:06,210
I don't believe it.

314
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:08,230
It's all in here.

315
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,720
In the sec case file.

316
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:15,160
Why is this the first time I'm hearing about this?

317
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:20,020
Frank boylan agreed to bury the case
as a political favor to the president.

318
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:22,920
My wife knew about this and she didn't tell me?

319
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:24,710
She wanted to.

320
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,990
But she also wanted to protect
your memory of your son.

321
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:30,720
- You were in so much pain.
- Damn it, ethan, he was my son!

322
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:31,830
I deserved the truth!

323
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,090
And keeping it from you was a terrible mistake.

324
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:36,420
I realize that now.

325
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:40,510
But the president and i both thought
you were moving on with your life.

326
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:45,340
Mr. Kanin, the president wants to see you.

327
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:51,240
Does she know you're telling me this now?

328
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:53,610
No.

329
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,000
And I think it best we keep it that way.

330
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:59,590
At least till this crisis is resolved.

331
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:14,180
I felt I had to tell him, sir. I'm sorry.

332
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:23,770
All right, thank you.

333
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,570
Madame president, you wanted to see me?

334
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:32,770
Admiral smith laid out the
timeline for withdrawing our forces.

335
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:38,960
He's saying to meet dubaku's demands, we
need to order the pullback by 1:00 P. M.

336
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,200
That's not much time.

337
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,790
No, it isn'T.

338
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,950
Well, maybe this man, almeida, will
tell us where to find the cip device.

339
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:49,680
No, tim woods just heard from the bureau.

340
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,390
So far, almeida's refusing to cooperate.

341
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,370
Well, maybe he's just positioning for a deal.

342
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:56,060
Tim doesn't think so.

343
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,870
He said we shouldn't count on almeida to talk.

344
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:01,220
I see.

345
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,560
So...

346
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:08,020
unless I order our forces to stand down,

347
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:12,530
I'll be condemning innocent americans to death.

348
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:19,370
And if we capitulate, thousands
of sangalans will be slaughtered.

349
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,980
How did this happen, ethan?

350
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:33,620
How could we have been so caught off guard?

351
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:38,180
And now to have to decide
between two impossible choices.

352
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:45,910
Well, at least one of those choices does stands
a good chance of preserving american lives.

353
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,150
You mean withdrawal.

354
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,670
We are nearing the time when
we may have to consider it.

355
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,560
We're not there yet, ethan.

356
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,340
I can't discuss this.

357
00:21:56,410 --> 00:22:00,230
Not until we have explored every possible option.

358
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:04,920
Tell the fbi to keep working on almeida.

359
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:07,460
Yes, madame president.

360
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:19,410
Mr. Buchanan, I've got the secure line.

361
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:22,710
All right, dial the number.

362
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:29,240
bill, stop screwing around, tell
me what the hell is going on.

363
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:31,430
Jack, tony is not a terrorist.

364
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,430
He's working deep cover. He's working with me.

365
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:35,880
We have proof that he tried to
bring down two commercial airliners.

366
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:37,490
You don't know the whole story.

367
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:40,020
- That's part of an ongoing operation...
- operation?

368
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:43,450
What kind of an operation puts hundreds, if
not thousands, of lives in danger?

369
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:46,110
Jack, please. You need to listen.

370
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,620
Our government is corrupted.

371
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:52,120
There are people on the inside who are
actively aiding dubaku and the juma regime.

372
00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:58,210
The point is, tony was supposed to be
near the cip module the whole time.

373
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:03,130
With him in custody, we've lost our ability
to control it and to attack this conspiracy.

374
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:05,240
Who's a part of the conspiracy? Give me names.

375
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:06,500
We don't know the extent of it.

376
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:10,030
But we have reason to believe that members of
the president's inner council are on payroll.

377
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:12,010
Who's shepherding the investigation? Which agency?

378
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:14,370
That's just it, jack. There's no shepherd.

379
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:17,850
There's no agency. This
corruption runs deep and wide.

380
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:22,450
We're working outside the government that's
why we have to get tony back undercover.

381
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:24,780
He's at fbi headquarters, bill.

382
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:27,860
I never said it s going to
be easy. But we have to try.

383
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:32,150
Chloe's already into their system.

384
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:33,320
Chloe's working on this?

385
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:35,730
Hi, jack. It's good to hear your voice.

386
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:38,260
- Yeah, you, too.- I saw
the hearings on c-span.

387
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:40,670
I can't believe what the senator said to you.

388
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,910
You looked good though.

389
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,580
Jack, we need your help to get tony out of there.

390
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:48,690
There's an agent at the
fbi, renee walker. She could help.

391
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,810
No. No, the fbi's been compromised.

392
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,980
Somebody in the bureau is aiding dubaku.

393
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:54,790
You don't understand, bill, jack, I trust her.

394
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:59,140
If you think you need to use her to get
tony out of fbi headquarters, then do it.

395
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:01,340
But you'll be making her a target.

396
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:06,310
No, you're right. You're right, we'll do it your way.

397
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:09,070
I can get to tony myself, but chloe's
gonna have to get us out of the building.

398
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,490
We're already on it.

399
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:11,850
Get back to me as soon as you're ready.

400
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:14,870
I'm on my way, chloe.

401
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:38,550
hey, sean, you know those data-mining
plug-ins we downloaded last week?

402
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:40,410
Where did we file those?

403
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:44,450
Where did we file those?

404
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:47,230
Uh, yeah, file folder a-76.

405
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,190
- Do you need help with something?
- No. Why?

406
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:51,980
You seem confused.

407
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:55,820
I just don't like having to dance
around this level four lock-down.

408
00:24:56,010 --> 00:25:00,000
Oh, well, I thought you'd welcome the
opportunity to complain about something.

409
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:17,150
****

410
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,020
hello?

411
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:35,060
Mr. Taylor, it's samantha.

412
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:38,100
I was gointo call you.

413
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,360
I owe you an apology, sam.

414
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:43,770
I was wrong to confront you like that.

415
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,600
Uh, no.

416
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,250
You weren'T.

417
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:51,000
I wasn't completely honest with you.

418
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:52,680
What do you mean?

419
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,830
Roger didn't commit suicide, mr. Taylor.

420
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:59,430
He was murdered.

421
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,840
I need to see you. Ale.

422
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,770
Will you meet me?

423
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:11,450
Of course.

424
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:14,790
Where's the cip device, tony?

425
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,810
Who'd you give it to?

426
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:22,930
People you're taking money from.

427
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:26,160
I thought you'd might like to
see some of their handiwork.

428
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:34,980
U know how many people they've killed
since they went back into sangala?

429
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:40,410
200,000 and counting.

430
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:43,090
Most of them women and children.

431
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:44,580
Tony...

432
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:49,500
you really want this on your conscience?

433
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:57,500
My conscience is clear.

434
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:01,270
And nothing you can say or do will change that.

435
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,890
So why don't you do the smart thing and ll
president taylor to stand down the strike force,

436
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:10,840
because unless she does, planes
will be falling from the sky.

437
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:15,080
And then you'll have a whole
new batch of photos to look at.

438
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:20,700
Only this time, they'll be of dead americans.

439
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,860
Larry, we need to tal

440
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:42,120
almeida's not going to break.

441
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:44,840
- We don't know that.
- He's a trained ctu agent.

442
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,850
- Yeah.
- He's conducted interrogations just like this one.

443
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:50,500
There's nothing you can say to him that
he hasn't said himself a hundred times.

444
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:52,730
- So, what are you suggesting? We give up?
- No.

445
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:55,920
I'm suggesting we might need
a more forceful approach.

446
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:58,740
You mean torture.

447
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:01,770
No, there are methods of coercion that we
haven't even considered. Pharmaceuticals...

448
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:05,170
I can't believe you want
to have this conversation.

449
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:08,460
- You're not hearing the argument.
- The argument is crazy.

450
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:10,190
It's illegal.

451
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,650
And it's over. As a matter of
fact, I want bauer out of here.

452
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,350
He's a wildcard. He's dangerous. I
want him out of the building.

453
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:17,920
Go process him out. I will continue here.

454
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:20,910
Go! Go! Now!

455
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,920
renee, I was just about to call you.

456
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,600
I may have found the leak.

457
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:42,930
Someone did a runaround
on the level four lockdown.

458
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:46,750
They circumvented the security fence
and they hacked into the faa database.

459
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:48,100
- Faa? Are you sure?
- Positive.

460
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:49,350
I don't know what they were doing in there,

461
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:51,940
but they had to navigate some
very sophisticated tagger software.

462
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:53,570
- When was this?
- Just a few minutes ago.

463
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:56,030
- Any idea who it was?
- No, but I might be able to pull a user I. D.

464
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:57,240
- Directly out of the terminal.
- Okay, which terminal?

465
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,650
Mainframe room. Terminal three.

466
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,770
- Check it out. Let me know what you find.
- Okay.

467
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:07,140
Agent teller, I need you to prepare
a debriefing packet for jack bauer,

468
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:08,360
and bring me his personal effects.

469
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:11,280
- Okay, I'll bring 'em right to you.
- Thanks. I'll be in my office.

470
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,170
What are you doing?

471
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:05,720
What's the matter?

472
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:09,600
You just stay where you are.

473
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:13,330
Janis, stop it.

474
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:16,090
Would you just talk to me.

475
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:19,210
I know you've been helping tony almeida.

476
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:21,280
What? Are you crazy?

477
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:23,160
No. You broke into the faa database.

478
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,940
That's your server I. D.

479
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:27,400
Yeah, it's my server I. D.

480
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,690
, But I'm not helping the terrorist.

481
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:30,890
You want to know why I was in
there, I'll tell you. I was worried.

482
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:33,260
My wife is on one of those planes up there.

483
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:35,300
I had to see if her flight had been grounded yet.

484
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:37,830
You expect me toelieve that? Why
are you sneaking around?

485
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,860
Because of the level four lockdown, it
cut me out of the faa database.

486
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:43,270
I couldn't monitor her flight.

487
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:48,440
Look. See for yourself.

488
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:55,740
Flight 112 out of las vegas.

489
00:30:55,775 --> 00:30:57,287
Christina hillinger.

490
00:30:57,322 --> 00:30:58,800
You just stay there.

491
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:04,385
God, sean!

492
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:05,535
You scared the hell out of me!

493
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:07,015
Why wouldn't you just tell me that?

494
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:08,660
'Cause what I was doing was borderline illegal.

495
00:31:08,695 --> 00:31:10,465
I didn't want to get you in trouble.

496
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,180
Plus, you looked like you had enough on your plate.

497
00:31:12,215 --> 00:31:15,140
Damn I I told renee I'd found a security leak.

498
00:31:15,175 --> 00:31:16,920
Is that what's going on around here?

499
00:31:16,955 --> 00:31:17,955
There's a security leak?

500
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:21,590
Don't worry about it. Go back to
your station, keep this to yourself.

501
00:31:21,625 --> 00:31:23,730
And I will clean up your mess.

502
00:31:23,765 --> 00:31:25,090
Go.

503
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:31,930
Idiot.

504
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:36,775
Go ahead.

505
00:31:36,810 --> 00:31:38,145
Jack, agent walker is on her way.

506
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:40,130
She's heading down the corridor towards your room.

507
00:31:40,165 --> 00:31:41,835
Copy that.

508
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:43,175
How are you doing with the loops?

509
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:44,445
I'm dropping the first one in now.

510
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,420
I have a series of loops, I'm
going to drop them as you go.

511
00:31:47,455 --> 00:31:48,735
Security won't see a thing.

512
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:49,660
It's all right. I'll take it from here.

513
00:31:49,695 --> 00:31:51,977
Understand.

514
00:31:52,012 --> 00:31:54,260
Standing by.

515
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:04,595
I'm sorry, jack.

516
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:06,940
We're proceeding without you.

517
00:32:06,975 --> 00:32:09,190
Wasn't my decision.

518
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:12,300
We wouldn't have almeida without you.

519
00:32:12,335 --> 00:32:14,200
We owe you a lot.

520
00:32:14,235 --> 00:32:15,950
Thanks.

521
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:19,205
That paperwork for me?

522
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,330
You need to fill this out.

523
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:29,730
I want you to know I'm going to put in a
good word with the justice department for you.

524
00:32:29,765 --> 00:32:31,740
Maybe it'll help.

525
00:32:31,775 --> 00:32:33,640
Thanks.

526
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:36,450
Jack!

527
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:38,040
Don't fight it.

528
00:32:38,075 --> 00:32:39,430
Jack!

529
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:43,350
don't fight it!

530
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:17,435
Jack just took out agent walker.

531
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:18,920
He has her keycard and her weapon.

532
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:19,987
He's going to get tony.

533
00:33:20,022 --> 00:33:20,985
What's your location?

534
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:22,035
I'm about ten minutes out.

535
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:24,160
Did you get my rendezvous point?

536
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:27,410
Just showed up on my gps.

537
00:33:27,445 --> 00:33:28,695
Okay, great.

538
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:30,690
I've got to go, it's jack.

539
00:33:30,725 --> 00:33:32,255
Jack?

540
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:34,370
I'm ready. I've got access to interrogation one.

541
00:33:34,405 --> 00:33:35,852
What's bill's eta?

542
00:33:35,887 --> 00:33:37,300
About ten minutes.

543
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:39,530
How's the corridor?

544
00:33:39,565 --> 00:33:40,655
Clear.

545
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:42,690
Wait for my call.

546
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,825
Put your weapon down now!

547
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:55,900
What the hell do you think you're doing?

548
00:33:55,935 --> 00:33:58,395
I said do it now!

549
00:33:58,430 --> 00:34:01,190
- Do it or I will kill him.
- Okay, all right.

550
00:34:01,225 --> 00:34:03,320
Put it down. It's all right, do it.

551
00:34:03,355 --> 00:34:05,137
Slowly.

552
00:34:05,172 --> 00:34:06,920
Slowly!

553
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:10,285
Now you.

554
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,420
- Do it!
- All right.

555
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:21,210
Kick your weapon over to me.

556
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,440
- Come on!
- Okay, all right.

557
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:26,090
Uncuff him.

558
00:34:27,410 --> 00:34:28,810
Where's agent walker? What did you do to her?

559
00:34:28,845 --> 00:34:29,685
Shut up.

560
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:30,880
Bauer, you're not going to make it out of here.

561
00:34:30,915 --> 00:34:33,060
I said shut up!

562
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:36,175
I talked to bill.

563
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:37,545
- How much did he tell you?
- Enough.

564
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:39,170
We're going to get you out of here.

565
00:34:39,205 --> 00:34:40,725
Chloe's tapped into their security.

566
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:41,970
She's going to walk us out of this building.

567
00:34:42,005 --> 00:34:44,250
All you need to do is follow my lead.

568
00:34:44,285 --> 00:34:45,750
Chloe, it's jack. Do you copy?

569
00:34:45,785 --> 00:34:46,515
Copy, jack.

570
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:49,020
I got tony at the door of interrogation
one leading out to the hallway.

571
00:34:49,055 --> 00:34:49,675
Okay, I see you.

572
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:51,925
I'm going to direct you to the southwest exit.

573
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:54,355
Right now, you're in the least
populated area of the building,

574
00:34:54,390 --> 00:34:56,860
but you're going to run into a lot more
resistance before you get out of there.

575
00:34:56,895 --> 00:34:57,835
Copy that. You ready?

576
00:34:57,870 --> 00:35:00,230
- Clear to move.
- Let's go.

577
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:05,570
hold up, there's two people
coming out of the elevator.

578
00:35:05,605 --> 00:35:06,747
Copy that.

579
00:35:06,782 --> 00:35:07,890
Come on.

580
00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:18,845
Listen, jack, I'm sorry about
the stuff I said back there.

581
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:22,620
I just needed to get you close
enough to give you bill's code name.

582
00:35:22,655 --> 00:35:25,140
I'm just glad I didn't break your neck.

583
00:35:25,175 --> 00:35:28,630
Well, uh, you came close.

584
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:32,130
Yeah, sorry about that.

585
00:35:32,165 --> 00:35:33,242
Okay, clear.

586
00:35:33,277 --> 00:35:34,320
We're clear.

587
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:40,180
Let's go.

588
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:54,780
I cleaned up your trail, so we'll just
keep this little transgression between us,

589
00:35:54,815 --> 00:35:57,750
although I don't know what
I'm going to tell renee.

590
00:35:57,785 --> 00:35:59,150
Have you heard one thing I've just said?

591
00:35:59,185 --> 00:36:00,447
Yeah, yeah, that's fine.

592
00:36:00,482 --> 00:36:01,710
Take a look at this.

593
00:36:01,745 --> 00:36:03,300
What?

594
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:05,640
There's a performance hit
on one of our signal routers.

595
00:36:05,675 --> 00:36:08,750
It's down 0.7%.

596
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,910
You're right. Somebody is riding our bandwidth.

597
00:36:16,945 --> 00:36:18,480
Hacking in? Is that possible?

598
00:36:18,515 --> 00:36:19,775
With all the safeguards?

599
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:23,360
Anything is possible if
you know what you're doing.

600
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:26,445
They're inside our security sub-net.

601
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,070
They've accessed the surveillance system.

602
00:36:29,105 --> 00:36:30,250
What are you going to do?

603
00:36:30,285 --> 00:36:32,410
Lock them out.

604
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,780
Okay, jack, you're going to make
a left down the next hallway;

605
00:36:44,815 --> 00:36:46,805
thers an emergency stairwell at the end.

606
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,550
Will that stairwell get us
down to the ground level?

607
00:36:48,585 --> 00:36:49,325
Yes.

608
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,080
Copy that.

609
00:36:57,430 --> 00:36:59,085
Hold on.

610
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,475
What's wrong?

611
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:01,795
I lost my feed.

612
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:04,270
Chloe's feed just went down.

613
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:07,295
What'd you do?

614
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:09,460
I pinged the line and it automatically reset.

615
00:37:09,495 --> 00:37:10,605
Someone was hacking in.

616
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,960
They were taking out our surveillance cameras.

617
00:37:12,995 --> 00:37:14,900
Janis, take a look at this.

618
00:37:14,935 --> 00:37:16,610
Send it to me.

619
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,465
security, this is janis gold.

620
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:29,350
We have a code 12 in progress, we
need a team to interrogation one.

621
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:35,545
damn it.

622
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:37,000
We've got to keep moving.

623
00:37:37,035 --> 00:37:38,570
Let's go.

624
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:59,390
Security team is between
us and the southwest exit.

625
00:37:59,425 --> 00:38:01,072
Chloe, what have you got? We're boxed in.

626
00:38:01,107 --> 00:38:02,720
Someone at fbi is blocking my every move.

627
00:38:02,755 --> 00:38:04,387
It's really starting to piss me off.

628
00:38:04,422 --> 00:38:05,985
You need to get back into their system.

629
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:07,310
Otherwise, we're not going to make it out of here.

630
00:38:07,345 --> 00:38:09,720
Jack, I'm sorry, I'm trying.

631
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:28,980
We've got to make a move, jack.

632
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:30,750
I know.

633
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:34,390
Let's go. Now.

634
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:48,500
Come on, chloe, talk to me.

635
00:38:48,535 --> 00:38:49,215
I'm still locked out.

636
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:50,505
I'm trying to work around it.

637
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:52,170
Jack, we're sitting ducks if we stay here.

638
00:38:52,205 --> 00:38:53,770
I know.

639
00:38:54,770 --> 00:38:56,000
Chloe, we have to take the stairwell.

640
00:38:56,035 --> 00:38:57,210
We don't have a choice.

641
00:38:57,245 --> 00:38:59,010
Quietly.

642
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:04,980
Where are they?

643
00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:06,510
We're looking.

644
00:39:06,545 --> 00:39:07,570
Find them!

645
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:17,700
Are you all right?

646
00:39:17,735 --> 00:39:18,530
Uh, yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

647
00:39:18,565 --> 00:39:19,790
Are you okay?

648
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,770
They're still in the building. We're
trying to locate them.

649
00:39:21,805 --> 00:39:23,900
I can't believe this. What the hell is jack doing?

650
00:39:23,935 --> 00:39:25,560
He's helping his friend escape.

651
00:39:25,595 --> 00:39:26,580
That's what he's doing.

652
00:39:26,615 --> 00:39:27,845
I'm sorry, larry.

653
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,280
I shouldn't have trusted him.

654
00:39:29,315 --> 00:39:30,260
- All right.
- I got him!

655
00:39:30,295 --> 00:39:32,085
Southwest stairwell.

656
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,065
Security, this is agent moss.

657
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:37,625
Suspects are in the southwest
stairwell, descending past the fifth floor.

658
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:41,340
Lockdown the building perimeter, and deploy
two teams in the first floor service corridor.

659
00:39:41,375 --> 00:39:42,990
Be aware, the suspects arermed.

660
00:39:43,025 --> 00:39:44,700
We need them alive.

661
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:47,650
Okay, I'm back up, jack.

662
00:39:47,685 --> 00:39:49,260
Copy that.

663
00:39:51,930 --> 00:39:52,990
What was that?

664
00:39:53,025 --> 00:39:54,015
Hacker's back in.

665
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:56,030
Whoever this is, they're very good.

666
00:39:56,065 --> 00:39:57,170
Well, lock them out.

667
00:39:57,205 --> 00:39:58,880
I'm trying!

668
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:01,655
Jack, hold up.

669
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:02,545
What is it?

670
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:03,420
You're heading into an ambush.

671
00:40:03,455 --> 00:40:05,105
It's a six-man team.

672
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:06,920
They're heading up toward you in the stairwell.

673
00:40:06,955 --> 00:40:07,785
Understand. We'll evade.

674
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:09,630
They're coming up the stairs.

675
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,920
Pass me that fire extinguisher.

676
00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:28,450
We're on the roof of the parking lot.

677
00:40:28,485 --> 00:40:29,895
I see you. Good work.

678
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:30,990
Geo to the north end, jack.

679
00:40:31,025 --> 00:40:32,097
Bill's almost there.

680
00:40:32,132 --> 00:40:33,170
He's in a blue van.

681
00:40:33,205 --> 00:40:34,640
Copy that.

682
00:40:36,010 --> 00:40:37,890
They're outside. They went
through the third floor window.

683
00:40:37,925 --> 00:40:38,635
Let's go!

684
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:40,405
Perimeter team, they're in the parking garage.

685
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:43,760
Notify metro police. I want them to
cordon off a five block perimeter.

686
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:49,040
On the right! Get down!

687
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,120
we've got to get you out
of here and back undercover.

688
00:40:55,155 --> 00:40:56,060
I'll be right behind you.

689
00:40:56,095 --> 00:40:57,380
Go!

690
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:41,040
this is going to hurt.

691
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:00,510
tony, let's go!

692
00:42:03,570 --> 00:42:05,070
stay low, stay low.

693
00:42:05,105 --> 00:42:06,950
Come on, jack.

694
00:42:13,210 --> 00:42:15,110
go, bill.

695
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:27,955
Agent moss, they're gone.

696
00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:30,420
The got outside of the perimeter.

697
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:42,820
All right, chloe, I've got them.

698
00:42:42,855 --> 00:42:43,730
Any sign of pursuit?

699
00:42:43,765 --> 00:42:44,455
Not so far.

700
00:42:44,490 --> 00:42:47,180
They must still be mobilizing. We
caught them off guard.

701
00:42:47,215 --> 00:42:48,305
Traffic cams?

702
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:50,630
I'm cycling frequencies to clear a path now.

703
00:42:50,665 --> 00:42:51,865
Good.

704
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:52,775
Are you all right?

705
00:42:52,810 --> 00:42:53,970
I'm fine. Where are we going?

706
00:42:54,005 --> 00:42:55,545
It's not far.

707
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:58,140
Bill, I did what you wanted, I
got tony out of there.

708
00:42:58,175 --> 00:42:59,525
Tell me what the hell is going on.

709
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:01,985
When we get there, I'll tell you everything.
