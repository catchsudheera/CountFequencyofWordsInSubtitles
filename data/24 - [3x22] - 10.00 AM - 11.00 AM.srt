1
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,995
I just spoke to my source
at Keeler's headquarters.

2
00:00:17,123 --> 00:00:20,596
Sherry was there,
meeting privately with Keeler.

3
00:00:20,727 --> 00:00:23,687
- Meeting Keeler about what?
-

4
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:28,444
I came here because I can guarantee you
a win in November.

5
00:00:28,574 --> 00:00:32,173
David Palmer is an accessory to murder.

6
00:00:32,298 --> 00:00:37,012
David lied to the chief of police last night
in order to provide an alibi for me.

7
00:00:37,463 --> 00:00:39,854
- Why are you lying to me?
- I screwed up earlier.

8
00:00:39,945 --> 00:00:43,020
The SAT transmission on my system
was forged by own people.

9
00:00:43,148 --> 00:00:45,984
Making a mistake is one thing.
Covering it up is another.

10
00:00:46,111 --> 00:00:48,992
I can't let you stay in place.
I am taking over command of CTU.

11
00:00:49,114 --> 00:00:53,157
- I made a mistake, Jack.
- No, Tony. You made two.

12
00:00:53,639 --> 00:00:58,592
I'm going to let you speak to your husband.
Tell him you're OK and being treated well.

13
00:00:58,684 --> 00:01:01,678
<i>-  Are you all right?
- I'm fine. Don't let them do this...</i>

14
00:01:01,807 --> 00:01:05,200
If Jane is not released when I order it,
your wife dies.

15
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:08,370
That's all you need to know. Are we clear?

16
00:01:08,813 --> 00:01:13,938
From this point on, I am assuming control
of CTU. Tony Almeida has stepped down.

17
00:01:14,019 --> 00:01:18,221
<i> I'm taking Jane Saunders to Division.
Here's the order.</i>

18
00:01:18,343 --> 00:01:23,057
We're leaving right now.
We're going out this way right here.

19
00:01:23,147 --> 00:01:26,062
- Where are all the guards?
- We don't need those guards.

20
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:30,985
Tony locked me in here. Saunders has
Michelle. He's using her to get his daughter.

21
00:01:31,115 --> 00:01:35,796
- This is Almeida. We're out. I've got her.
- I'll give you instructions in 20 minutes.

22
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,359
Exit security, I need a 20 on Tony Almeida.

23
00:01:49,653 --> 00:01:54,527
Chloe, pull up all the surveillance tape
from every exit. Focus on the last 10 minutes.

24
00:01:54,658 --> 00:01:57,778
- Have you linked up with traffic yet?
- I'm working on it.

25
00:01:57,901 --> 00:02:01,101
- I just heard Tony took Jane Saunders.
- That's right.

26
00:02:01,185 --> 00:02:03,223
- Why?
- Saunders has Michelle.

27
00:02:03,347 --> 00:02:05,909
- He wants to trade her.
- Jane is our only leverage.

28
00:02:05,989 --> 00:02:07,344
I know that.

29
00:02:07,471 --> 00:02:10,671
I got him. He left the building
and drove off the premises.

30
00:02:10,794 --> 00:02:15,919
He's in a silver SUV. Prep a tactical team.
Be ready to move as soon as I give the order.

31
00:02:15,999 --> 00:02:19,119
I got him. He's on 5th
about half a mile from here, heading east.

32
00:02:19,242 --> 00:02:22,317
I'll call you from the car.

33
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:32,691
<i> Son of a bitch.</i>

34
00:02:34,457 --> 00:02:37,497
- Are you OK?
- It's just traffic.

35
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:42,380
- You've been acting all weird since we left.
- There's a lot going on right now.

36
00:02:42,465 --> 00:02:46,222
You never explained why you wanted
to transfer me to this Division place.

37
00:02:46,349 --> 00:02:48,626
- I told you...
- I know. It doesn't make sense.

38
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:52,953
I don't have the time
to explain it to you right now.

39
00:02:57,359 --> 00:03:01,072
Almeida got my daughter out of CTU.
Be ready to move the moment I tell you.

40
00:03:01,203 --> 00:03:03,560
When are you calling Almeida
with instructions?

41
00:03:03,685 --> 00:03:06,646
15 minutes. I'll be with Frederick.

42
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:18,449
At least 800 people are dead or dying
in the Chandler Plaza Hotel

43
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:23,215
because Saunders released a weaponized
virus into the ventilation system.

44
00:03:23,305 --> 00:03:26,505
What the media is reporting is a cover story.

45
00:03:26,628 --> 00:03:30,386
They're deflecting the truth
to avoid mass panic.

46
00:03:31,713 --> 00:03:34,514
You'll be infected along with everyone else!

47
00:03:35,116 --> 00:03:38,795
No matter what he's paying you,
it's not worth losing your life!

48
00:03:43,324 --> 00:03:48,119
Jack's in pursuit of Tony. We move out
as soon as we get a location on Saunders.

49
00:03:48,249 --> 00:03:50,082
Good.

50
00:03:50,211 --> 00:03:54,094
- Kim, what are you doing?
- I'm on the team monitoring my father.

51
00:03:54,215 --> 00:03:57,015
- I thought you were setting up a tactical unit.
- I am.

52
00:03:57,138 --> 00:04:00,258
We have to wait
until we get a location on Saunders.

53
00:04:00,341 --> 00:04:04,657
Listen. Before I have to go back out there,
I wanna talk to you.

54
00:04:04,785 --> 00:04:06,743
About what?

55
00:04:07,828 --> 00:04:10,425
About us.

56
00:04:10,551 --> 00:04:13,910
I need to know
whether there's gonna be an us.

57
00:04:18,158 --> 00:04:23,716
Look, I've been thinking about it a lot,
and the baby changes everything.

58
00:04:23,844 --> 00:04:27,522
- It doesn't change the way I feel about you.
- Forget about me for a second.

59
00:04:27,647 --> 00:04:32,328
You have a daughter
and a job that won't let you be with her.

60
00:04:32,452 --> 00:04:35,174
Is that you talking or your father?

61
00:04:35,295 --> 00:04:39,258
My dad would be the first one to admit it -
he wasn't the greatest dad.

62
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:43,501
And it wasn't because he didn't love me.
I know he loved me.

63
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:46,145
It was because of his job.

64
00:04:48,227 --> 00:04:53,990
If I transferred out of field ops,
would you consider staying with me?

65
00:04:57,396 --> 00:05:02,634
I wanna stay with you,
and I would raise a child with you, Chase.

66
00:05:05,364 --> 00:05:07,755
<i>I just won't raise one for you.</i>

67
00:05:20,739 --> 00:05:24,702
- Adam, is he still on 5th Street?
- No, he turned between Jarvis and Hill.

68
00:05:24,823 --> 00:05:26,895
<i>- Widen the search.
- I am.</i>

69
00:05:28,387 --> 00:05:32,224
Got him. He's going south on Vine, two
blocks below Hill. You could save time...

70
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:34,104
I got it.

71
00:05:38,156 --> 00:05:41,117
He's hit traffic.
You might be able to intercept on Grant.

72
00:05:48,326 --> 00:05:53,928
Look, I know you're lying to me.
I know you're not taking me to Division.

73
00:05:55,053 --> 00:05:58,685
- You're fine, Jane.
- At least tell me where we're going.

74
00:05:59,777 --> 00:06:03,490
- Where are you taking me?
- Back to your father.

75
00:06:03,581 --> 00:06:06,576
My father? Why?

76
00:06:07,425 --> 00:06:13,666
He's holding my wife hostage.
He'll kill her if I don't take you back to him.

77
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:16,945
So, basically, you're kidnapping me.

78
00:06:19,076 --> 00:06:20,716
I'm sorry.

79
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:24,994
After everything he's done,
how can you be sure he'll do what he says?

80
00:06:25,122 --> 00:06:28,003
How do you know
he won't kill your wife anyway?

81
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:32,759
I don't have a choice. I wish I did, but I don't.

82
00:06:50,587 --> 00:06:53,228
Tony, put the gun on the dash!

83
00:06:53,349 --> 00:06:57,187
Put the gun on the dash now!

84
00:07:05,001 --> 00:07:07,471
Slowly get out of the car.

85
00:07:13,129 --> 00:07:16,329
Jane, stay where you are.
Everything's gonna be fine.

86
00:07:19,535 --> 00:07:22,097
- Saunders has Michelle.
- I know.

87
00:07:22,778 --> 00:07:25,932
- He wants to make a trade.
- I know. I can't let that happen.

88
00:07:26,061 --> 00:07:28,133
I almost lost her once today.

89
00:07:28,263 --> 00:07:31,258
I understand exactly how you're feeling.
I've been there.

90
00:07:31,387 --> 00:07:35,748
- And you handled it just like me!
- Millions of lives are at stake.

91
00:07:35,911 --> 00:07:40,626
- Rules apply to other people, but not to you?
- Tony, just calm down, OK? Come on.

92
00:07:40,716 --> 00:07:44,428
You help me make this trade,
I'll turn myself in, go to prison, whatever.

93
00:07:44,559 --> 00:07:47,794
I can't do it.
We need Jane to lure her father in.

94
00:07:47,923 --> 00:07:51,202
- Even if Michelle's gotta die?
- Michelle doesn't have to die.

95
00:07:51,326 --> 00:07:54,321
We can string Saunders along.
Start working with me.

96
00:07:54,449 --> 00:07:56,601
- Chase has already got a strike team.
- No!

97
00:07:56,731 --> 00:08:02,130
- Saunders sees CTU, he kills Michelle.
- He's not gonna know we're there.

98
00:08:04,138 --> 00:08:06,780
Where are you meeting him?

99
00:08:06,901 --> 00:08:13,062
Tony, you don't have a choice. You've gotta
work with me on this. Where is the meeting?

100
00:08:13,187 --> 00:08:16,341
Come on. Where are you meeting him?

101
00:08:18,753 --> 00:08:22,636
He wants me to be at a payphone at the
corner of Taylor and Vine in five minutes.

102
00:08:22,717 --> 00:08:26,554
He'll give me further instructions from there.

103
00:08:28,602 --> 00:08:31,278
Thank you. You're doing the right thing.

104
00:08:54,147 --> 00:08:57,905
The quarantined areas are in red.
As far as we know, we have containment.

105
00:08:58,031 --> 00:09:02,506
- We're still not certain?
- We can't be certain for hours, maybe days.

106
00:09:02,636 --> 00:09:05,357
The press is breathing
down Gerry's neck pretty hard.

107
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:08,712
- He thinks we should release a statement.
- I already have.

108
00:09:08,842 --> 00:09:12,679
I've closed down public transportation
and told people to stay in their homes.

109
00:09:12,805 --> 00:09:15,003
We have F-18s patrolling the skies.

110
00:09:15,128 --> 00:09:19,603
But we haven't revealed the exact nature of
this threat, and the press is picking up on it.

111
00:09:19,732 --> 00:09:24,492
We have 10 million people spread out
over a 4,000 square-mile area.

112
00:09:24,577 --> 00:09:27,811
If even a small percentage
decide to leave at the same time,

113
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:32,176
it will ignite a public panic
beyond anything we could control.

114
00:09:32,344 --> 00:09:37,469
The right thing to do is to withhold the truth
until we're sure the virus is contained.

115
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:42,105
I'll tell Gerry to hold off on the press
as long as he can.

116
00:09:47,239 --> 00:09:49,197
<i>Mr President.</i>

117
00:09:51,203 --> 00:09:54,323
<i>- Yes, Jeannie?
- Senator Keeler's here to see you.</i>

118
00:09:56,848 --> 00:09:59,570
<i>- Have him brought in.
- Yes, sir.</i>

119
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:09,980
Thank you.

120
00:10:13,144 --> 00:10:15,980
- Hello, John.
- Mr President.

121
00:10:16,107 --> 00:10:19,466
- Please, take a seat.
- Thank you, I'll stand.

122
00:10:19,591 --> 00:10:24,111
You can imagine my surprise
when I was told that you wanted to see me.

123
00:10:24,235 --> 00:10:26,877
Are you withdrawing from the race?

124
00:10:26,998 --> 00:10:33,842
Mr President, with respect to the death
of Alan Milliken, I know you lied to the police.

125
00:10:33,965 --> 00:10:35,240
Excuse me?

126
00:10:35,366 --> 00:10:39,727
You obstructed the investigation
of a capital crime.

127
00:10:41,132 --> 00:10:46,575
That's a baseless charge. Though I've come
to expect this kind of recklessness from you.

128
00:10:46,657 --> 00:10:50,415
No, sir, it is neither baseless nor reckless.

129
00:10:55,065 --> 00:11:00,941
This is a photograph of the nitroglycerin
medicine that would have saved his life...

130
00:11:01,031 --> 00:11:03,992
if it hadn't been kept from him.

131
00:11:07,037 --> 00:11:11,319
You told the police Sherry was with you
at the time of Milliken's death.

132
00:11:11,441 --> 00:11:16,315
Her fingerprints on this prescription bottle
prove otherwise.

133
00:11:16,446 --> 00:11:23,131
Now, the last thing this country needs is to
have its president dragged through the mud

134
00:11:23,213 --> 00:11:26,173
for complicity in a murder.

135
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:30,090
Why are you showing me this, John?
What do you want?

136
00:11:30,219 --> 00:11:32,531
Your resignation.

137
00:11:34,424 --> 00:11:36,986
Not immediately, of course.

138
00:11:38,107 --> 00:11:41,626
But once this crisis
you're dealing with is over,

139
00:11:41,751 --> 00:11:47,672
you can resign with whatever
face-saving reason you wanna give.

140
00:11:47,797 --> 00:11:49,595
Get out of here.

141
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,075
I'm offering you the chance
to leave office with honor,

142
00:11:54,203 --> 00:11:57,357
to control how your legacy is written.

143
00:12:02,131 --> 00:12:04,693
It's a good deal, David.

144
00:12:05,814 --> 00:12:08,377
You should take it.

145
00:12:35,763 --> 00:12:37,483
I should go to the phone.

146
00:12:37,605 --> 00:12:41,841
As soon as he tells you where he wants
the exchange to take place, reject the location.

147
00:12:41,929 --> 00:12:45,562
We need him to pick a secondary location
so Chase has time to embed his teams.

148
00:12:45,693 --> 00:12:48,369
If I don't go where he wants,
he's gonna kill Michelle.

149
00:12:48,496 --> 00:12:51,332
Not as long as we have his daughter.

150
00:12:51,459 --> 00:12:57,221
- What if he doesn't go for it?
- You've got some leverage here. Use it.

151
00:12:57,344 --> 00:12:59,098
I need to go.

152
00:13:14,962 --> 00:13:18,355
My father kidnapped his wife because of me?

153
00:13:18,485 --> 00:13:21,605
Something like that.

154
00:13:21,688 --> 00:13:24,967
And now you wanna use me
as bait to get to him.

155
00:13:25,091 --> 00:13:30,888
We're gonna do whatever we have to
to stop your father from releasing this virus.

156
00:13:32,659 --> 00:13:35,620
Stay here. We'll be right back.

157
00:13:56,802 --> 00:13:59,763
- Where are we meeting?
- First let me speak with my daughter.

158
00:13:59,885 --> 00:14:03,848
No, you can talk to her
when we make the exchange.

159
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:05,840
All right.

160
00:14:05,971 --> 00:14:10,413
Bring her to an industrial park three miles
north of where you are on Morton Road.

161
00:14:10,536 --> 00:14:13,098
A car will be waiting at loading dock 22.

162
00:14:13,178 --> 00:14:16,891
Choose a new place. That doesn't work.

163
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:21,703
Make it work. You've got 10 minutes to get
to the industrial park or your wife will die.

164
00:14:21,827 --> 00:14:24,104
- If we meet there, we all die.
- Really?

165
00:14:24,229 --> 00:14:26,826
CTU has satellite surveillance of that area.

166
00:14:26,952 --> 00:14:31,666
They're dedicating all their resources
to finding me right now. Pick a new spot.

167
00:14:31,797 --> 00:14:36,272
I am not negotiating terms. I've planned
too long and too hard for this day.

168
00:14:36,401 --> 00:14:40,523
I will do whatever it takes
to make sure nothing interferes,

169
00:14:40,645 --> 00:14:45,006
even... even if it means
sacrificing my daughter.

170
00:14:46,891 --> 00:14:49,283
You need to understand my commitment.

171
00:14:49,414 --> 00:14:53,331
- What the hell you doing?
- He's testing you. He'll phone back.

172
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:56,258
- How do you know?
- He thinks I'm gonna kill his daughter.

173
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:59,261
He exposed himself
to make sure she's still safe.

174
00:14:59,383 --> 00:15:01,661
That's what you'd do,
but you're not Saunders.

175
00:15:01,786 --> 00:15:05,259
No matter how well you think
you know this guy, you're not him.

176
00:15:05,389 --> 00:15:07,461
This isn't a game. She's my wife.

177
00:15:07,591 --> 00:15:11,713
Michelle's got a chance if we control
the ground where the exchange takes place.

178
00:15:11,836 --> 00:15:14,398
But protecting her is not your priority, is it?

179
00:15:14,518 --> 00:15:20,315
If she were to get killed, that would be
an acceptable loss, wouldn't it?

180
00:15:20,444 --> 00:15:24,839
My God, Jack. Didn't you learn anything
from what happened to Teri?

181
00:15:24,928 --> 00:15:27,491
Shut up, Tony. Shut up!

182
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,374
Tony!

183
00:15:38,502 --> 00:15:44,298
Just because you sacrificed your wife for this
job doesn't mean I'm gonna sacrifice mine!

184
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:07,324
I'm here.

185
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:10,650
Make no mistake, this is your first
and your last accommodation.

186
00:16:10,773 --> 00:16:13,370
Just tell me where
you wanna make the exchange.

187
00:16:13,496 --> 00:16:16,571
Downtown, under the 6th Street Bridge.

188
00:16:17,259 --> 00:16:20,539
<i>- Under the 6th Street Bridge.
- Be there in 30 minutes.</i>

189
00:16:20,663 --> 00:16:27,222
But if I see that you've brought anyone else
into this, I will kill your wife.

190
00:16:30,352 --> 00:16:32,915
You did great.

191
00:16:52,494 --> 00:16:56,969
Tony'll make the exchange, but until we know
that Saunders is on site, we stay invisible.

192
00:16:57,058 --> 00:16:59,894
I'll assign positions on the way out. Let's go.

193
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:05,105
- What is it?
- Satellite pictures of 6th Street Bridge.

194
00:17:05,226 --> 00:17:08,984
- I asked for real-time feed.
- We'll have it to you when you're on site.

195
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:13,471
- What about air support?
- We're coordinating with the marines.

196
00:17:13,594 --> 00:17:15,393
Look, Chase...

197
00:17:16,717 --> 00:17:19,075
please be careful.

198
00:17:20,761 --> 00:17:23,324
Don't worry about me. I'll be fine.

199
00:17:28,369 --> 00:17:34,564
Chloe, how much time before you can set up
a real-time satellite feed for 6th Street Bridge?

200
00:17:34,695 --> 00:17:39,056
Do you really think Chase is gonna
quit field ops to start a family?

201
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:43,536
- He won't.
- It's none of your business.

202
00:17:43,664 --> 00:17:47,182
I've known Chase for three years.
You've been dating for three months.

203
00:17:47,307 --> 00:17:50,700
- Your point being?
- He's a great guy, but he's like your father.

204
00:17:50,831 --> 00:17:54,304
They're the same, so if you're expecting him
to leave for the suburbs,

205
00:17:54,434 --> 00:17:57,588
you should revise your expectations.

206
00:17:58,878 --> 00:18:01,441
- When can you uplink a satellite feed?
- 10 minutes.

207
00:18:01,521 --> 00:18:06,076
- Then do it.
- I'm just trying to be a friend, that's all.

208
00:18:13,413 --> 00:18:16,168
<i>- Hello?
- You've gone too far this time, Sherry.</i>

209
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:18,937
I thought I might be hearing from you, David.

210
00:18:19,058 --> 00:18:22,737
You sent Keeler over here to blackmail me
into giving up my presidency!

211
00:18:22,862 --> 00:18:25,857
Whoa, whoa, slow down.
You mean Keeler paid you a visit?

212
00:18:25,985 --> 00:18:28,786
You know damn well he did,
and you know why.

213
00:18:28,908 --> 00:18:31,983
Only you could have given him
that prescription bottle.

214
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,343
OK, supposing that was true. What then?

215
00:18:34,473 --> 00:18:37,593
- You could go to jail for murder.
- You could go to jail, too.

216
00:18:37,716 --> 00:18:40,517
You lied to the police.
You told them that I was with you.

217
00:18:40,639 --> 00:18:45,240
Withholding evidence, obstruction of justice.
Those are serious crimes.

218
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:49,924
I knew you wanted to go down in
the history books, but I'm not certain like this.

219
00:18:50,048 --> 00:18:53,202
- What did Keeler offer you?
- What you should have offered me.

220
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:55,289
Respect, and a seat at the table.

221
00:18:55,414 --> 00:18:57,805
But you called me up when you needed me,

222
00:18:57,976 --> 00:19:02,850
<i>and then after I did your little dirty work,
you threw me out like an old pair of shoes.</i>

223
00:19:02,941 --> 00:19:07,257
You know me, Sherry. Better than anyone.

224
00:19:07,866 --> 00:19:10,428
<i>You know I won't be bullied.</i>

225
00:19:10,508 --> 00:19:14,471
So before this goes too far,
you better ask yourself a question.

226
00:19:14,592 --> 00:19:20,070
- Are you willing to go to jail?
- I've asked myself that a million times.

227
00:19:20,198 --> 00:19:23,477
And the answer is yes,
I am willing to go to jail.

228
00:19:23,561 --> 00:19:26,124
<i>The question is, are you?</i>

229
00:19:29,767 --> 00:19:31,725
I didn't think so.

230
00:19:42,339 --> 00:19:44,297
I want the strike team in two groups.

231
00:19:44,421 --> 00:19:48,704
Group A can take cover here, group B here.
I want them ready to go when we get there.

232
00:19:48,826 --> 00:19:52,060
If Saunders sees anyone,
he's not gonna make the approach.

233
00:19:52,189 --> 00:19:55,184
- What's the response time for air support?
- 30 seconds.

234
00:19:55,312 --> 00:19:58,991
- I'll relay the coordinates.
- See you at the bridge.

235
00:20:00,677 --> 00:20:05,517
I know my father released the virus
in the hotel, that people died,

236
00:20:07,124 --> 00:20:10,437
but do you really think
he'll do what he's saying?

237
00:20:11,528 --> 00:20:14,682
Release it all over the country?

238
00:20:16,733 --> 00:20:19,124
If we don't stop him, yes.

239
00:20:19,255 --> 00:20:21,567
Why?

240
00:20:21,698 --> 00:20:25,137
There has to be a reason he's doing all of this.

241
00:20:25,261 --> 00:20:29,942
When I worked with him, he was dedicated
to saving the lives of innocent people.

242
00:20:30,066 --> 00:20:32,707
Something's happened to him,
I don't know what,

243
00:20:32,829 --> 00:20:35,550
but now he believes
our government's betrayed him.

244
00:20:35,671 --> 00:20:38,234
Is he right?

245
00:20:41,797 --> 00:20:44,439
There's no easy answer to that.

246
00:20:45,641 --> 00:20:50,640
The work your father did often demanded
that he make seemingly impossible sacrifices.

247
00:20:50,726 --> 00:20:57,889
Whatever happened to your father in Bosnia
was a sacrifice he wasn't willing to make.

248
00:20:58,013 --> 00:20:59,971
I'm sorry.

249
00:21:03,899 --> 00:21:07,099
<i>-  No!
- Shut up! No one can hear you.</i>

250
00:21:07,222 --> 00:21:10,023
<i>Shut up now!</i>

251
00:21:10,145 --> 00:21:12,103
No!

252
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:19,227
- No! Oh, God!
- I said stop. Stop screaming.

253
00:21:21,076 --> 00:21:24,116
Look at me. I've been infected.

254
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:26,792
Help me. Help me.

255
00:21:27,522 --> 00:21:29,115
Oh, God!

256
00:21:32,407 --> 00:21:34,365
No.

257
00:21:34,489 --> 00:21:36,607
- We got a problem here.
- What's going on?

258
00:21:36,731 --> 00:21:40,010
- She has it. She has the virus.
- What are you talking about?

259
00:21:40,134 --> 00:21:43,049
She's bleeding.
She must have caught it at the hotel.

260
00:21:43,177 --> 00:21:46,331
<i>They wouldn't release her
without testing her. It's a trick.</i>

261
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:48,738
She did it to herself.

262
00:21:50,504 --> 00:21:54,103
<i>Kevin, are you there? Kevin!</i>

263
00:22:23,857 --> 00:22:28,139
Take the east corridor. Stop her from getting
above ground, but do not shoot to kill.

264
00:23:51,182 --> 00:23:53,140
<i>O'Brian.</i>

265
00:23:53,264 --> 00:23:56,623
<i>-  Chloe, it's me. It's Michelle.
- Hello?</i>

266
00:23:57,148 --> 00:23:58,628
Can you hear me?

267
00:23:58,749 --> 00:24:01,664
Whoever this is,
I have a really bad connection.

268
00:24:01,752 --> 00:24:03,631
Chloe!

269
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:33,101
So what did Keeler want?

270
00:24:33,223 --> 00:24:35,786
My job.

271
00:24:36,466 --> 00:24:39,586
He has proof that Sherry
was at Alan Milliken's tonight.

272
00:24:39,709 --> 00:24:42,510
What? What proof?

273
00:24:44,874 --> 00:24:49,509
Alan Milliken's prescription bottle turned up
with Sherry's fingerprints on it.

274
00:24:52,121 --> 00:24:56,084
- How did he get ahold of this?
- How do you think?

275
00:24:56,205 --> 00:24:58,163
Sherry?

276
00:25:00,169 --> 00:25:03,722
I talked to her a few minutes ago.
She didn't even bother to deny it.

277
00:25:03,853 --> 00:25:07,053
She's gotta be bluffing.
If this gets out, she goes to jail.

278
00:25:07,176 --> 00:25:09,453
So will I.

279
00:25:09,578 --> 00:25:12,699
She figures I have more to lose than she does.

280
00:25:14,103 --> 00:25:17,815
- And she's right.
- What does Keeler want you to do?

281
00:25:17,947 --> 00:25:22,422
Withdraw from the race...
for whatever reason I choose.

282
00:25:22,511 --> 00:25:24,708
The party gets thrown into chaos.

283
00:25:24,833 --> 00:25:28,989
Whoever takes my place
won't have a prayer in the election.

284
00:25:30,359 --> 00:25:33,114
And Keeler becomes president.

285
00:25:34,042 --> 00:25:36,000
Oh, my God.

286
00:25:38,367 --> 00:25:41,042
This is all my fault.

287
00:25:41,169 --> 00:25:43,127
Hey, look.

288
00:25:44,533 --> 00:25:47,095
We both made mistakes.

289
00:25:50,378 --> 00:25:53,339
I'm the one who called Sherry.

290
00:26:01,349 --> 00:26:04,662
- There may be a way out of this.
- How?

291
00:26:05,953 --> 00:26:08,993
Without this, Sherry's got nothing, right?

292
00:26:09,117 --> 00:26:13,797
- What are you suggesting?
- We take away the only leverage she has.

293
00:26:13,921 --> 00:26:16,802
You mean steal evidence?

294
00:26:16,924 --> 00:26:20,921
- My God, Wayne.
- Before you say no, you just think about this.

295
00:26:21,048 --> 00:26:23,439
I can call Foxton
and he can make this disappear.

296
00:26:23,571 --> 00:26:25,962
All you have to do is give me the OK.

297
00:27:06,733 --> 00:27:08,691
You stay with her.

298
00:27:10,256 --> 00:27:12,932
- Is your team in place?
- Two minutes, they'll be ready.

299
00:27:13,059 --> 00:27:15,734
- They'll be out of sight?
- They'll be invisible.

300
00:27:15,862 --> 00:27:19,016
- I'm gonna back Tony up here.
- We should get into position.

301
00:27:19,145 --> 00:27:21,981
- Priority call from Kim.
- This is Jack.

302
00:27:22,068 --> 00:27:24,630
- I got Michelle on the line.
- Is she with Saunders?

303
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:26,822
No, she said she got away from him.

304
00:27:26,952 --> 00:27:30,187
- Patch her through.
- Hold on.

305
00:27:31,557 --> 00:27:35,189
<i>- Michelle, go ahead.
- I got away from Saunders, but he's after me.</i>

306
00:27:35,321 --> 00:27:37,632
Michelle, it's me. Where are you?

307
00:27:38,524 --> 00:27:41,837
Wilshire. A block east of Olive.

308
00:27:41,967 --> 00:27:43,925
- Send your strike team in now.
- Don't.

309
00:27:44,049 --> 00:27:46,725
- What are you talking about?
- Michelle, listen.

310
00:27:46,852 --> 00:27:49,688
- Let Saunders catch you again.
- Are you crazy?

311
00:27:49,815 --> 00:27:53,015
We have to let the exchange go down.
It's the only way to catch him.

312
00:27:53,138 --> 00:27:56,656
- You want me to give myself up?
- Yes. The exchange site is secure.

313
00:27:56,782 --> 00:28:00,255
- I'll send our people in when he's there.
- Redirect your people now!

314
00:28:00,385 --> 00:28:03,824
- Chase, don't!
- Jack, stay out of this!

315
00:28:03,908 --> 00:28:08,589
You are not in command here.
Get him out of here now! Now!

316
00:28:09,314 --> 00:28:14,187
That's my wife, Jack, you son of a bitch!
My wife! Jack!

317
00:28:14,479 --> 00:28:18,715
We need this exchange to go through.
Everything depends on it. Understand?

318
00:28:20,004 --> 00:28:23,717
<i>If he doesn't have you to trade,
he's not gonna go through with this meeting.</i>

319
00:28:23,848 --> 00:28:28,448
<i>We're not gonna get another chance at this.
Do you understand, Michelle?</i>

320
00:28:28,573 --> 00:28:30,007
Yes.

321
00:28:30,494 --> 00:28:34,777
We're gonna do everything to make sure you
come out of this OK, but we gotta move now.

322
00:28:34,899 --> 00:28:37,734
Let's get our teams into position.

323
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:42,835
I thought your brother was a politician
who would never lower himself to my level.

324
00:29:42,925 --> 00:29:46,364
I need to recover something
that could cause him a lot of trouble.

325
00:29:46,489 --> 00:29:50,087
- What is it?
- A bottle of medicine from a crime scene.

326
00:29:50,212 --> 00:29:54,255
- Has it been admitted into evidence?
- No.

327
00:29:54,376 --> 00:29:58,692
It's in the possession of Sherry Palmer,
the president's ex-wife.

328
00:29:58,821 --> 00:30:03,535
I have a pretty good idea where she is and
can partially reconstruct where she's been.

329
00:30:03,625 --> 00:30:08,385
- What time frame are we looking at?
- Hours, Foxton, not days.

330
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:12,189
Has this... operation been authorized
by the president?

331
00:30:14,556 --> 00:30:17,278
What difference does that make?
You'll get your money.

332
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:21,396
I'm not worried about that.
I just need to know who I'm working for.

333
00:30:21,523 --> 00:30:24,723
My brother knows what you're doing.

334
00:30:24,846 --> 00:30:29,207
Not that I don't trust you, but...
I'd like to hear it from him.

335
00:30:31,172 --> 00:30:33,130
Fine.

336
00:30:36,257 --> 00:30:39,138
That's proof enough.

337
00:30:45,306 --> 00:30:47,264
Let's go.

338
00:30:54,675 --> 00:30:57,431
Do Chase's men have Saunders yet?

339
00:30:58,759 --> 00:31:00,991
No one's coming yet.

340
00:31:15,175 --> 00:31:20,300
Look, Jack, promise me you won't make
a move on Saunders until Michelle is safe.

341
00:31:21,141 --> 00:31:26,664
We move as soon as we've got a visual
on Saunders. That's how it's gotta go.

342
00:31:26,746 --> 00:31:31,779
I know. I'm... I'm just asking you
just to do what you can.

343
00:31:32,512 --> 00:31:34,982
You know I will.

344
00:31:37,477 --> 00:31:40,118
We've got three cars headed in from the west.

345
00:31:42,161 --> 00:31:45,601
- Tony, they're coming. Are you ready?
- Yeah.

346
00:32:03,862 --> 00:32:07,097
Windows are tinted. I can't see inside.

347
00:32:26,364 --> 00:32:29,599
<i>- Yeah.
-  Give her the phone.</i>

348
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:35,362
<i>My preference is to turn you over
to your husband unharmed.</i>

349
00:32:35,493 --> 00:32:38,056
But I will kill you if anything goes wrong.

350
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:15,364
Yeah.

351
00:33:15,492 --> 00:33:19,728
<i> When I see my daughter,
you get your wife.</i>

352
00:33:19,857 --> 00:33:21,211
Right.

353
00:33:24,261 --> 00:33:27,222
Jane, I need you to get out of the car.

354
00:33:34,191 --> 00:33:37,151
Everything's gonna be OK.

355
00:33:42,759 --> 00:33:47,359
- I want you to walk over to your father's men.
- Where's my father?

356
00:33:47,484 --> 00:33:49,476
We don't know.

357
00:33:49,606 --> 00:33:54,559
Listen, we have to do this, Jane. I'm sorry.

358
00:33:59,415 --> 00:34:04,255
Look, Jane, you gotta trust me on this.
Please, go. Come on.

359
00:34:32,688 --> 00:34:37,813
- Jack, send your men in now.
- We don't have a visual on Saunders.

360
00:35:01,115 --> 00:35:02,755
- I can't.
- Come here!

361
00:35:02,877 --> 00:35:06,111
- Turn around!
- Jane, it's OK! Come here!

362
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:10,283
Teams A and B move.
We've got a visual on Saunders. Move now!

363
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:37,906
Stephen!

364
00:35:53,647 --> 00:35:55,604
Stephen!

365
00:36:04,577 --> 00:36:07,936
I'm pinned down! Saunders has a helicopter.
Call in air support now!

366
00:36:08,061 --> 00:36:11,579
<i>- I repeat, call in air support!
- I need air support!</i>

367
00:36:11,704 --> 00:36:15,587
I've got two US marine F-18s just off
the marina, call sign Guardian Angel.

368
00:36:15,708 --> 00:36:19,147
Copy that! Guardian Angel,
this is Watchtower!

369
00:36:19,272 --> 00:36:21,834
We got a hostile at vector Bravo Tango!

370
00:36:34,126 --> 00:36:38,169
<i> Jack, marines are coming in.
Take cover.</i>

371
00:36:53,985 --> 00:36:55,500
Let's go! Let's go!

372
00:37:05,837 --> 00:37:07,955
Chopper's been taken out!

373
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:20,924
- You OK?
- Yeah.

374
00:37:56,446 --> 00:37:58,439
<i> Don't move!</i>

375
00:37:58,568 --> 00:38:01,882
11 vials of the virus are unaccounted for.
Where are they?

376
00:38:02,012 --> 00:38:06,294
- It's not gonna be that simple, Jack.
- Stephen, it's over.

377
00:38:06,376 --> 00:38:09,451
No, it's not, Jack. It's just beginning.

378
00:38:12,622 --> 00:38:14,740
Where are the vials?

379
00:38:17,227 --> 00:38:22,625
You can waste time trying to break me
and kill millions of people.

380
00:38:22,752 --> 00:38:24,904
Or you can give me what I want.

381
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,552
This is Jack Bauer. Saunders is in custody.
