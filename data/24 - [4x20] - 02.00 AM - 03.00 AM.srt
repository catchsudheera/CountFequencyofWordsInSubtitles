1
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,835
- I want Bauer arrested.
- Bauer is heading the field operation.

2
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,878
Bauer is not the only man who can do the job!
Put someone else in charge!

3
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,238
<i> Jack, we got a problem. </i>
<i>Secret Service is on their way to arrest you. </i>

4
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,993
We can't interrupt this mission.
You gotta stall 'em.

5
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,709
Nothing I can do.
Get Marwan before Secret Service gets there.

6
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,759
People of America,
you wake up today to a different world.

7
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,515
I have a visual on Marwan.
He is in the building.

8
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,310
- They know we're here. Move on the building.
- Our cover's blown. Everyone, go, go, go, go!

9
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,709
Bomb!

10
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:54,592
President Logan realised this was a mistake.
You're free to go.

11
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,636
We had Marwan.

12
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,153
Dammit, we had him!

13
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,349
This man, Marwan, has a nuclear warhead
and I allowed him to escape.

14
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,998
- Mr President...
- Stop.

15
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,674
I don't even know
if I deserve to be called that.

16
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,957
There's someone who can
advise you better than I can.

17
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,550
I'm not sure what you're asking me to do.

18
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,316
President Logan is requesting you run
the effort to recover the stolen weapon

19
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,472
and be in place to make
whatever decisions need to be made.

20
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,236
- Is it compatible?
- I'll need to reconfigure the trigger.

21
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,993
- Has the warhead been reconfigured?
- <i> Yes. </i>

22
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:30,755
- We may have a potential security breach.
- Who?

23
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,594
The technician, Sabir.
His girlfriend's getting suspicious.

24
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,033
I think Sabir may have
become involved with radical groups.

25
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,758
- You mean terrorists?
- Yes.

26
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,593
The woman who was suspicious
about her boyfriend panned out.

27
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,958
She sent us a schematic of a microchip. It's
used exclusively in legacy nuclear warheads.

28
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,598
Take a team with you. Let's go.

29
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,591
What was that?

30
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,718
He's gonna ram us!

31
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,752
- Good to have you back, Mr President.
- Than you, Aaron.

32
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:30,230
- This way, sir.
- President Logan's not in the West Wing?

33
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:35,394
No, sir. Since the strike on Air Force One,
he's been in the bunker.

34
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:42,356
- How's your son?
- Very well, sir. Thank you for asking.

35
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:46,513
- Still in the service?
- Yes. In fact, he just re-upped.

36
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,909
- Good for him.
- I'm mighty proud.

37
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,149
Mr President. Thank you for coming.

38
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:02,994
- Is there an update on President Keeler?
- No, he's still comatose.

39
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,913
- The long-term prognosis is still unclear?
- Yes.

40
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,958
- How's President Logan?
- Looking forward to seeing you.

41
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,031
Thank you, Eric.

42
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,872
President Logan.

43
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,316
David. I appreciate your coming so quickly.

44
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,358
Tell me how I can help you.

45
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,958
David, I wasn't prepared to have
all of this thrust upon me so suddenly.

46
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,875
What I'm trying to say is, I made mistakes.
This crisis could have ended an hour ago

47
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:38,875
if I hadn't interfered with the CTU operation
that would have captured Habib Marwan.

48
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,952
Punishing yourself
is something you can't afford now.

49
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:46,079
What I can't afford and what this country
can't afford is another mistake.

50
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,038
Every decision I make
affects millions of Americans.

51
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,953
- I understand the pressure you're under.
- I know you do.

52
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:58,149
In office, you dealt with this kind of situation
more than once. That's why I want you here.

53
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,357
I still don't understand
what it is I can do to help you.

54
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,431
Sit.

55
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:09,030
The warhead that was stolen is an S-series.

56
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,432
That's one of the most powerful
nuclear weapons in the arsenal.

57
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:19,436
Wherever it's detonated,
it will wreak unthinkable devastation.

58
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,598
Help me find it. I'll give you
full authority to act as my proxy

59
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,672
whenever you think it's necessary.

60
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,673
Charles, how do you want this to work?

61
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:43,440
I'll call Bill Buchanan at CTU, and I'll let him
know that he'll be dealing directly with you.

62
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,676
All right.

63
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:53,515
Thank you, David.
Mike will fill you in.

64
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,876
We will get through this, Mr President.

65
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,475
Um, I'll be, uh, in conference room B,

66
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,028
working on the
morning statement for the press.

67
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,157
I'll keep you apprised
of any developments, sir.

68
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,913
Thank you, Mike.

69
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:24,871
Mr President. I know you believe
my actions during your term in office

70
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,033
amounted to a personal and political betrayal.

71
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,111
That's not something I believe.

72
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,475
It's a fact. Get to your point.

73
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:39,556
If my presence here makes it more difficult
for you, say the word and I'll leave.

74
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,433
Mike, you're wired into this administration.

75
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,638
And I have no doubt that you have
this country's best interests at heart.

76
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:56,316
So for now, let's let bygones be bygones
and get to work.

77
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,950
Thank you, Mr President. I appreciate that.

78
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,156
I reviewed the briefing on the way here.

79
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:09,314
Have army reserves supplement the search
teams looking for the warhead in Iowa.

80
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,949
And have DOE and DOD
coordinating on crisis response

81
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,871
- in case it's detonated.
- Yes, sir.

82
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,272
CTU is heading up the search for this man
who stole the warhead, Habib Marwan?

83
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,478
Yes, they recovered a damaged video tape
from Marwan's last known location.

84
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,438
They're in the process of restoring it.

85
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:30,195
But Marwan is not
CTU's only lead on the warhead now.

86
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:33,477
- What else do they have?
- A CTU analyst named Chloe O'Brian

87
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,950
secured a hard drive belonging
to one of Marwan's associates.

88
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:41,397
This hard drive may contain information
that could lead us to the warhead.

89
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,469
I told you, I'm not hurt. I did the shooting.
Now please leave me alone so I can do this.

90
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,357
The hard drive is unlocked.

91
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,955
It belonged to someone who had
no experience of nuclear weapons.

92
00:06:56,040 --> 00:07:00,431
- He got that information from someone.
- The emails I'm decrypting look like that.

93
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,476
Schematics, designs of triggers,

94
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,357
- all from the same person.
- Who?

95
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,318
The address is shielded
under a false domain name.

96
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,595
- What is it?
- MEM4FT.

97
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,753
- Forward the emails to us. Edgar?
- I'll run a trace to find a point of origin.

98
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:18,231
These emails came from a domestic server.
Whoever sent this is in this country.

99
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:21,073
OK, Chloe, thank you. Hold on.

100
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,230
Hey. How are you holding up?

101
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,198
I'm not used to the idea that I just
killed someone, but I'm doing my job.

102
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,678
Fair enough.
Get back as soon as you can, OK?

103
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,159
<i>OK.</i>

104
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36,073
I got a hit. The man who sent the emails.
Name is Lee Jong.

105
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,469
- Is he in our database?
- Chinese national.

106
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,472
A researcher at China's
nuclear weapons programme.

107
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:45,109
He was accused of falsifying
research data and fired in 2001.

108
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,873
Is China providing Marwan
with support for this?

109
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,793
They wouldn't use someone
that could be traced to them.

110
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,440
He's selling his services as a freelancer.

111
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,559
If he's helping Marwan reconfigure
the warhead, he'll know how to find him.

112
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:00,791
See if Lee entered the country last week.

113
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,950
Excuse me. This is Bauer.

114
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,511
Jack? Dr Besson. You wanted me
to give you an update on Paul Raines.

115
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:10,229
He's still in recovery, but you can
see him now. Just a few minutes.

116
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,993
Thank you.
Get back to me if you find anything.

117
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,231
- Where can I find you?
- I'll be in Medical.

118
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,838
Hey.

119
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,832
Dr Besson wants to move you
to Amherst General,

120
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,388
but the FAA still has a ban on air travel.

121
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,710
I am trying to get you an exemption.

122
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,952
Well, if anyone can get
an exemption, you can.

123
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,030
Listen.

124
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:48,148
I've thought a lot about this,
and I want to go with you to Massachusetts.

125
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,796
- With me?
- Yeah.

126
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:55,635
You need to get better,
and you shouldn't have to do that alone.

127
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,917
I can take care of myself.
I don't need your charity.

128
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,595
It's not about charity,
Paul, it's what I want to do.

129
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,796
What about Jack?

130
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,269
You said you were in love with him.

131
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,112
I know.

132
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,594
Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.

133
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:21,038
- I'll come back later.
No, it's all right. Come in.

134
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,554
I thought you'd be at the DOD briefing.

135
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,154
- Yeah, it ended early.
- Oh.

136
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,111
I just wanted to see how you were doing.

137
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,671
I've been trying to get down here
since you got out of surgery.

138
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,353
- Listen, Paul...
- You don't have to say anything.

139
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,194
Yeah, I do. You saved my life.

140
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:46,590
I was in the wrong place
at the wrong time. That's all.

141
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:50,309
- You pushed me out of the way.
- Honestly, I wasn't even thinking.

142
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,630
It just happened.

143
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,355
Paul. You all right?

144
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,589
I'll check back on you later.

145
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:12,470
Does he know that
you want to come with me?

146
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,911
Not yet.

147
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:20,437
- What is it?
- We found Lee Jong. Chinese consulate.

148
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:23,114
He must have known we were coming.
He took refuge.

149
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,193
He got there an hour ago. Consulate's
sovereign territory, we can't get him.

150
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:30,113
But we're gonna try. David Palmer for you.

151
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,679
David Palmer?

152
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,036
Frankly, Logan's been
overwhelmed by what's happening.

153
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,749
- He enlisted Palmer to help us directly.
- Good.

154
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,149
- Bauer.
- <i> Hold for the president. </i>

155
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,991
- Sir.
- Thank you, Mike.

156
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:48,835
- It's nice to talk to you again, Jack.
- It's nice to talk to you too.

157
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,956
I assume Bill told you about Lee Jong?

158
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,109
Yes, sir.

159
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,317
I'm about to call the Chinese consul
and explain the situation.

160
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:59,837
I'd like it if you took Lee into custody
and brought him to CTU for interrogation.

161
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,878
- You think the consul will cooperate?
- He's reasonable.

162
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,315
And if the protocol approach doesn't work?

163
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,834
I'll leave it to you to make the preparations.

164
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,674
Whatever it takes.
We need this man Lee in custody.

165
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:16,356
- I understand, Mr President.
- <i>Thank you, Jack. </i>

166
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,908
- You have a Chinese interpreter?
- Melissa Raab.

167
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,834
I need her, Curtis and one of his agents
ready to move on the consulate.

168
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,956
Edgar Stiles.

169
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,396
- <i> We got a partial. </i>
- I'm opening a window. Send it through.

170
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,469
Ms Dessler.

171
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:33,712
Division called. That video tape,
they were able to reconstruct part of it.

172
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,394
They're sending it
to my workstation as we speak.

173
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,471
Bill.

174
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,596
<i>People of America,</i>
<i>you wake up today to a different world. </i>

175
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:49,310
<i>One of your own nuclear weapons</i>
<i>has been used against you. </i>

176
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:53,359
<i>It'll be days and weeks before you can</i>
<i>measure the damage we have caused,</i>

177
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,113
<i>but as you count your dead... </i>

178
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,270
"Wake up today to a different world. "

179
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:02,069
Do we take that literally?
He'll set off the warhead before dawn?

180
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:06,392
We have to look at the worst case scenario.
What time is sunrise on the east coast?

181
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,677
7:02. Less than two hours from now.

182
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:16,919
<i>Unless you renounce your policies of</i>
<i>imperialism and interventionist activities,</i>

183
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,677
<i>this attack will be followed by another,</i>
<i>and another after that. </i>

184
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,471
The Chinese consul in Los Angeles.
A man named Koo Yin.

185
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,069
Mr Koo. This is David Palmer.

186
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,151
It's an honour to speak with you.

187
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,629
<i>I'm calling on behalf of President Logan. </i>

188
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,748
The situation today has forced him to direct
his attention to other equally urgent matters.

189
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,114
I understand.

190
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,637
And my government extends its sympathy
for these terrible attacks on your country.

191
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,915
We stand ready to help in any way we can.

192
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,197
Thank you. The fact is, you can help us.

193
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:09,193
There's a man in your consulate
by the name of Lee Jong.

194
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,076
Yes.

195
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,037
He arrived here earlier tonight.

196
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:16,033
We have evidence connecting him
to the terrorists behind today's attacks.

197
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:19,954
We need to take Mr Lee into custody
immediately for questioning.

198
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,873
Mr Lee expected suspicion to fall on him.

199
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,633
He says he has no connection to terrorists.

200
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:29,713
We believe he's helping terrorists
detonate a nuclear device on our soil.

201
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,678
Many lives are at stake, Mr Koo.

202
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:38,073
President Palmer, I would very much like
to help, but Mr Lee is a Chinese citizen,

203
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,390
and the consulate is Chinese territory.

204
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,677
I can't hand him over to you
without going through channels.

205
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:48,197
Then I urge you to contact the premier
immediately and explain the situation.

206
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,714
Tell him speed is of the essence.

207
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,031
Tell him cooperation will be regarded

208
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:57,476
as an extraordinary act of friendship
on the part of his nation.

209
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:00,757
And our nation will respond in kind.

210
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:04,674
Mr President, I'll do my best.
I'll get back to you as soon as I can.

211
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,433
Thank you, Mr Koo.

212
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:13,034
Consul's gonna try
to make something happen.

213
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,156
How long will it take?

214
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,595
I don't know.

215
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,752
Anything new?

216
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:26,913
White House authorised adding Iowa army
reserve units to the ground search.

217
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,959
- Have they widened the perimeter?
- 60-mile radius around the area.

218
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,191
But Marwan's people
might have sneaked it outside that.

219
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:39,115
We closed all major roads and air traffic,
but there is a chance they got it through.

220
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,795
Homeland Security's faxing over
casualty projections based on that.

221
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:48,070
- That's probably them right now.
- Yeah. I'll get it.

222
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,918
- CTU.
- <i> I'm calling for Tony. Who's this?</i>

223
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,514
Michelle Dessler, a colleague. Who's calling?

224
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,798
The woman he happens to be living with.
Is he there?

225
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,677
Yeah. Hold on.

226
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,591
- It's for you.
- Who is it?

227
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,194
The woman you're living with.

228
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,068
Jen.

229
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,152
I've been calling everyone,
going crazy looking for you.

230
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,708
Then I thought maybe
Jack took you back there.

231
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,189
Do you have any idea how worried I've been?

232
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:23,238
I'm sorry, I should have called,
but I've been busy.

233
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:26,198
Oh, really busy with Michelle Dessler?

234
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,589
- I'm working, Jen.
- For CTU?

235
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,156
On a provisional basis, yeah.

236
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,913
I thought you hated that place.

237
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,309
Things have changed a little.

238
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,436
Yeah. I guess they have.

239
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,512
We can talk about this later.
Right now I gotta go.

240
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:46,151
- Tony, what's your ex-wife doing there?
- Jen, I'm sorry, but I gotta go.

241
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,315
Michelle, um... I'm sorry
you had to find out like that.

242
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,436
It's really none of my business.

243
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:59,751
Yeah, it is. I should have told you
I was living with somebody.

244
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:04,868
- I don't want to talk about this right now.
- Yeah, well, I do. Listen to me.

245
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:11,559
When you left, everything fell apart.
Jen happened to be there for me.

246
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:14,234
You don't have to excuse your relationship.

247
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,356
I'm not making excuses.

248
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,637
I'm just telling you how it is.

249
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,790
Do you love her?

250
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,230
No.

251
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:37,879
Ms Dessler, new protocols from DOD came in.
Should I send them to your screen?

252
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,951
Send them to station 16.

253
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,511
Thank you, Edgar.

254
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,399
- You OK?
- I'm fine.

255
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,151
Is there anything I can do?

256
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:10,189
I said I'm fine. I'm trying not to think about
what happened. I'm gonna process it later.

257
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,635
Sure, fine.

258
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,349
Edgar, I appreciate your concern, I really do.

259
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:23,198
It's just that when I shot that guy I thought I'd
go all foetal, but I didn't feel anything at all.

260
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,033
I hope I'm not some kind of a psychopath.

261
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:28,350
- He was trying to kill you.
- But still...

262
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:33,309
Maybe it's a delayed reaction kind of thing.
Maybe you'll freak out about it in a few days.

263
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,913
I hope so.

264
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,229
- Anything you come up with...
- Sir.

265
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,799
Sir. Bill Buchanan.

266
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,996
- Thank you.
- All right.

267
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,275
- Yes, Bill.
- <i>Mr President. </i>

268
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,749
We've seen a tape recorded by Habib Marwan.

269
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:50,515
On it he says we'll be
"waking up to a different world".

270
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:56,994
It may indicate that the warhead will be
detonated before dawn on the east coast.

271
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,071
Thank you, Bill.

272
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:05,351
CTU thinks that the warhead
may be detonated before dawn.

273
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,431
Get me Mr Koo.

274
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:15,396
- This is Koo Yin.
- <i> Please hold for President Palmer. </i>

275
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,471
We have the consul, sir.

276
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:22,630
- Mr Koo.
- I didn't expect to hear from you so soon.

277
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,109
Is the premier aware of the situation?

278
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,113
- Yes, he's considering it very carefully.
- There's no time for that.

279
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,671
<i>I've learned the terrorists may detonate</i>
<i>a nuclear device within the next two hours. </i>

280
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,274
I understand the urgency of the situation.

281
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:40,512
Without making any promises, I have
every expectation of a favourable answer.

282
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:44,275
- When?
- I'll speak with him in two to three hours.

283
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:51,152
- I told you, that's not soon enough.
- I'm sorry, Mr President, it's the best I can do.

284
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,039
Thank you for your efforts.
Please keep me informed.

285
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,429
Of course, Mr President.

286
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:06,279
He thinks Mr Lee will be handed over to us,
but not before two or three hours.

287
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:09,830
From their point of view,
that's very fast for something like this.

288
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:13,117
From ours, not nearly fast enough.

289
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,315
What do we do?

290
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,555
- Bauer.
- Jack, are you at the consulate yet?

291
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:37,076
Yes, sir. We're across the street.
Have they agreed to release Lee?

292
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,718
Not quickly enough.

293
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:42,554
And I just learned that the nuclear device
may be set off at any moment.

294
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,599
Now, Jack. Is there any doubt in your mind
that Lee is working with Marwan?

295
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:49,478
No, sir. The emails he sent
left no room for doubt.

296
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:52,313
Then we have to get Lee now
and find out what he knows.

297
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,116
Yes, sir.

298
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:58,797
No one connected with the government can
admit to knowing anything about this. Ever.

299
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,555
<i>If you're caught, you'll be tried</i>
<i>in a Chinese court under Chinese law. </i>

300
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,437
I understand.

301
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:08,274
Now, Jack, if it was anyone else,
I'd ask if you were sure about this.

302
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:11,477
<i>With you I already know the answer. </i>

303
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,354
God bless you. Good luck.

304
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,431
Thank you, Mr President.

305
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,118
We're on. We're going in to get him.

306
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,191
All right.

307
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,236
- Almeida.
- <i>Tony, this is Jack. </i>

308
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,392
I'm at the consulate.
I need infrared satellite coverage.

309
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,914
I'm on it. What's going on, Jack?

310
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,312
The consul's not gonna release Lee in time.
We have to go in and get him.

311
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,358
- Who knows?
- We've authorisation from the White House.

312
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,592
Tony, this is a covert operation.
You're the only person in CTU who can know.

313
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:49,878
Spoof the satellite logs and make sure
the mainframes aren't monitoring you.

314
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,793
Tony, there can't be any record.
You understand?

315
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,871
- <i>Yeah. </i>
- OK, thanks.

316
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,674
Let's suit up.

317
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:17,878
- Tony, it's Jack. I'm on comm.
- I'm uploading a picture of Lee to you now.

318
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:22,192
Also, I just got ahold
of the building schematic.

319
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:26,034
- You overlay the infrared?
- <i> Coming now. </i>

320
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:29,157
The bulk of them are in
the first floor residential area.

321
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:32,949
- <i>Most of 'em not moving. Probably asleep. </i>
- Try the second floor offices.

322
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:36,476
All right. Grabbing data on the second floor.

323
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:41,871
- All right, we got people moving.
- That third room is probably where Lee is.

324
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:46,033
- <i>I think you're right. </i>
- I'll get back to you as soon as I'm moving.

325
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:49,590
- How do you want to deploy?
- I want Agent Raab to stay in the van.

326
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,671
You cover the perimeter. I go in alone.

327
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,877
- Jack.
- My orders are to make this deniable.

328
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,794
If I get caught, I have to be able
to say I was acting alone.

329
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,997
- All right. What do you want us to do?
- Cover the perimeter.

330
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,833
You can re-engage
as soon as I leave the consulate.

331
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:09,277
But only on a covert basis. Masks on,
non-lethal force. You understand?

332
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,635
We'll be here.

333
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,793
- <i>I'm going in. Any change on infrared?</i>
- Negative.

334
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,836
We'll monitor in real time.

335
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:58,111
The alarm system's a Cambria model three.
I'm jumping the release of the door now.

336
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,430
Roger that.

337
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,438
All right, Jack, stop.

338
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:24,116
We have somebody approaching from
your west side, I repeat, your west side.

339
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,589
<i> OK, he's moving away. </i>

340
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,316
Gimme the status on the other guards.

341
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,471
Jack, you're right on top of 'em.

342
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:01,838
<i>We have someone approaching</i>
<i>from your north side. </i>

343
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,911
<i>OK, you're clear. </i>

344
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,754
- I got him.
- <i> Roger that. </i>

345
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:01,478
People moving towards you on both floors.

346
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:07,908
Exiting the consulate.
Hostiles in pursuit. Bring up the van now.

347
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,991
Go, go, go, go!

348
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,794
Ow!

349
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,959
Let's go.

350
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,316
He's been hit. Pass me a medical bag. Now!

351
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,473
- We're in.
- Go, go!

352
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,111
- Jack, give me your status.
- We're away, Lee's in custody.

353
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:29,237
- He's shot in the back. No exit wound.
- How bad is it?

354
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:32,437
Can't tell. Doesn't look too severe.
We're on our way.

355
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:37,548
- We're about 15 minutes out.
- <i>All right, I'll have Medical ready. </i>

356
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:43,428
- He doesn't want you to touch him.
- Tell him I need to check his wound.

357
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,796
Hold him down. Hold him down, now!

358
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:59,429
You need to calm him down
so I can talk to him.

359
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,671
Medical assistance is waiting
and this will ease the pain.

360
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,393
- Does he understand?
- Yes.

361
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,518
That's great. Thank you very much.

362
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:35,435
Hey. The FAA's cleared us to leave at
eight o'clock on a medical transport plane.

363
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:39,991
- Dr Besson's agreed to accompany us.
- That's great news.

364
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:43,709
As soon as you settle in
I'll start looking for an apartment.

365
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:46,075
I don't know what to say.

366
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:56,155
- I'm gonna get through this.
- I know you will.

367
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,036
Raines.

368
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:06,398
<i> I have your flight information. A</i>
<i>medevac will be there to pick you up at 0630.</i>

369
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:13,276
- You're gonna take care of the transportation.
- <i>Yes, ma'am, that's correct... </i>

370
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:17,877
I gotta call you back. Paul?

371
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:20,520
Paul, what is it? Paul?

372
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:24,752
Dr Besson! Please, someone come quickly!

373
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:27,991
OK, OK, OK. It's OK, he's right here.

374
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,275
Ten milligrams vasopressin.

375
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:33,750
He just started gasping,
I don't know what's going on.

376
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,115
I can barely hear his heart.

377
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:41,669
- All signs point to a cardiac tamponade.
- What does that mean?

378
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:46,834
The sac round his heart is filling with blood.
We can drain it, we gotta get him to surgery.

379
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:50,037
If we don't stop the bleeding,
his heart will not function.

380
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:54,272
- It's OK.
- Get the pericardial centesis tray now.

381
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:05,350
I need to roll him on his back.

382
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,431
There.

383
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,193
Tell him we know
he helped Marwan with the warhead,

384
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:15,989
and we need him to help us find Marwan
before he can detonate it.

385
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,355
If he denies it, tell him we can prove it.

386
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:33,238
He doesn't deny it. He knows where Marwan
is, he'll tell you if you agree to terms.

387
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:35,436
What are they?

388
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:49,636
He was seeking protection
from our government as well as Marwan.

389
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:54,794
Marwan wants to kill him to prevent him from
talking. He wants our guarantee of protection.

390
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,952
Tell him if the information
leads us to the warhead in time,

391
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:03,194
he will be immune from prosecution
and I will take him wherever he wants to go.

392
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:16,994
He wants a guarantee of this
in writing from the president.

393
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:21,710
Tell him I understand that and I give him
my word. But I need the information now.

394
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,749
He says guarantee first.

395
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:33,038
That's not good enough. One minute.
This is... This is Bauer.

396
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:36,157
- <i> Jack, I have President Palmer. </i>
- Put him through.

397
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,597
Jack, Buchanan told me you've got Lee Jong
in custody, and that he was wounded.

398
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,875
- <i>Yes, sir. </i>
- Is he talking?

399
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,714
He won't until he has a written guarantee
he won't be prosecuted.

400
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:52,272
We also have to provide safe travel. His
guarantee has to be signed by the president.

401
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:56,478
Jack, CTU believes the detonation
of this warhead is imminent.

402
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:59,711
- Can you force him to talk immediately?
- I don't think so.

403
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:04,430
I think the fastest way to make this happen
is to give him what he wants.

404
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,272
OK.

405
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:09,875
I'll get the guarantee from Logan
and have it waiting at CTU.

406
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,075
Thank you, sir.

407
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:19,592
- What is it?
- Su Ming, the deputy Chinese consul.

408
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:23,832
- They didn't waste any time.
- They have to know we're behind the attacks.

409
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,956
What should I tell them?

410
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:28,315
I'll take the call.

411
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:32,837
We have to start fencing with them
sooner or later. Might as well be now.

412
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:36,959
Mr Lee won't talk unless he has a guarantee
of immunity and safe transport.

413
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:39,508
Get that from Logan, will you?

414
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,550
- Mr Su.
- Yes.

415
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,790
- Is this President Palmer?
- <i>Yes. </i>

416
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,919
Has the premier responded to the consul's
request to have Mr Lee turned over?

417
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,879
Mr President. The consul is dead.

418
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,671
- What?
- He was shot,

419
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:16,551
when armed men broke into this building
and took Mr Lee with them by force.

420
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,949
I am shocked and deeply saddened.

421
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:22,077
Please convey that
to your government on behalf of mine.

422
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:28,269
Mr President. Is it your position that
you have no knowledge of this operation?

423
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:32,478
That the timing of your call and this
abduction is entirely coincidental?

424
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:36,348
The consulate is sovereign territory
of the People's Republic of China.

425
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:40,149
I can't believe anyone connected
with this country had a hand in it.

426
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:44,279
I'm sure you understand the political
ramifications if you are incorrect.

427
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:48,194
I'm sure you understand the
ramifications of unproven accusations.

428
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:51,431
No accusations
have been made, Mr President.

429
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:54,910
But I can assure you
there will be an investigation.

430
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,117
Your government will have
my complete cooperation.

431
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,350
Thank you, Mr President.

432
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:03,273
I'm sure you'll be hearing from us again.

433
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,316
Very soon.

434
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:27,877
President Logan will provide Lee
with a written guarantee,

435
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:30,713
as long as it remains covert.

436
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,151
Sir?

437
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,231
What's wrong?

438
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:44,193
Koo Yin was killed
in the course of the abduction.

439
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:48,597
My God! By one of our own people?

440
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:53,196
No. It must have been friendly fire,
but it really doesn't matter.

441
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:56,317
If they're able to find proof
that we were involved,

442
00:33:56,400 --> 00:34:01,599
in the long run the repercussions will be as
serious as those we face with the terrorists.

443
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,551
Tony.

444
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:10,636
I just heard that Lee Jong is on his way here
and he's been shot. How did this happen?

445
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:14,599
The Chinese weren't gonna give Lee up
in time, so Jack had to extract him.

446
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:18,150
Jack went into the consulate?
On whose authority?

447
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,310
The White House.

448
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:27,200
Why is this the first I'm hearing about this?

449
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,636
This needed to be off the books,
to make sure it was deniable.

450
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:35,714
- But you knew about it.
- Yes, I did. I ran tactical from here.

451
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:43,829
It is absolutely unacceptable
I was kept out of the loop on this.

452
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:50,359
- That's the way Jack wanted to play it.
- You don't work for Jack! You work for me.

453
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:55,908
A situation, frankly, I wish
I'd been consulted on in the first place.

454
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,514
- Meaning?
- It was a mistake to reinstate you.

455
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,989
Now I'm certain of it.

456
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:05,437
Look, I understand you don't
appreciate being kept in the dark,

457
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,239
but I think this is about something else.

458
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:14,077
Well, you're wrong about that too.
And you were way out of line!

459
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,595
OK, thank you.
Tell him we're almost there.

460
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:25,877
The medical assistance
and the guarantee are waiting for him.

461
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:34,630
<i>- </i>
<i>- </i>

462
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,518
- I can't understand him.
- Ask him if he's in pain.

463
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,072
He says he's cold, very cold.

464
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,510
What's going on, Jack?

465
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:52,238
He must have severe internal bleeding.

466
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:55,434
- His lungs are full of fluid.
- I'll alert CTU.

467
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:59,229
Mr Lee. Mr Lee.
Tell me where Habib Marwan is.

468
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,356
Please, tell me where he is now.

469
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,273
Dammit, we're losing him.

470
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:16,110
All right, stand by with the gurney.
We're coming in hot.

471
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,276
Jack.

472
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,510
Jack, what's going on?

473
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:54,194
- Jack?
You can't come in here.

474
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:57,352
- He's dying!
- So's he. Get out, I just started this.

475
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:00,512
This is our only connection
to a stolen warhead. Save him.

476
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,591
- I'll get to him.
- He won't make it.

477
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:06,036
- I already have a patient!
- Curtis.

478
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,556
- You have a new one.
- Are you crazy?

479
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:15,395
This is the only man who can find the
missing warhead and stop it being detonated.

480
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:18,836
If you don't save him, millions
will die. Do you understand?

481
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:21,593
Millions of people.
Start working on him now!

482
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:26,435
- Jack, what are you doing?
- If I walk away from Mr Raines now, he'll die.

483
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,511
- You don't know that for sure.
- Jack!

484
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,318
Do it.

485
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,277
Now!

486
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,833
- More volume.
- Yes, doctor.

487
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:40,311
Jack, please. Please don't do this.

488
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:50,996
His lungs are damaged.
He's lost a lot of blood.

489
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:53,640
Stabilise him so I can talk to him.
Can you do that?

490
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:57,190
- Maybe. Beborah, I need you over here.
- What about Mr Raines?

491
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,669
Chest compressions if his pressure drops.

492
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,911
I got it.
- Put some gloves on.

493
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,719
Jack. Jack!

494
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,917
I have my orders.
I'm doing my job.

495
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,719
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry? You're letting him die!

496
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,268
- Get her away from me now.
- Stop it, Jack!

497
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,351
Jack, stop! He saved our lives.

498
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:24,468
He has a tension pneumo,
we have to relieve the pressure immediately.

499
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:28,348
Let go of me! Jack, listen to me.
Please, stop this.

500
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:31,955
Jack, please, please,
I'm begging you, Jack, stop it!

501
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:35,828
OK, let go of me. Please!

502
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,390
Jack, Paul's crashing. Starting CPR.

503
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:45,831
What can we do for him?
What can we do for him?

504
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:49,469
He's in V-fib. Use the defibrillator.

505
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:57,758
Charging.
Come on, buddy.

506
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,556
Clear.

507
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,830
- Come on.
Hit him again, Jack.

508
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:09,036
Charging.

509
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:12,308
Clear.

510
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:16,633
- He's still flatlining.
- Give him epinephrine.

511
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:20,030
- Where is it?
- It's on the tray, second syringe on the left.

512
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:24,477
Got it.
Inject it in the IV.

513
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,595
It's in.
- Come on, please, Paul.

514
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,877
Jack.

515
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,835
Jack. He's dead.

516
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:55,955
- Jack...
- No.

517
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:58,600
- Jack!
- No!

518
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,830
He's gone.

519
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:27,033
Oh, my God.

520
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:41,837
You son of a bitch, Jack, you son of a bitch!
You killed him! He saved your life.

521
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:45,117
- Get her out of here now.
- How could you? You killed him!

522
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:49,352
I hate you, Jack, you killed him!
How could you do this?

523
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:52,716
You killed him, Jack.
You killed him!

524
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:58,113
Paul... Let go of me!

525
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:02,954
Get off me!
Take your hands off, let go of me...

526
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,311
Suture.

527
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:15,468
- Is he gonna make it?
- I'm doing the best I can.

528
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:58,631
