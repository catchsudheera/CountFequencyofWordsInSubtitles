1
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:18,600
Right now, terrorists are plotting
to assassinate a presidential candidate.

2
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,080
My wife and daughter have been targeted.

3
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:25,080
And people that I work with
may be involved in both.

4
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:31,080
I'm Federal Agent Jack Bauer,
and today is the longest day of my life.

5
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,760
Last night I received a phone call regarding
my son, Keith, and my daughter, Nicole.

6
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:43,880
That call has unfortunately set off a chain
of events that has culminated in a tragedy.

7
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:49,040
I'm your friend - you told me so yourself
- so you're gonna have to trust my judgment.

8
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,960
- Your daughter. Where is she?
- I don't know.

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,400
- What you gonna do?
- What do you think?

10
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,920
You're gonna rip 'em off.

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,960
- Where's the money?
- I got your money. All right, stand down!

12
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,800
- What you gonna do now, man? Kill us?
- Yeah.

13
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,440
You have the right to remain silent.

14
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,840
Arrest all of 'em.

15
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,480
- Where you headed?
- Saugus.

16
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,560
Alexis paid this guy to knock the power out
at a specific address. I wanna know why.

17
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,760
Correct me if I'm wrong, but this day
basically boils down to a personal vendetta

18
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,040
against you and Palmer by the Drazens.

19
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:35,880
Yes.

20
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:39,240
Any ideas on why the Serbs'd
wanna spend this much money

21
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,320
to turn the power off
in the middle of the woods?

22
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,960
Someone knows we're here.

23
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,680
Jack, I take back what I said.
It's getting dull.

24
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,160
- That helicopter made a flyby for a reason.
- Maybe, maybe not.

25
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,800
Come here and help me with this.

26
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,400
One, two, three.

27
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,440
There's nothin' here. We're wasting our time.

28
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:04,400
Alexis tried to pay a power-company official
to cut off the electricity at 7.20 for a reason.

29
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,040
There's something here that they want.

30
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,160
Mason.

31
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:18,400
Excellent news. Half an hour. OK,
don't let anyone in or out until we get there.

32
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,720
Alexis Drazen just got out of surgery.
We ought to be there.

33
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:26,280
- You go ahead.
- Jack, we were fed misinformation.

34
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:29,600
The address in the file, the time
Morgan gave you, the whole thing.

35
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,040
- Look around. There's nothin' here. Nothin'.
- Maybe.

36
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,280
But you're gonna stick around anyway.

37
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,920
It's three minutes after seven, George.
I wanna be here at 7.20.

38
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:46,400
Look, you can send a car back for me, OK?
I promise I won't disappear on you.

39
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,080
I don't have time to argue with you.

40
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,200
Oh, my God!

41
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,280
Stay right here. Stay right there, Teri.

42
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,080
- Who the hell was that guy?
- I don't know.

43
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,720
Teri? Teri, it's OK. I'm right here.

44
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,560
It's OK.

45
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,920
Teri, listen to me, take a breath.

46
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,640
I can't. I can't!

47
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,640
I saw the car explode. There was nothing left!

48
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,840
Hey. Hey! Kim is alive.

49
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,920
She got out before the explosion.
I talked to her.

50
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,240
She was fine. She was worried about you.

51
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:48,680
Now, I need your help.
I need to get you back to CTU. Come on.

52
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,880
- Oh, my God.
- I need your help, Teri. Come on.

53
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:55,000
What did she say?
What did she say when you talked to her?

54
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,800
- Where is she?
- We don't know. She wouldn't tell us.

55
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,960
After the safe house, she didn't trust us.
I don't blame her.

56
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:06,600
- We have to find her! Tony, we have to...
- Believe me, we're looking. Get in the car!

57
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,000
Where's Jack?
Does he know what's happening?

58
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,480
He's out on an assignment.
I should hear from him soon, though.

59
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,400
- Myers.
- It's me. I found Teri at the Bauer house.

60
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:37,400
Somebody tried to kill her, but I took him
down. Send a team in case he's got backup.

61
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,360
- Is she all right?
- She will be.

62
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,960
She seems to have suffered some temporary
memory loss. She's got a friend with her, too.

63
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:48,400
- I guess a good one by the way he's acting.
- Wait. Are you sure? Who is this guy?

64
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:52,680
His name's Phil Parslow. She vouches for
him. Apparently she's known him a long time.

65
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,600
- He was hit, but not too badly.
- OK. Where are you now?

66
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,360
20, 30 minutes away.

67
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,120
Take him to the clinic. I'll send someone
to question him. Bring Teri here.

68
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,800
OK.

69
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:12,600
- Don't I get a phone call?
- Lock 'em down. Come on.

70
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,560
- Look, I need to talk to someone.
- Yeah, don't we all!

71
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,480
Don't listen to the bitch. She lies.

72
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,960
You're gonna get a chance for that after we
put you through. Come with me. You're mine.

73
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,760
They're gonna ask you about Frank...
and the deal.

74
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,760
I don't know about Frank or the deal.

75
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,960
Tell 'em that. You were just
at the wrong place at the wrong time.

76
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:49,280
I think I should tell them about everything
else, too. I mean, what happened today.

77
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,600
After the safe house,
I'm not sure if I can trust anybody.

78
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,400
- You trust me, right?
- Yeah, and look where it got me.

79
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,920
Yes, I trust you, and I know
you're trying to do the right thing.

80
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,200
OK, then listen to me. Tell 'em everything.

81
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,840
What happened at the safe house
has nothin' to do with this.

82
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:14,120
Whatever you tell them, I'll back it up.
Including my part in it.

83
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,640
- You're gonna get in trouble.
- Then I'll get in trouble.

84
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,440
It's about time I faced up to what I did.

85
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,120
All right.

86
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,920
You're up.

87
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,920
How are you feelin'?

88
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I'm fine, Daddy.

89
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,520
Relieved, actually.

90
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:26,560
I think that maybe... living with a secret
is harder work than I thought.

91
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,240
I'd be lying to you if I told you
the hard work was over.

92
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:39,280
You're gonna be asked some questions -
we all are - that we'd rather not deal with.

93
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,360
But if we stick together, we'll get through it.

94
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,320
Would you give your mother
and me a few minutes?

95
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,720
I'm sorry.

96
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,080
I, uh...

97
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,600
didn't mean to interrupt your... celebration.

98
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,200
You could've joined it.

99
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:46,160
Well, I'm not in the mood to celebrate
the end of your campaign, David.

100
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:53,280
- You just gave your concession speech.
- That remains to be seen.

101
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,080
Do you really think people want a president

102
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:04,760
who acts like some guest on a bad afternoon
talk show, confessing his sins publicly?

103
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:08,920
It's always possible
that they want someone honest.

104
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:15,840
- Mike seems to think I still have a shot.
- It's his job to tell you what you wanna hear.

105
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,080
Mine... is to tell you the truth.

106
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,160
You're not qualified to tell me the truth.

107
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:31,200
It took 13 minutes for you to tear apart
everything that it took us 25 years to build.

108
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:34,320
Why don't you just let me
mourn that loss, OK?

109
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,720
Fair enough.

110
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:46,040
I only hope your conscience comforts you
when you finally realise this is all over.

111
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,120
You mean the campaign or us?

112
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:27,120
- Confirm, Alpha One.
- This is Alpha One.

113
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,880
- Bauer's gone below.
- Positive it was Bauer?

114
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,560
Yes.

115
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,440
- What's he doing here?
- He wasn't invited, that's for sure.

116
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:00,200
- My name is Jack Bauer, and I work for C...
- CTU.

117
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:05,480
I know who you are. I checked you out.
My name is DeSalvo. DOD.

118
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:09,840
Whatever this place is, it's obvious
that no one's supposed to know it's here.

119
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,040
Well, you seem to have found it OK.

120
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:17,720
This is a prison facility - class-three detention
centre. So what the hell are you doin' here?

121
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:22,160
At 8am this morning there was
an assassination attempt on Senator Palmer.

122
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:27,320
I'm the lead investigator. I was following
a thread. The thread led me here.

123
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,960
I need more than that.

124
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:35,480
The people that want Palmer dead
bribed someone from the power company

125
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:38,560
to shut down the electricity
to the grid you're hooked into.

126
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,520
They were ordered to do this at 7.20.

127
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:47,120
Something's gonna happen
here then, isn't it?

128
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,680
Mr. DeSalvo, you better listen to me.

129
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,680
The people that are behind this
assassination attempt are ex-military Serbs.

130
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,360
They work for the Drazen family.
They've killed a lot of people today,

131
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,560
and they'll kill a lot more unless we do
something. So, sir, I will ask one more time.

132
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:06,800
What is happening here at 7.20?

133
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:17,320
- A prisoner is being delivered by chopper.
- Who?

134
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:21,720
His identity's classified even from me.
They move him every few weeks.

135
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:25,320
What do these... Drazens
want with him, anyway?

136
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,920
It's hard to tell
unless I know who the prisoner is.

137
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,840
They might wanna kill him,
they might wanna set him free.

138
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:34,920
Either way, you got about five minutes.
You'd better call for backup.

139
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,640
- Backup can't get here in five minutes.
- Call anyway.

140
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:41,280
If I'm wrong, you've gone through
a little trouble. I'll take the heat.

141
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,960
If I'm right, you've potentially
saved every life in this building.

142
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,640
Please.

143
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,680
Yeah, have Wykoff call me ASAP.

144
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,880
Thank you. What's your personnel here?

145
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,800
Three guards,
plus a maintenance man, two technicians.

146
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:09,200
- Are they weapons-trained?
- No, the civilians have never fired a weapon.

147
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:13,680
The Drazens don't know that. Issue them
full service gear. Have them stand by.

148
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:18,120
- To do what, exactly?
- To make this place look more secure.

149
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,400
At least until backup arrives.

150
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,440
It's almost time. Three minutes.

151
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:42,600
- You still haven't heard from your brother?
- No.

152
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:45,320
He didn't verify meeting the man
from the power company.

153
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,400
If there was a problem, he would've called.

154
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:55,320
You seem anxious, Harris. I thought
professionals didn't get anxious.

155
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,720
Professionals get very anxious
when a plan goes off the tracks.

156
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,800
- There's nothing wrong.
- Then what's Bauer doing here?

157
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,480
Just get your men ready. It's time.

158
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,680
Hey. Come here.

159
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,880
- No. Like this.
- All right, let's get moving.

160
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,800
Keep your stock in tight, keep your
weapon down. You're gonna be all right.

161
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,800
- Any word on the backup?
- They're lookin' into it.

162
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,840
Weapon.

163
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,640
- We good?
- Yes, sir.

164
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,280
- Let's go.
- All right.

165
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,640
Put your men in front of the lights
so they can be seen!

166
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,360
Form a line right in front of the lights!

167
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:47,320
Look like you're ready for somethin'.

168
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,920
45 seconds.

169
00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:01,480
You said there'd be a warden and three
guards. I count eight, including Bauer.

170
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,400
- They're expecting us, Andre.
- Doesn't matter.

171
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:11,880
The power's going down in 25 seconds.
The sudden darkness will disorient them.

172
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,680
- What if there is no darkness?
- There will be.

173
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,520
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

174
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,600
Eight more seconds.

175
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,560
Five... four...

176
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,840
three... two... one.

177
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,840
- The perimeter lights are still on.
- Dammit!

178
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,720
- All right, we're still going.
- No. Security is twice what we anticipated.

179
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,680
The lights are on. We'll be cut to pieces.

180
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:57,600
- Get ready to move.
- We have to stand down.

181
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:01,560
- My money, my decision.
- My crew. They'll obey my orders.

182
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,840
- All right.
- Plans have changed. Stand down.

183
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:02,400
- Sit down.
- My father is Jack Bauer.

184
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,240
Sit.

185
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,480
He's the director of
the Los Angeles bureau of CTU.

186
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:18,440
- Counter Terrorist Unit. Have you heard of it?
- I can't say that I have.

187
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,680
Do you want the number?

188
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:25,680
Look, what I want is
information on Frank Allard

189
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:30,160
and his plans to buy and distribute
1,000 hits of ecstasy. That's it.

190
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,560
I don't know him. I met him
for the first time a couple of hours ago.

191
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:46,360
Do you know that someone tried
to kill David Palmer this morning?

192
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,640
- Yeah.
- Aren't you curious how I know about it?

193
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:54,480
I don't know. Maybe because
it's been on the news the last 12 hours.

194
00:21:54,560 --> 00:22:00,200
I didn't realise. I was kidnapped. By the same
people who were tryin' to kill Senator Palmer.

195
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,920
I know this sounds crazy,
but they kidnapped my mother

196
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,800
and tried to get my father to help them,
but he rescued us.

197
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:11,280
Then he dropped you off at Frankie's so you
could earn spending money dealing drugs?

198
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:15,200
No. No. They brought us to a safe house,
but it was attacked,

199
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,480
and I think they captured my mother again.

200
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:22,960
OK. You know, she told me you had
an active imagination. She wasn't kidding.

201
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:26,360
- Who?
- Your friend. The one we picked you up with.

202
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,120
- Melanie?
- Mm-hm.

203
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,560
No! No. She's not my friend.
She thinks I'm after her boyfriend.

204
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:34,720
You can't believe anything
she says about me.

205
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:41,280
I'm gonna stick you back in the holding cell.
Maybe it'll convince you not to screw around.

206
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:45,720
Call this number. Tell them that I am
Jack Bauer's daughter and that I'm here.

207
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,800
Ask them if they think I'm screwing around.

208
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,800
Come on.

209
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:04,320
Wait. Just because they haven't attacked yet
doesn't mean they're not going to.

210
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,080
Maybe. Maybe this is a crock
and there's nobody there.

211
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:10,600
Drazen's crew is out there.
They didn't get the power to shut down.

212
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:15,400
They're working on their contingency plan.
Trust me, I know these people.

213
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:20,360
- There's not much else I can do.
- There is. Let me talk to that prisoner.

214
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:25,080
No. Access is something I can't give. My
orders are explicit. I can't even speak to him.

215
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:29,680
Everything happening here is connected to
the assassination attempt on Senator Palmer.

216
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:34,160
If you do not let me interrogate that prisoner,
you're putting the senator's life in danger.

217
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,720
Listen, Bauer, you are welcome to go over
my head if you want, but I can't help you.

218
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,200
Now, I gotta process this guy.

219
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:45,040
- Wait. You said you work for the DOD, right?
- And?

220
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,160
Can I borrow your phone?

221
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:55,200
I wanna clear every interview Nicole gives.

222
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:59,480
Yes, personally.
Whenever possible, I wanna be there.

223
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,560
Let me know.

224
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:06,800
So, is it as bad
as Sherry said it would be?

225
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:11,280
...predicted a sharp drop in Senator Palmer's
numbers, it's not turning out that way.

226
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:16,560
Instant polls indicate that the senator's base
of support is holding steady in most areas,

227
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,840
and in some cases it's actually increasing.

228
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:24,840
When asked if his disclosures made them
more likely to vote for him in the election,

229
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:29,200
less likely or made no difference at all,
60 per cent said "no difference",

230
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:34,240
22 per cent said "more likely",
while only 18 per cent said "less likely".

231
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,640
Looks like you were right, David.

232
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:41,520
...seemed to indicate that voters
approved of Senator Palmer's honesty

233
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:46,440
before a national television audience
a little more than a half-hour ago.

234
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:50,240
Senator. It's a Jack Bauer. He says it's urgent.

235
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,760
Thank you. Jack, it's me.
Did you get anything from Alexis Drazen?

236
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:59,720
No. He's coming out of surgery now, but
I did follow up a lead we got from his hotel.

237
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,880
- I'm gonna need your help.
- Go on.

238
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:05,840
I'm at a class-three detention facility.
It's a prison that doesn't exist,

239
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:08,920
- and neither does its new prisoner.
- Who's the prisoner?

240
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,480
That's where I need your help.
This is run by the Department of Defense.

241
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:17,160
- You want me to pull some strings?
- I need access to the prisoner.

242
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,720
The facility's in Saugus
at the address you gave me.

243
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:24,160
The warden's name is DeSalvo.
He's a reasonable guy, but his hands are tied.

244
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,720
- I'll do what I can.
- Thank you, sir.

245
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,920
Come on, you son of a bitch, turn around.

246
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:16,080
- That prisoner's identity is classified!
- I need to know who that prisoner is.

247
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,760
No.

248
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,520
That's impossible.

249
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,400
You recognise him?

250
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:37,360
- That's Victor Drazen.
- Who is he?

251
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,720
The man I killed two years ago.

252
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,880
All right, listen, Bauer. You're asking me
to risk my job, maybe go to jail.

253
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,960
I need some quid pro quo.
What's your connection to this guy?

254
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,880
What I'm about to tell you
is secured information.

255
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,960
Two years ago
a congressional subcommittee

256
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:21,600
decided Victor Drazen was
the key threat to the peace in Bosnia.

257
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:25,040
So they authorised a mission
to take him out. I led that mission.

258
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,120
When we got there, things went wrong.

259
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:31,040
Today I found out that Drazen's wife
and daughter were killed in the attack.

260
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:34,120
I thought we'd killed Drazen,
but apparently I was wrong.

261
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,480
So now his sons wanna break him out.

262
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,840
And they wanna exact a revenge on me.

263
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:43,800
His people kidnapped my wife and daughter.
We got them back. They're safe for now.

264
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:49,360
But if Drazen escapes, I lose any leverage
I've got of keeping his people from my family.

265
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:53,600
- I'll make another call.
- We don't have time for calls.

266
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:57,200
We need to take this prisoner
and move him ourselves now.

267
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,520
I said I'll make a call.

268
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:07,280
- We still need to cut the power.
- But your brother hasn't contacted us yet.

269
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,600
He would have called by now...

270
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:12,120
if he were alive.

271
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:16,840
We should assume Alexis is dead.
There may be another way, though.

272
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:21,680
The substation for this sector's
a half-mile from here.

273
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:25,000
A few ounces of C-5 should be sufficient.

274
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:28,080
To save time, we'll go in through the front.

275
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,760
The idea is not to attract attention.

276
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,840
The idea is to get my father out of prison.

277
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:40,040
This is the best chance we'll ever have.

278
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:48,200
- These don't match.
- Uh-huh.

279
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:51,600
Hold on. Where's Jack?
I thought he was with you.

280
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:54,240
- He opted to stay in the field. Literally.
- In Saugus?

281
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:58,200
- Yeah, the address from the Drazen file.
- Why didn't he come back with you?

282
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:02,080
I don't know. He's a stubborn guy.
He insisted on staying.

283
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:06,480
Meanwhile, Alexis Drazen came to at the
hospital, so I headed there to interrogate him.

284
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:10,760
I cut off his morphine supply, so
he should be pretty chatty in about an hour.

285
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:14,120
You didn't tell Jack about his family,
did you? What are you doing?

286
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:17,840
What are you doing? The last time I checked,
it wasn't in my job description

287
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:20,800
to have to explain myself to my subordinates.

288
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,680
Now, unless they've called off
the hit on Palmer's life,

289
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:27,320
you should be working on securing
his agenda for the rest of the day.

290
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:30,600
Looks like he's going to be
our next president.

291
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:46,040
Senator Palmer has carried New York,
and with polls closing shortly in California,

292
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:50,840
it now appears that Senator Palmer
will maintain his lead...

293
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:56,240
Hey. Everyone's outside
celebrating the latest poll.

294
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,040
Come on out, sweetheart.

295
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:11,040
What is it, David? What's wrong now?

296
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:15,320
Before, when you said it was over,

297
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:19,360
and I asked you what you meant,
the campaign or me...

298
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:24,640
What I said came out of wanting to protect
my family, wanting to protect you.

299
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,040
You can't hold that against me.

300
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,360
Sherry...

301
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,880
you're an amazing woman.

302
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,040
Smart, determined, sure of yourself.

303
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,880
You always know what you want.

304
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:46,200
But you don't want me, not really.

305
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:52,400
I don't think you've wanted me
for a very long time.

306
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,480
- That's nonsense.
- Is it?

307
00:31:55,640 --> 00:32:01,760
Maybe if everything with Nicole and Keith
never happened... but it did happen.

308
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:05,920
And you kept the truth from me
for all these years.

309
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,880
I don't think you could've done that
without pulling away.

310
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,280
And now...

311
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:25,960
now I can't help thinking
that I don't trust you any more.

312
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,800
And if I can't trust you...

313
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,040
how could I love you?

314
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,480
Well, David...

315
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:49,840
you may not love me,
but you will never leave me.

316
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:02,560
You take all the time you need
to get yourself together

317
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,880
and then you come out
and you greet all the people

318
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:10,480
who have given up every day
and every night of their lives

319
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:14,160
for the last year to put us in office.

320
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:18,080
- Us?
- Yes.

321
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,320
That's right. Us.

322
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,000
Because come January, David,

323
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,320
when you're being sworn in,

324
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,800
make no mistake about it,

325
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:36,800
this woman here will be
standing right next to you.

326
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,680
Open up two.

327
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,400
Move away from the door. Now.

328
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:33,680
OK, Martinez, settle down over there.

329
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:06,000
One thing I don't get - if Drazen was
the target, then what's he doin' here?

330
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,520
Someone thought he was
better alive than dead.

331
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,800
By "someone", you mean one of our people?

332
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:14,080
He's probably been feeding them intelligence.

333
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:18,960
Then why put you through
the charade of tryin' to kill him?

334
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:22,240
Because they wanted the rest
of the world to think he was dead.

335
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:26,800
My mission was set up to fail from the start.
I lost every man I went in there with.

336
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:33,880
DeSalvo. Yeah, he's right here.

337
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,560
- I understand.
- We got permission to move Drazen?

338
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:43,720
No. That request is still working its way up,
but DOD says you can interrogate him.

339
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,200
- Good.
- Bauer.

340
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:49,240
Five minutes.

341
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,920
Fine.

342
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,560
My name is Jack Bauer.

343
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,840
You'll have to pardon my surprise.

344
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,920
I saw you die.

345
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:39,640
I watched you enter a building.

346
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:43,240
Nobody could've survived that explosion.

347
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:54,520
Our intelligence told us the building
was empty when you entered.

348
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,680
Your fight is with me.

349
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:19,000
Not my wife, not my daughter, but with me.

350
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:24,080
Please... leave my family alone.

351
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:39,960
Mr. Drazen, you have already lost
your wife and your daughter.

352
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:43,520
You don't need to lose your sons, too.

353
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,920
My sons are soldiers.

354
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:49,360
Then they will die for nothing.

355
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,200
We know about the rescue plan.
It was scheduled for 7.20.

356
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:57,400
We stopped it. We've called in for backup.
If they try again, sir, they will die.

357
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:00,920
Then you have nothing to worry about.

358
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,240
- Call it off, Victor.
- How can I?

359
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,960
The same way you've been
communicating with them this entire time!

360
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:12,480
Call it off or your sons will die!

361
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,640
All right. We'll move him.

362
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:43,560
Is there another way out of here that's not
on the schematic? A fire or flood egress?

363
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,320
- Yes.
- Good.

364
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:49,400
- I'll get my men ready.
- Have them armed like we did before.

365
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:59,240
Get up.

366
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,960
Get up!

367
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:11,320
We're evacuating the prisoner.
Have all personnel convene in quarter C.

368
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,400
Yes, sir.

369
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:25,080
Stop.

370
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,840
- Move out.
- Let's go.

371
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,080
Get against the wall.

372
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:02,080
- The power's down in the west quadrant.
- Copy that.

373
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,160
They are here.
