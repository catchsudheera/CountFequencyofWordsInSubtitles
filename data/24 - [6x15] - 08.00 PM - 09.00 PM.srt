3
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,156
The Americans know our location.

4
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,708
We need to launch the drone
before they close in.

5
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,473
We'll find a way
to deliver the other two bombs.

6
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,039
Launch the drone.

7
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,958
- I can't find the drone.
- Use projected vectors.

8
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,110
I am. It's not where it's supposed to be.

9
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,590
Until you find it,
I'll have my F-16s stay in a holding pattern.

10
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,274
We figured out
how the drone can stay hidden.

11
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:49,115
Whoever is piloting it
can anticipate our directives.

12
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,715
Our data is being relayed to the drone pilot
through a work station here.

13
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,951
- We have a leak.
- Find who's subverting our system.

14
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:59,271
It is Nadia.
The signature trace matches her computer.

15
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,191
Surrender your station.

16
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,669
- Who are you streaming data to?
- What?

17
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,637
I will do what's necessary
to get the answers I need.

18
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,439
- Let her go.
- What the hell are you doing?

19
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,557
We got the drone pilot's location.

20
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,074
We're not through with her, Milo.

21
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,388
What's your status?

22
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:26,074
The drone pilot is down. I'm at his controls.

23
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,718
The target is San Francisco.

24
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,917
I can't deactivate the bomb.
I'm fighting a stall.

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,039
I'm losing control.
I need to find a place to land it.

26
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,116
None of the first responders are reporting
a detonation. The bomb did not go off.

27
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,192
Move out!
There's radioactive material in this area.

28
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:51,872
We took control of the aircraft,
crash-landing it at the edge of the city.

29
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:57,273
But the bomb's core was compromised
and radioactive material was released.

30
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,954
So what we're dealing with is a dirty bomb?

31
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:03,476
- Sir, it was a radiological spill.
- It was an attack on our nation.

32
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,676
I warned the ambassador, Tom.

33
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,718
We were led to believe
this warning shot would be fired

34
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,190
only in response to
the detonation of a nuclear device.

35
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:15,909
They need to see with their own eyes
that I will answer this threat

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,833
with an in-kind military response.

37
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:22,037
The order's given. Launch the missile...

38
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,236
as soon as they're in range.

39
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:36,072
- Prep two units of plasma.
- You need to keep him alive.

40
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,277
Gredenko's got two more bombs.
This man's our only link.

41
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,672
Jack, I talked to CTU. There's a situation
where the drone went down.

42
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,752
The bomb casing cracked.
It dispersed in the air.

43
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,992
- How bad is the fallout?
- Casualties should be minimal.

44
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,150
They're starting to evacuate.

45
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:58,155
Go through the pilot's databases.
See if you can find any link to Gredenko.

46
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,754
Agent Bauer, he didn't make it.

47
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,475
Dammit.

48
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,551
<i>- Buchanan.
- Bill, it's Jack.</i>

49
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,518
- What did you get from the pilot?
- Nothing, he's dead.

50
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,592
We're running down leads.
Nothing's come up on Gredenko.

51
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,069
Doyle told me the fallout was containable?

52
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:23,508
It's not that simple. The incident has created
serious policy complications in Washington.

53
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:27,195
Daniels has ordered a nuclear strike
against Fayed's country.

54
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,637
What's he trying to do? Start World War III?
It'll be seen as an act of aggression.

55
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:36,032
- We have to find Fayed and Gredenko fast.
- When is it happening?

56
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:40,079
- Within the hour.
- That doesn't give us enough time.

57
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,151
I'll get back to you.

58
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,711
<i>(ringing tone)</i>

59
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:07,068
<i>(TV) ...how an explosive device could have
been secreted into the White House bunker.</i>

60
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,720
Victor is still not answering.

61
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,473
Because the Americans found him.

62
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,791
The bomb was supposed to hit San Francisco
ten minutes ago.

63
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:22,228
- But there's nothing on the news.
- Even if you're right, we are safe here.

64
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,595
Victor doesn't know our location.

65
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:30,235
- So we can continue our operation safely.
- What operation?

66
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,472
There is no operation.
It's over because of you and your people.

67
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,630
No, Fayed, it isn't over.

68
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,349
We have two more bombs.

69
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,999
I have the bombs!

70
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,196
But you need me to deliver them.

71
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:58,354
I'm the only one who can give you
the targets you want.

72
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,555
So come on, shoot me now!

73
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,108
Or put down that gun.

74
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,471
<i>(phone rings)</i>

75
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,668
<i>- Yeah.
- (Gredenko) Mark Hauser?</i>

76
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,035
- Who's this?
- You know who it is.

77
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,471
- I already gave you what you asked for.
- But your employer has tightened security.

78
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,313
So the access I paid for is no good.

79
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,470
- That's not my problem.
- It is.

80
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:49,838
It became your problem
the moment you took my money.

81
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,836
It'll take some time to download
the new security protocols.

82
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:58,913
- How much time?
- Half an hour, maybe longer. I can call you.

83
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,390
- I'll be there in 40 minutes.
- Gredenko.

84
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,431
I'm hungry.

85
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:18,195
- Knock yourself out.
- There's peppers in here.

86
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:22,193
- You like peppers.
- Not red ones. I don't eat red food, Mark.

87
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:25,078
- Since when?
- I don't like red food.

88
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,468
I'll take the peppers out, OK?

89
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:38,752
You take care of me, Mark.
You always take care of me.

90
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,831
I do my best, Brady.

91
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:48,434
While I'm doing this,
I need you to do something for me.

92
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,954
OK.

93
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:54,919
I need you to access some files
from the mainframe in my office.

94
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,389
- Can you do that?
- Yeah.

95
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,231
Let's go.

96
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:43,029
Nadia's being processed
as an enemy combatant.

97
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,112
She's being transferred
to a holding station in Temecula.

98
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:51,479
Sir, I don't know if I can accept that
she betrayed us, that she spied for Fayed.

99
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,514
I think we're wrong.

100
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,194
This is not easy for any of us.

101
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,353
But the facts at hand indicate
she was streaming intel from her station.

102
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,396
- Mr Buchanan.
- What is it?

103
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,675
We may have caught a break.

104
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,872
What do you have?

105
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,590
I've monitored everyone who's communicated
with Gredenko, through phone or emails.

106
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,797
The filter flagged a call
that happened a few minutes ago.

107
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:20,077
Mark Hauser. He does security consulting
for energy companies.

108
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,913
His company has contracts
with chemical facilities.

109
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,719
Oil fields, pipelines and nuclear power plants.

110
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,872
The call was scrambled,
but we do have Hauser's address.

111
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,030
Get that address to Jack.

112
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,355
- You wanted to see me?
- Yeah. Excuse us, guys.

113
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,756
While I was stripping data
from the drone pilot's hard drive,

114
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,354
- I found this.
- What is it?

115
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:48,115
A remote access module. It's how the pilot
breached CTU's satellite grid.

116
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,909
No. The pilot got into our system
cos Nadia Yassir let him in.

117
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,437
No. This guy got in through one of
the radical websites Nadia's been monitoring.

118
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,670
Access module proves it.

119
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,558
Nadia's system was compromised
and she didn't know it?

120
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,438
That's right.

121
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:08,274
You're in a tough position -
you led the witch-hunt against her.

122
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:12,114
I followed standard protocols
based on information that was available.

123
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:16,955
Nadia might not see it that way when
she takes it up with the Justice Department.

124
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:22,512
Once the dust settles today,
they might wanna make you an example.

125
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:31,108
Relax, Mike, you took care of me in Denver
and I still owe you for that.

126
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,749
- We're even now.
- Copy that. I'll call when we're there.

127
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,671
- We got a lead on Gredenko.
- How good?

128
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,469
We'll know soon. It's a few miles from here.
Put together a TAC team.

129
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:44,916
I need to stay behind. We're still processing.

130
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,592
Fine.

131
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,829
- Ryan.
- Yes, sir.

132
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,912
Get your men together, come with me.

133
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,996
- Give us a minute, please.
- Yes, ma'am.

134
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,951
Sandra, how are you holding up?

135
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,679
I can't believe this is happening.

136
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,516
It doesn't feel real.

137
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,716
I'm so sorry.

138
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:57,318
Sandra, unfortunately
I need to ask you for your help.

139
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:02,119
There's an extremely volatile situation
developing at the White House.

140
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:06,318
Vice President Daniels is about to launch
a nuclear strike against the Middle East.

141
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,597
- A nuclear strike?
- Yes, and the cabinet is behind him.

142
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,069
I've tried arguing, but no one's listening.

143
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,630
- Are they insane?
- No. They're just scared.

144
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:21,431
Before the attempted assassination, Wayne
reached out to the Middle East governments

145
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:25,274
to solicit their help in stopping Fayed,
and it was working.

146
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:30,753
This strike is a complete reversal
of everything that he was working for.

147
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:34,230
You want Dr Welton
to bring him out of the coma?

148
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,392
Yes. And I need your consent.

149
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:45,635
But the doctor said he needs to be sedated
for a few days before the swelling subsides.

150
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,109
But we don't have a few days.

151
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:53,194
Even if Wayne regains consciousness,
we don't know what state he'll be in.

152
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:56,989
But we won't know unless we try.
I wouldn't dare to ask you to risk this

153
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:00,834
if I did not think it was absolutely necessary
for the sake of our country.

154
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,115
I'm sorry. I can't do it.

155
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:08,114
- Sandra, please.
- I've already lost one brother.

156
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,509
I can't lose another one.

157
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:14,559
I know you did not ask for this responsibility,
but like it or not, it is yours.

158
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,996
Wayne Palmer is still
the president of our country.

159
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,036
He's the only one who can stop this,

160
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:26,309
and you are the only one who can give him
the chance to do what he believes in.

161
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:41,069
Give him that chance.

162
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,556
Ask yourself what Wayne
would want you to do.

163
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,031
I'll talk to Dr Welton.

164
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,994
God forgive me if I'm wrong.

165
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,433
<i>USS Vickery has been detached
from carrier group Falcon,</i>

166
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,556
which is on patrol in the region.

167
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:12,111
<i>The Vickery will reach launch position
in 40 minutes.</i>

168
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,351
So in less than an hour
we'll have made our point to the enemy?

169
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,953
Yes, Mr Vice President.

170
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:23,433
The B-611 short-range tactical warhead
has a blast yield of 300 kilotons.

171
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:26,956
The message will be loud and clear.

172
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,318
Very good, Admiral. Exemplary.

173
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,438
Tom, give us the damage and
casualty estimates you got from COMPLAN.

174
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,477
- Tom?
- I'm sorry, sir.

175
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,189
- Is there a problem?
- No, no, no.

176
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:47,909
This projection is, of course,
based on theoretical models

177
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,515
generated at our nuclear facility
in Alamogordo.

178
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:56,515
COMPLAN estimates a high range
of general damage by zone,

179
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:00,912
as well as multiple casualty numbers
based on various climate models.

180
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,037
- Now, should the...
- I'm sorry, Tom.

181
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,394
I need to step out for a minute.

182
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,834
- Carry on with the briefing.
- Right.

183
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:14,276
Should the enemy mount a response,
the potential does exist

184
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,999
for the US to be drawn into a conflict
in which...

185
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,913
What does this mean?
They're taking him out of the coma?

186
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,949
Apparently Sandra Palmer
gave her consent a few minutes ago.

187
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,717
- This is Karen Hayes.
- I don't know, sir.

188
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:34,875
I only found out about this because
I have a source inside the medical bay.

189
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,358
<i>- Put me through to Dr Welton.
- (woman) Right away.</i>

190
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:46,559
I've cut the pentobarbital drip, his metabolic
rate's up. He's breathing on his own.

191
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:50,679
- What about the swelling in his brain?
- No sign of intracranial hypertension,

192
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:55,629
but it's still too early to know
when or even if he'll regain consciousness.

193
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:59,190
<i>(man) Dr Welton, Vice President Daniels
on line one. It's urgent.</i>

194
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,919
Dr Welton, what are you going to tell him?

195
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,195
The truth.

196
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,111
Mr Vice President, this is Dr Welton.

197
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,272
I'm told you're trying to rouse the president
out of his coma?

198
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:19,036
- That's correct, sir.
- I thought you induced it to save his life.

199
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,192
Treating patients with head trauma
is a fluid process.

200
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:25,556
It sounds to me like
you're risking the life of the president.

201
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,756
With care, we can minimize that risk.

202
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,400
- Let's cut the crap, Doctor.
- Sir?

203
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,153
We know why Sandra Palmer
wants her brother conscious.

204
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:36,391
- She's trying to subvert my policy.
- Policy's not my concern.

205
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,836
I think you're concerned
and that you agree with what she's doing,

206
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:43,230
and you're willing to risk the life
of the president to get it done!

207
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:46,153
So if you don't stop now,
I will compel you to stop!

208
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,437
With all due respect,
the president's treatment is not...

209
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:53,718
- You'll do what I tell you.
- No, sir. I'm sorry, I will not.

210
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:57,839
I am required to follow the wishes
of Sandra Palmer.

211
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,718
You're free to take up your concerns with her.

212
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,031
If the president dies or suffers any damage
from your actions,

213
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:07,317
I will nail your ass to the wall.
Do you understand me?

214
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,391
Perfectly, sir.

215
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,074
- Chloe, I need that photo. I need it now.
- Sending now, Jack.

216
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:44,913
<i>- Team B, advise when you're in position.
- (man) Copy, sir.</i>

217
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,349
<i>- Team B in position.
- Copy that.</i>

218
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:53,477
I've got a positive ID.
Move in on the house now.

219
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,232
<i>All teams go. Move in.</i>

220
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,117
<i>(barking)</i>

221
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:02,029
Federal agent. Down on the floor!

222
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,550
- Mark!
- Don't move!

223
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,518
- Put him in the chair.
- Mark.

224
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,194
Mark. Mark. Mark.

225
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,474
- Mark!
- It's clear.

226
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:18,472
- Take him to the living room.
- He doesn't know anything!

227
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,551
- Shut up!
- Mark. Mark.

228
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:26,276
- He's bleeding. He needs to go to hospital.
- We don't have time. Stabilize him.

229
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,396
<i>(Brady) Mark!</i>

230
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,755
Mark!

231
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,949
- Mark!
- Let me have the room.

232
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:42,429
I know you're scared right now,
but everything's gonna be OK.

233
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,715
I wanna see my brother.

234
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,837
I'll let you see him,
but I need to ask you some questions.

235
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,559
- I'm not allowed.
- You're not allowed? Why?

236
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,679
- Mark says don't talk to strangers.
- I'm not a stranger. I'm a police officer.

237
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,910
You can talk to me. It's all right.

238
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,560
My name is Jack Bauer. What's yours?

239
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,995
- Brady.
- Brady.

240
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:07,200
When we came in, you were working on
your computer. What were you working on?

241
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,477
- Getting files.
- What kind of files?

242
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:16,351
I don't know. Mark asked me to get through
the IBC firewall to set up a proxy server port.

243
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,953
Oh.

244
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,554
Can I see him now?

245
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:27,079
Soon. I'm gonna talk to him first,
and then you can see him, OK?

246
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,915
You're doing great, Brady.

247
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,835
- Stay with him.
- Yes, sir.

248
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,634
You were paid to give Gredenko information.

249
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,518
You used your brother to get it,
now he's in trouble.

250
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:48,037
- My brother's got nothing to do with this.
- That's not what he told me.

251
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,712
He doesn't know what he's doing.

252
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:54,112
That's not how the Justice Department
will see it. They'll prosecute him for treason.

253
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:58,193
I'll help your brother, cos we both know
he didn't understand what he was doing,

254
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,874
but you're gonna have to give me Gredenko.

255
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,157
What kind of information
were you selling him?

256
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,357
- Security specs.
- What security specs?

257
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,318
The Edgemont nuclear power plant.

258
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:15,955
Bill, this is Connell Johnson.
He's on loan from District.

259
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:19,430
We swept the drone pilot's system.
Most of the files are encrypted.

260
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:23,718
- Our digital forensics people are waiting.
- We'll see what we can find.

261
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:27,076
- Got anything more from Nadia?
- She still claims she was set up.

262
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:31,199
- Is she in the building?
- Yes, she's being transferred. Why?

263
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:36,593
- Just curious.
- Sir, Jack's on line two. He's got Hauser.

264
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,389
- Jack?
- Bill.

265
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:47,155
Hauser sold Gredenko security specs
for Edgemont nuclear power facility.

266
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:50,357
- Does Gredenko have them?
- He picks them up in 20 minutes.

267
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:53,079
- Can your team handle the grab?
- We have a situation.

268
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:57,631
Hauser was wounded, but he's got a brother.
We're gonna use him for the transaction.

269
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:03,875
It's the best shot we've got to get
Gredenko alive. I'll get back to you soon.

270
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:25,512
Brady, we need to talk.

271
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,430
Are you really a policeman?

272
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,389
Yeah.

273
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,517
Then my brother did something wrong.

274
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,070
He's made some mistakes,
but he's helping us fix them.

275
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:40,596
Everyone makes mistakes.
I make mistakes all the time.

276
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:43,752
- And you try and fix them, right?
- Yeah.

277
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:47,435
That's what your brother's trying to do,
but he needs your help.

278
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,954
- Why don't we go talk to him?
- OK.

279
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,471
Come on, let's go.

280
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:58,750
- Mark. Mark.
- It's OK, Brady. It's OK.

281
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:02,154
It's not as bad as it looks.

282
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,918
- They're taking me to the hospital.
- I wanna go with you.

283
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,594
- You need to stay with them.
- Don't leave me alone.

284
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:11,069
Listen to me, Brady! Listen.

285
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,951
You need to do
whatever this man tells you to do.

286
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,311
You'll be fine.

287
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:25,192
Who takes care of you, Brady?

288
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,748
- You do, Mark.
- That's right.

289
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:33,398
So you need to trust me
when I tell you you'll be fine.

290
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,071
He'll take care of you.

291
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,155
OK?

292
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,196
OK.

293
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,915
Let's make the call.

294
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,791
<i>(phone rings)</i>

295
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,071
<i>- Yes?
- It's Hauser.</i>

296
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,674
I have the protocols, but there's a problem.

297
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,193
A problem?

298
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,475
<i>My supervisor wants me to come in.</i>

299
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:13,429
- I'll be there in 20 minutes.
- He wants me at the office now.

300
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:18,196
If I'm not there in ten minutes, the protocols
will default and need downloading again.

301
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,350
I need those protocols.

302
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,073
- I can leave them with my brother.
- Brady?

303
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:28,470
Unless you wanna wait
for me to get back from the office.

304
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,551
I don't have time.

305
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:36,554
Have your brother meet me
in the parking lot across the street.

306
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,234
He'll be there. Goodbye.

307
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,512
The parking lot across the street, 20 minutes.

308
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:48,798
- He needs to get to a hospital now.
- Take him.

309
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,839
- Mark. Mark.
- Brady. It's all right, it's all right.

310
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:58,153
We're gonna take care of him. I promise. Right
now I need you to listen to me very carefully,

311
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,152
just like your brother told you to, OK?

312
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,111
OK.

313
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:18,159
Milo Pressman? Connell Johnson.
I'm on loan from District. Data forensics.

314
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,789
- Yeah, we crossed paths in Denver.
- That's right, we did.

315
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:27,398
- What can I do for you?
- I hear you and Nadia Yassir are friends.

316
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:30,790
- Yeah. Why do you ask?
- I came across evidence

317
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,917
that proves Nadia's innocent.

318
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,992
- Explain.
- She wasn't streaming intel.

319
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,355
Her system was breached.

320
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,351
- Where is this evidence?
- Ask Doyle.

321
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:46,558
- Doyle?
- I hate to rat, but I didn't know where to go.

322
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:52,795
I gave him the evidence at the crime scene
and he still hasn't logged it in.

323
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,310
- What did you do?!
- Are you crazy?

324
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,311
- Milo, that's enough!
- Tell him!

325
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,039
He's got evidence that Nadia's innocent!

326
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,429
- Is this true?
- Yeah.

327
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:07,433
- And he buried it to save his own ass.
- He didn't bury it. Milo, he didn't.

328
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:11,115
It's a remote access module
that breached Nadia's computer.

329
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,796
- He gave it to me ten minutes ago.
- Why didn't you tell us about this?

330
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:20,192
I got it from an unreliable source. I wanted
to make sure it was real before I submitted it.

331
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:24,831
I ran a verification scan. It's definitely real
and Nadia is definitely innocent.

332
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:31,473
I'll review the evidence. If it's true, I'll release
Nadia. In the meantime, go back to work.

333
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:35,308
Come with me, Morris.

334
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,436
Doyle...

335
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,031
I owe you an apology.

336
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,759
- It's not your fault.
- Still.

337
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,711
Milo, forget about it.

338
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,911
Johnson.

339
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:03,596
You've screwed with the wrong guy
for the last time, pal.

340
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,995
Uncuff her.

341
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,151
Excuse us, please.

342
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:49,310
We found evidence at the switching station.

343
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:54,155
It proves your computer was breached
from an outside source.

344
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,470
You're cleared, Nadia.

345
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,794
I'm sorry this happened.

346
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,760
So am I.

347
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,718
Your first impulse will be to quit.

348
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,831
Take legal action.

349
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,791
I don't blame you.

350
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,871
That's what I'd do.

351
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,315
But I'm asking you to stay.

352
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:26,550
This crisis is far from over.
We can't afford to lose our best people.

353
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,237
We need you, Nadia.

354
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,879
I'll stay.

355
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,633
Milo's setting up your work station now.

356
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:51,399
I sent the assault vectors. Nadia is good to go.

357
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,118
Thank you.

358
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,192
We all thought she was guilty.
This is gonna be awkward.

359
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,759
Yeah.

360
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,229
Especially for you.

361
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,993
Why especially for me?

362
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:07,392
Your feelings for Nadia
aren't exactly a big secret.

363
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:10,631
Thank you for pointing that out.

364
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,838
Your station's all set. Comm's up.

365
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:36,909
- You have full security access to the subnet.
- Thanks.

366
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,231
- Listen, Nadia...
- I don't have time for a heart-to-heart.

367
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,039
I've got a lot of catching up to do.
Excuse me.

368
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,918
I understand that. Nadia, wait.

369
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,958
Dammit, you're not gonna
make this easy for me, are you?

370
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:53,477
You know what? I am. Whatever you thought
might happen between us, you can forget it.

371
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:56,996
- That's not fair.
- I don't blame you for suspecting me.

372
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:03,599
But you have to admit, this is not
the best place to start a relationship.

373
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,591
You're probably right.

374
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:37,590
But I still wanted to say I'm sorry.

375
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,791
You said it.

376
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,192
I should get to work.

377
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,235
- Here.
- Thanks.

378
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:10,598
We haven't heard from Dr Welton.
He's been giving us regular updates.

379
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:14,468
I'm sure if there was something to report,
we would've heard from him.

380
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:17,757
Gosh, I've never been good
at waiting for anything.

381
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:21,310
David had the patience of Job, but not me.

382
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:25,317
Wayne is always somewhere in between.

383
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:33,358
- We have a decision to make.
- What is it?

384
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:37,353
- There's an increase in intracranial swelling.
- How serious is it?

385
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:42,309
It's not life-threatening yet, but if it continues,
it could cause permanent brain damage.

386
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:45,073
I suggest we re-induce the coma.

387
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,951
No.

388
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:54,350
- You understand the danger?
- But there's a chance he'd be OK?

389
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:57,079
Yes, there is a chance.

390
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:03,349
Well, even if it's a small chance for Wayne
to stop Daniels, then it's worth the risk.

391
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,159
I know Wayne would wanna see this through.

392
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,879
Dr Welton, you need to come quickly.

393
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,989
He's crashing. Get a code team
in here right away. Wait outside.

394
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:18,117
Code team to one. Code team to one, stat.

395
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,668
Let's get a crash cart in here.

396
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:39,079
The teams are in position.
You sure he can do this?

397
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:42,550
He just needs to get Gredenko out of his car.

398
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,470
We don't have another option.

399
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:50,838
Just tell Charlie team
they've got one shot at this.

400
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,271
Dammit.

401
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:02,149
Brady, I need you to wear one of these.
So we can talk to each other.

402
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,073
This way you'll be able to hear me
and I can hear you.

403
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:08,311
- I need to put it in your ear.
- Will it hurt?

404
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,789
No. No, I promise.

405
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:17,314
See? Now I'm gonna talk you through this.

406
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:21,075
But we don't want Mr Gredenko
to know that you can hear me,

407
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:24,550
so we have to pretend that you can't,
you understand?

408
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,631
Yeah.

409
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,439
Good. You're gonna give him this.

410
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:34,153
He's gonna meet you in the parking lot.
I want you to stand on the sidewalk.

411
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,231
That's your position.

412
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,351
- OK.
- We're set.

413
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,635
We should go now.

414
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,635
You don't need to be scared, Brady.

415
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:05,430
I'm gonna watch you the whole time
and I'm gonna hear everything that you say.

416
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:08,080
Go to your position.
Remember your position?

417
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:11,232
- Yeah, I'll go to my position.
- OK.

418
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,590
- Teams, report in.
- Alpha team in position.

419
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,989
- Bravo team in position.
- Charlie team in position.

420
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:30,312
Charlie team, you are responsible for taking
out Gredenko with the tranquillizer dart.

421
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:36,077
Teams A and B, acquire remaining targets.
Do whatever you have to to protect this kid.

422
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,589
- Brady, it's Jack. Can you hear me?
- I hear you.

423
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:48,116
- You're doing great.
- When can I see my brother?

424
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,350
As soon as this is over. I promise.

425
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,954
OK, OK. Good.

426
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,555
<i>(radio chatter)</i>

427
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:08,039
I have a visual on Gredenko's SUV.
Windows are tinted. I can't see who's inside.

428
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,680
Brady, do you see the car
coming towards you?

429
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,876
- Yeah.
- It's time to get ready.

430
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:28,391
I've got a visual on Gredenko. Charlie team,
take your shot as soon as you've got one.

431
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,471
- Do you have it?
- Yeah.

432
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,951
Give it to me.

433
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,754
I have a negative line of sight.
Hauser's in the way.

434
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,671
You look nervous, Brady.

435
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,954
Why are you so nervous?

436

<i>(Gredenko speaks Russian)</i>

437

Gredenko just gave the order to shoot the kid.

438
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:11,957
- Do you have your shot yet?
- Negative. Hauser's in the way.

439
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,235
- Can you move position?
- Negative.

440
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:19,792
Brady, don't forget to pretend
like you can't hear me. You're doing great.

441
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,677
Listen to me carefully.

442
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,309

to go down to the ground and stay there.

00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,517
Move in, move in!

451
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:02,673
Brady, are you OK?
It's over. It's over. You did great.

452
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:07,390
- I want to see my brother?
- You can see your brother, like I promised.

453
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,471
Get Gredenko in the house. Prep him.

454
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:13,439
Advise Buchanan we've got Gredenko
and we're prepping him for interrogation.

455
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,590
Yes, sir.

456
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,671
Watch your head.

457
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:42,672
Brady, this man's gonna look after you.
He's gonna take you to see your brother.

458
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:45,354
- I wanna see my brother.
- Yeah.

459
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,199
You did great. Thank you.

460
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,991
OK.

461
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,793
We searched Gredenko's vehicle.
No sign of the bombs.

462
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:15,190
- Is he conscious yet?
- Yes. You want help with him?

463
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,077
No.

464
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,350
You know who I am.

465
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,908
I know all about you, Agent Bauer.

466
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:42,352
Then you know what I'm gonna do to you,
unless you tell me where the bombs are.

467
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:47,150
And when I'm finished, I'm gonna put you
on the fastest plane we've got back to Russia.

468
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:51,597
I don't think President Suvarov's
gonna be too happy to see you.

469
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,672
- Fayed has the bombs.
- Where is he?

470
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:58,116
I don't know, but I can help you find him.

471
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,311
I'm listening.

472
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:11,632
I came here to get security specs
for the Edgemont nuclear power plant.

473
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:14,393
- That's your next target?
- Yes.

474
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,150
Fayed's waiting for my call.

475
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:22,193
Make the call.

476
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:24,191
No.

477
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,434
First, my terms.

478
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:33,789
Amnesty from your government
and a guarantee I won't be returned to Russia.

479
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,836
What?

480
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:39,070
I'm offering you Fayed.

481
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:41,549
What's the problem?

482
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:47,156
I'm not a martyr, I'm a soldier and realist.

483
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:54,998
If I don't call him soon,
Fayed will get suspicious.

484
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,636
<i>Admiral, is the Vickery ready to launch?</i>

485
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:06,678
- It's seconds from optimal launch position.
- Good.

486
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:10,230
Mr Vice President,
I just spoke to Bill Buchanan at CTU.

487
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:14,154
They've taken Gredenko into custody.
Jack Bauer is questioning him now.

488
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:18,791
- Does Bill think it could lead to something?
- He's confident Bauer's the man for it.

489
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,678
And he's hoping
they get the answers they need.

490
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,876
I hope his confidence is justified.

491
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:28,317
<i>Sir, the Vickery's in position.
They're standing by.</i>

492
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,277
Proceed with the strike.

493
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:34,194
Mr Vice President, if I may,
in light of the developments at CTU,

494
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:38,159
do we not wanna delay this launch
and see what Bauer gets out of Gredenko?

495
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:42,153
I'm not gonna delay our response based
on what Gredenko may or may not reveal.

496
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:45,437
If Gredenko gives up the bombs,
that is the desired result.

497
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:49,593
Then we can consider this strike
as retaliation for American lives already lost!

498
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:55,312
A reminder to the world there are
consequences to attacking our country.

499
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:02,232
- Admiral Smith, proceed with the launch.
- Yes, Mr Vice President.

500
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:20,548
<i>Sir, the Vickeryjust received a message
over the COMPLAN subnet.</i>

501
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,518
They've been ordered to stand down.

502
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:26,672
What the hell are you talking about?
Who gave this order?

503
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:29,593
President Palmer, sir.

504
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:32,672
<i>- President Palmer?
- (phone rings)</i>

505
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:39,193
<i>- Conference Room, Lisa Miller.
- (man) Urgent call for the vice president.</i>

506
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,316
One moment.

507
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,951
It's for you, sir.

508
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,150
Yes?

509
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,676
Noah, it's Wayne.

510
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:59,432
Mr President, it is an incredible relief
to hear your voice.

511
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:03,115
To be frank, it's a surprise.

512
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:07,671
- I've called off the strike, Noah.
- We just received word.

513
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:12,914
Sir, this action is a product
of careful deliberation

514
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,195
<i>between myself and the Joint Chiefs.</i>

515
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:20,673
Yeah, well, be that as it may,
the decision is mine and mine alone.

516
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:26,314
I'm resuming my duties
as commander in chief.

517
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:33,078
Inform Admiral Smith and the others there's
to be no action without my authorisation.

518
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:38,278
- Is that understood?
- Understood, Mr President.

519
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,991
Good.

520
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:56,235
It's apparent to me that

521
00:40:56,320 --> 00:41:02,316
the president is still suffering the effects
from the attack on his life.

522
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,392
He's not thinking clearly

523
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:08,677
and, in my judgment,

524
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:13,315
he's not capable of discharging his duties.

525
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:17,591
I can't let him remain in power.

526
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:22,749
Get me the attorney general.

527
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,757
