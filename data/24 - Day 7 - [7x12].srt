**********

5
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:16,690
jack.

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,200
Put down your weapon. Now!

7
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:20,660
What the hell's going on?

8
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:22,110
- Where's ryan burnett?
- What?

9
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,170
Senator mayer's chief
of staff-- where is he?

10
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:28,080
Tony double-backed to one of his contacts
who gave him information of a second attack.

11
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:30,720
It's gonna take place here
in washington within the hour.

12
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:32,210
Juma's operatives are carrying it out.

13
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,020
Burnett's been
supporting them all along.

14
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:35,630
He knows where the
attack's gonna take place,

15
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:39,290
so you can either tell me where
he is, or I will find him myself.

16
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,870
Mr. Burnett, you are a
traitor and a terrorist.

17
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,970
I am not. I love my country.

18
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:50,320
- mr. Bauer, this is president taylor.
- Where's the target?

19
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:53,690
What you're doing is
against the law, mr. Bauer.

20
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,360
I am ordering you to stand down.

21
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,380
Where'S...

22
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:00,790
Take mr. Bauer away. He's under arrest.

23
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,780
You should have comeo me. You
should have presented your case.

24
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:06,950
And would it really have
made a difference, ma'am?

25
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:10,690
colonel dubaku is dead.

26
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:15,190
Laurent must never know about this,
or about his father's cowardice.

27
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:16,860
There is no sign of my father.

28
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:19,260
Let me take his place
on the assault team.

29
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,220
Spoken like a true dubaku.

30
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:23,920
Laurent, it is time for us to go.

31
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:26,570
This is it, larry, no question.

32
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:27,850
They're moving out.

33
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:30,330
- Any idea what the next target is?
- No.

34
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:38,490
From our location, it is approximately
100 meters to the entrance.

35
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:13,930
********

36
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,730
let's move.

37
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,250
That's it. I need to see her right now.

38
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,900
Ms.Taylor, the president will
see you as soon as she's able.

39
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,870
Well, you tell her her
daughter is done waiting.

40
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:56,880
I'm going to the hospital
to be with my father.

41
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:00,960
I think it would be a good idea to
talk to your mother before you do that.

42
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:06,110
The president's orders are that
you remain in the white house.

43
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,040
So if I try to leave, you will
actually physically restrain me?

44
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:11,980
Oh, that would never happen, ms.Taylor,

45
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:14,940
because I know you have too
much respect for your mother

46
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:18,020
and her office to ever
let things get that far.

47
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,270
Well done, agent.

48
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:24,980
You've been at this a while.

49
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:27,730
Five administrations, ma'am.

50
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:43,000
olivia, your mother asked me to
fill you in on what's happening.

51
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,040
Well, with all due respect, ethan, you're
the last person she should be sending.

52
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,800
There's about to be anothe
terrorist attack on this city.

53
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,860
That's why she wants you to remain here.

54
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:55,080
Are we talking about
more planes going down?

55
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,290
We don't know. But whatever's
going to happen will happen soon.

56
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,940
I'm heading to the pentagon.

57
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:04,880
On top of all of this, there's
also the invasion to deal with.

58
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:10,910
So, bear in mind, your mother's
under tremendous pressure right now.

59
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:17,570
It's only a matter of time before the media
picks up on the heightened security measures.

60
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:19,970
I want to issue a statement
before that happens.

61
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:22,030
Play down the actual
likelihood of an attack,

62
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,600
talk about the security measures as
being due diligence, rather than...

63
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,970
no, meredith. The public
deserves the truth.

64
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:32,330
We stress caution and calm, but we acknowledge
we have intel about another terrorist action.

65
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:35,600
Yes, ma'am. Angela and i will have
something for you as soon as possible.

66
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,010
madam president, larry
moss is calling in.

67
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:42,850
He says he's got a lead on the attack.

68
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,850
Put him throh.

69
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,520
Agent moss, you're
on with the president.

70
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,040
Madam president, we've discovered what we believe
was a staging area being used by terrorists

71
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,510
on the south shore of the potomac,
near the itp rail and shipyards.

72
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:58,490
Madam president, we've identified
one of the men as general juma.

73
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,530
What? Juma's in dc?

74
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:05,480
Yes, ma'am, and we know that there are at
least a dozen other men involved in the attack,

75
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,320
and they are armed for a small war.

76
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,420
Have you found evidence that
tells us where the target might be?

77
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:13,160
No, ma'am, but we have search
teams out looking for the men,

78
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,600
and we're hoping that agent
walker has more information.

79
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:20,580
She's the one who I.D.'D juma, but,
uh, we've lost contact with her.

80
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:21,890
Lost contact?

81
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:24,300
Yes, madam president, but
we have every reason to hope

82
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:28,100
that she's still alive and
in pursuit of the terrorists.

83
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:31,830
If she's out there,
ma'am, we'll find her.

84
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:50,390
Hold it right there!

85
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,030
I'm agent renee walker, fbi.

86
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:54,750
Agent walker, we just
got an alert on you.

87
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,220
You need to call larry
moss at fbi right now.

88
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:58,070
Tell him there's gonna be a
terrorist attack on the white house.

89
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:00,190
Yes, ma'am. I'll call it in right away.

90
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,560
This is thompson...

91
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:18,150
Ranger thompson, please respond and
report your location. Ranger thompson...

92
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,400
Ranger thompson, please respond and
report your location. Ranger thompson...

93
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:29,440
bill.

94
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:33,250
The attorney general wants you transferred to
his custody so he can file criminal charges.

95
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:35,330
Have we learned anything
else about the attack?

96
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:38,890
I reached tony. He couldn't get
any more information from his guy.

97
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:44,130
According to the fbi, renee walker followed a lead
on her own to an abandoned warehouse on the potomac.

98
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:47,920
Got a visual on a heavily-armed
commando unit led by juma himself.

99
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:49,560
But she went missing right
after she called it in.

100
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,620
- What do you mean, missing?
- We're not sure.

101
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:53,950
The fbi's searching the area,
but there's no sign of her,

102
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:56,020
or any evidence telling us
what the target might be.

103
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,770
Burnett knows.

104
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:58,980
The president offered
him an immunity deal.

105
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:00,410
He turned it down,
hasn't said a word since.

106
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:02,770
Damn it, bill, he was
talking when they stopped me.

107
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:05,810
Put me in a room with him for five minutes,
and we can stop this thing from happening.

108
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:09,760
Jack, even if I was willing to release you,
he's being transported to kennedy memorial.

109
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:10,860
You couldn't get access to him.

110
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:13,490
Fine. Then you do it.
You can get access.

111
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,600
I'm not trained in coercive techniques.

112
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:19,400
This is not a maybe. Ryan burnett is
an accessory to a terrorist attack.

113
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:21,090
If you don't do this, people will die.

114
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,460
Look, I'm not arguing about what
needs to be done. But I can't do it.

115
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:24,590
I don't do that. It's not me.

116
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,930
- That's not good enough.
- Jack!

117
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,740
Damn it, bill. That's not good enough.

118
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,780
You were the one who told
me, people who stand by--

119
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:32,790
they might as well help
them plant the bomb.

120
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:38,530
You can do this. Bill,
you have to do this.

121
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,280
I can't, jack. I'm sorry.

122
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,080
Bill?

123
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:56,820
I can'T.

124
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:21,510
This is it, general.

125
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:32,150
we're on the other side of the conduit.

126
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:34,330
Are you in position?

127
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,020
Yes, general. I'll be ready for you.

128
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:42,290
What was that?

129
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:44,470
I thought I heard you say something.

130
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:47,740
- Just, uh, talking to myself.
- yeah.

131
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:50,230
Hey, I tell you we're having
people over on saturday?

132
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:52,460
Nothing fancy. We're
bringing in chinese.

133
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:54,830
You think you're gonna
make it this time?

134
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:00,850
Chinese. But I was looking
forward to sheila's cooking.

135
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,560
all clear, general.

136
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:28,860
Excellent.

137
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,490
we'll have access in ten seconds.

138
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:50,120
Once we're in, we'll have two minutes
until e proximity alarms come back up.

139
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:56,060
Five, four, three, two, one...

140
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,430
move!

141
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:41,010
I've accessed the secret
service tracking grid.

142
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,340
Where is she?

143
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:48,160
Right here in the oval office.

144
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:51,640
Let's go.

145
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:20,540
clear.

146
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:33,800
We will meet resistance,
which we must counter quickly.

147
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:35,980
Silently.

148
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,940
We have nine minutes until the
next secret service roll call.

149
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:42,970
We must find the president by then.

150
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:09,990
The president is preparing to issue
a statement that will clarify that.

151
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:13,060
Yeah, I'll let you know, soon
as it's ready for release.

152
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:16,600
Let go of the phone.

153
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:22,420
five minutes until roll call, general.

154
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,940
juma had your father killed.

155
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:58,020
What?

156
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:00,560
Listen to me, I know that
dubaku is your father.

157
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,900
Juma's been lying to
you. Your father is dead.

158
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:04,360
My father is alive!

159
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:06,820
Juma had to make sure that
your father didn't talk.

160
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:09,840
So he sent a man named
udo to murder him.

161
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,650
No. No, I... I don't believe you.

162
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:15,660
Look, I was there when udo
did it. That's how I found you.

163
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,970
By following him back to the rail car.

164
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,680
General juma betrayed you.

165
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:24,300
You are lying. You are lying!

166
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:56,540
renee!

167
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:59,480
I know the target.

168
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,480
Reissued warrants and
order for transport, sir.

169
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:09,950
Sorry, jack.

170
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:16,230
this way, mr. Bauer.

171
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,970
- Bill buchanan.
- It's larry moss.

172
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:21,740
Renee walker says the
target is the white house.

173
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,450
- How good is her intel?
- Firsthand.

174
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:26,110
She says they're getting
in via subterranean access.

175
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:28,850
I'll initiate a
lockdown. You alert cirg.

176
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,960
This is bill buchanan.

177
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:33,910
I have confirmation the white house
is a target of a terrorist attack.

178
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:36,810
Condition red. Repeat: Condition
red. Secure the president.

179
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:39,320
Get to your posts.

180
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:42,250
Jack, I could use your help.

181
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,290
I need to know you'll
do exactly as I say.

182
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:46,870
You have my word.

183
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:50,550
- Where's the president now?
- Oval office.

184
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,410
What's the meaning of this?

185
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:56,610
- You need to come with us.
- The white house is under attack. What?

186
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:59,120
Madam president, we need to go.

187
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:04,050
Ma'am, we need to go
right now. Ms.Taylor.

188
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:07,890
I've got the president's daughter.
We're on our way to the lockdown.

189
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:09,870
Men are down. There's no safe path out.

190
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,260
We need to secure her in
the first floor lockdown.

191
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,060
Bill, we're clear.

192
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,570
What the hell is he doing here?

193
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:15,280
He's with me.

194
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:17,700
Madam president, right now, you
need all the help you can get.

195
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:19,450
How is this happening?
Where's my daughter?

196
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:22,960
Aaron pierce is taking her to lockdown
as we speak, but we need to move.

197
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:26,360
Agents in zones five, seven
and nine, please respond.

198
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:29,250
Five, seven and nine, respond.

199
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:30,920
I can't reach anyone in the quadrant.

200
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:33,210
Juma's men are headed straight for us.

201
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:36,200
They know where she is.
They're tracking her, bill.

202
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:39,330
Madam president, let
me see your tracker.

203
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,380
Bill, what's the most direct route
to the lockdown? From the east.

204
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:46,070
I'll head west with the tracker and
draw them away. You go with jack.

205
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:49,150
Agent bauer.

206
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:51,850
This is your house. I'll follow.

207
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,520
We're moving the president to lockdown.

208
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:59,640
Agent hovis, we've got agents
down in multiple quadrants.

209
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:01,110
We need reinforcements, sir.

210
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:04,150
Copy that. We're on our
way to the lockdown now.

211
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,570
Let's go.

212
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,400
General. The president
has left the oval office.

213
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:18,220
She's heading down the west corridor.

214
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:22,270
Udo, take your team that way.
We'll trap her in between us.

215
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:54,130
We're getting close
to the president, sir.

216
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:57,060
Up ahead, around this corner.

217
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:07,720
The president's tracker, sir.

218
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,790
they know we're here.

219
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,850
They're moving the
president to the lockdown.

220
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:15,670
Find her.

221
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:30,730
Take him. We need hostages. Start
gathering 'em up. Let's move.

222
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:49,390
We've engaged hostiles on
the way to the lockdown.

223
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:53,030
We do not have a visual on the
president. We're still two minutes away.

224
00:17:55,370 --> 00:18:01,650
get up! Get up! Get up! Get up! move
it! Come on! Come on, move it! Come on!

225
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:05,810
Aaron, it's jack. I'm with the president,
approaching lockdown. Where are you?

226
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:08,700
We're still upstairs, jack.

227
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:11,790
Move! Move!

228
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,950
hostiles are in control of the area.

229
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:15,950
Looking for a way past
them to the lockdown.

230
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,130
Copy that. Juma's men are
closing on our position.

231
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:21,140
You're going to have about 30 seconds to
get here before I have to seal this door.

232
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:22,300
Understood.

233
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:24,750
You will not close this door
until my daughter gets here.

234
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:27,130
Madam president, right now, your life is
the priority, whether you like it or not.

235
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:30,370
Please, step inside.

236
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:47,650
madam president, are you all right?

237
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:51,870
Aaron, it's jack. We're sealed off in the lockdown.
We came under attack. We didn't have a choice.

238
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:55,540
We couldn't have made it anyway, jack.
We'll try to find a way out of the building.

239
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:57,860
- Copy that, aaron...
- jack.

240
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,970
Jack, do you read me?

241
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:05,910
Aaron, it's jack. Do you copy? Damn it.

242
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,100
Juma's cut off our communication.

243
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,780
I need to know that my daughter's safe.

244
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:12,710
Madam president, I
can't answer that yet.

245
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,280
Abo.

246
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:49,050
General juma, they
brought in reinforcements.

247
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:52,360
I don't know how much longer we can
hold them off from your position.

248
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:54,640
Stand by.

249
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:57,860
Ngozi?

250
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:03,190
Agents are moving in from all directions;
we will be heavily outnumbered.

251
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:07,870
Does secret service know the
president is secured in the lockdown?

252
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,500
The only ones who saw are dead.

253
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:12,960
Put me on to their
communications channel.

254
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:15,320
Go ahead, sir.

255
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:18,480
This is general juma.
I have the president.

256
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:22,040
Evacuate immediately, or she will die.

257
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:28,130
I need proof you have the president
before I can give that order.

258
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:30,220
- Let us speak to her.
- Who is this?

259
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,790
Special agent hovis.

260
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:36,220
Agent hovis, move your men out of the
building and beyond the fence line,

261
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:38,540
or I will kill the president.

262
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:41,530
And her death will be on your head.

263
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:45,680
Agent hovis?

264
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:46,930
We're pulling back.

265
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,620
All agents, fall back immediately!

266
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:53,530
I repeat: All agents fall back.

267
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:07,270
General, secret service is retreating.

268
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:13,160
They are retreating, general.

269
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:15,390
- All of them?
- Yes, sir.

270
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:20,550
Gather all the hostages
and bring them here.

271
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,780
- Lock down the exits. Move.
- Sir.

272
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:39,950
Confirming secret service
retreat in western quadrant.

273
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:42,660
Copy, general.

274
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:47,830
The only reason secret service would retreat
is if they thought juma had the president.

275
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:50,800
But that man, bauer, said he
got my mother into the lockdown.

276
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:52,750
Juma's bluffing them.

277
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,400
We need to get out of here and let our
people know that as soon as possible

278
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:56,590
so they can retake the building.

279
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:58,870
Get out of here? How?
They're everywhere.

280
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:03,320
Move it!

281
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:07,580
Keep your hands on your
head-- move it! Go! Move it!

282
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:16,540
Move it! Move!

283
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:24,980
Move it! Come on, move! Move it! Move
your feet. Get out here. Move it. Move it.

284
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:28,380
Right here. Keep
going. Come on. Move it!

285
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,290
Turn around. Turn around.

286
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,470
Can you open it?

287
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,590
Yes. Assuming the specifications
hodges gave us are correct.

288
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,180
- How long?
- 15 minutes.

289
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:30,980
We confronted them in one
of the first floor corridors.

290
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:36,220
At tt point, juma ordered us to retreat, threatening
to kill the president if we didn't comply.

291
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:39,200
But he never gave a visual
confirmation he was holding the esident?

292
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:42,220
No, he didn't, but I felt, at that
point, I had no choice but to pull back.

293
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,980
His men were killing
civilians and agents.

294
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:45,830
Any idea how many people
are still trapped inside?

295
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:48,400
Cross-checking the evacuees
with the white house manifest.

296
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:51,130
So far, it looks like 53.

297
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:52,150
Any secret service?

298
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:55,630
As far as I know, we have no
agents left in there still alive.

299
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,070
*********

300
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,120
They'll be prepared to storm the
building as soon as the order is given.

301
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:05,310
Yeah, well, at this point, that order
has to be given by the vice president.

302
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,310
What's his status?

303
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:09,140
Secret service has him en
route to a secure location.

304
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:12,130
All right, let me know as
soon as he's locked down.

305
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,770
And hovis, I need an infrared
sat-an of the building.

306
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:17,360
- Highest resolution possible.
- Got it.

307
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:26,240
You didn't tell me that
jack was in the white house.

308
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:29,380
He was under arrest. Being he under
guard when the attack took place.

309
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:31,920
Under arrest for what?

310
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:37,220
He found out an aide to senator mayer
named burnett was part of the conspiracy.

311
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:41,720
He was caught torturing
him... in the white house.

312
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:45,540
Almost killed the man
before he was stopped.

313
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:51,870
Renee, the president is our
priority, not jack bauer.

314
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:52,910
- Are we clear on that?
- Clear.

315
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:55,080
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

316
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:06,860
They're bringing in more hostages.

317
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:13,530
Get down! Now! Get in
here! Sit! No talking.

318
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:17,780
I don't see olivia.

319
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:19,860
Madam president, that's gd news.

320
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:24,170
I know aaron pierce. He will do everything in
his power to make sure that your daughter is safe.

321
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:26,610
This is the white house, for god's sake.

322
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:29,360
How is it possible that they were able
to get around our security protocols?

323
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,180
There's only one explanation.

324
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:33,000
They had help on the inside.

325
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:35,610
From whom?

326
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:42,890
Oh, this is insane.

327
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:46,220
Juma must realize that there's no
way for him to get out of this alive.

328
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:48,680
I'm afraid he does. This is his endgame.

329
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:51,460
He came here to make a statement,
and he's willing to die for it.

330
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:54,380
As soon as the rescue teams realize
that you're secure, they'll move in.

331
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:56,860
It's only a matter of time.

332
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:59,750
What's he doing? Is that
some kind of explosive?

333
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,310
- No.
- mr. Bauer?

334
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:06,400
Oh, my god. They've
got the access codes.

335
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:08,140
I need to get into that panel.

336
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:09,430
Is there something I can do?

337
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:12,720
Yeah, give me that toolbox
over there. Put it on the table.

338
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:32,870
Damn it.

339
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:42,010
Madam president, plug the cord
into the wall, please. Now.

340
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,990
Okay.

341
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:01,500
General.

342
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:07,260
- What's wrong?
- It just went dead.

343
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:10,530
Somehow, they must have disabled
the circuitry from inside.

344
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:13,890
Then, we'll use c4
to blow open the door.

345
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:17,990
We'll have to drill sinkholes into each of
the 11 locking rods. It will take too long.

346
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,880
Depending on how the steel is
hardened, c4 might not even work.

347
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:26,140
Then we'll find another way.

348
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,950
There can be no room for doubt.

349
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:45,310
We have the president trapped.

350
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:49,220
We open up that door, we
become a part of history.

351
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:52,700
We will find another way.

352
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:17,970
yes. just a moment.

353
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:23,220
Call came in on the dedicated uplink.

354
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:26,140
- I heard it.
- It's him, sir.

355
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,930
Put him on speaker.

356
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:39,750
General, didn't expect to
be hearing from you directly.

357
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:41,140
What is it I can do for you?

358
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:42,970
We have a problem.

359
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:45,760
The president is
secured in the lockdown.

360
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,550
Well, we prepared you
for that possibility.

361
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:50,220
We gave you the specs
for the locking mechanism.

362
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:53,170
Theyhorted the lock out from the inside.

363
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:55,710
I need you to find me another way in.

364
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:58,050
General, I've given you
everything I have to give.

365
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:00,430
My part in this thing is over.

366
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:11,070
Are you forgetting that you
don't have the shipment yet?

367
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:15,160
Now, general, I expect you to be
an honorable man. We made a deal.

368
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:18,020
We held up our end of the bargain.
We got you in the white house.

369
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:19,800
I expect you to hold up yours.

370
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,350
I don't care about your expectations.

371
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:26,750
You help me, or I will destroy that
shipment before it ever arrives to you.

372
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:30,620
Hang on.

373
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:34,890
Well... seaton, what do you think?

374
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,450
Can he do what he says?

375
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:39,080
The shipment's not due in the
port for another two hours.

376
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:43,300
His men will have plenty of time
to destroy it, render it useless.

377
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:55,980
General? Tell me-- who else is in
the lockdown with the president?

378
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:59,440
My men saw her enter with another man.

379
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:03,980
Well, I'm looking at the white house
manifest, and according to this,

380
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:08,300
olivia taylo is presently
in the building with you.

381
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:12,190
The president's daughter? Are you sure?

382
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,480
Their system logs everyone
in and out electronically.

383
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,420
If it says that she's
in there, she's in there.

384
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:21,380
Now, you find olivia taylor, and you'll
get the president to open that door.

385
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:24,900
Your shipment will arrive as planned.

386
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:27,350
Thank you.

387
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:33,550
There, you see--
stress. Stress...

388
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:37,050
is the fertilizer of creativity.

389
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:40,920
Let's play some darts.

390
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:43,830
The president's daughter is
somewhere in the white house.

391
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:46,580
Let's find her.

392
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:57,280
Raise your heads. Show me your faces.

393
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:15,190
What do you think's going on?

394
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:19,420
I asked you a question, mr. Buchanan.

395
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:24,460
You think I made the
wrong call with bauer.

396
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:30,030
You think that if I'd signed off on him torturing
ryan burnett, all of this could have been avoided?

397
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:36,220
You don't know what
I'm thinking, senator.

398
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:44,900
She's not here.

399
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:49,240
Go ahead and find her
and bring her to me.

400
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:15,290
- What happened? What did you see?
- The door's guarded.

401
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,020
Well, there's got to be another way out.

402
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:19,700
There are only three exits to
this wing, and they're all covered.

403
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:22,140
The windows are sealed
and hardened. Unbreakable.

404
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:24,820
We have to let them know the terrorists are
bluffing; that they don't have my mother.

405
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:27,630
Our only option is to get a signal out.

406
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,210
We can do it from the
windows of the residence.

407
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:30,370
Okay, okay, good.

408
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:33,210
You'll be safer if I
leave you in a secure area.

409
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:35,020
I'll get the signal out
and come back for you.

410
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:37,630
I'm not gonna sit and hide in
some damn vent, agent pierce.

411
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:43,030
Ma'am, it is a long way, and we're probably gonna
encounter more of juma's men. It's too dangerous.

412
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:48,350
I don't care. I'm going with you, and
don't try to argue. On't have the time.

413
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:53,610
Okay. Stay behind me.

414
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:09,840
Agent moss, sat-scan's all set up here.

415
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:14,500
We can see the cluster of hostages,
but not the individual bodies.

416
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:16,310
That the best they can do? They
can't boost the resolution on this?

417
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:20,370
No, sir. The white house is one of the most
heavily shielded buildings in the world.

418
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:22,320
Yeah, got it.

419
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:24,710
The vice president's ready.
They're initiating communication.

420
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,090
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

421
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,910
Give us the room.

422
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,440
You're on with the vice president.

423
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:46,090
Mr. Vice president, I'm special agent
moss, head of the fbi's dc branch.

424
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:48,210
This is agent walker.

425
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:50,330
I've been briefed on
the general situation.

426
00:33:50,370 --> 00:33:51,960
What are the latest facts on the ground?

427
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:53,490
There's nothing further
from general juma,

428
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:58,390
but an infrared scan of the building shows he's holding
the hostages in a hallway outside the roosevelt room.

429
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:01,920
Now this is very possibly
good news for the president.

430
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:02,920
Explain.

431
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:05,640
The area's not one of the more
defensible places in the building.

432
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:08,900
Tactically, it makes no sense for
juma to have chosen it as a base.

433
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:11,970
However, the area is adjacent
to the ground floor lockdown,

434
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:14,890
which we know the
president was en route to.

435
00:34:14,930 --> 00:34:17,640
So, you think the president
made it into the lockdown?

436
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:19,770
That's our best explanation
for him being there.

437
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:22,170
We're therefore are asking you
to authorize the rescue operation

438
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:25,310
before juma manages to
penetrate the lockdown.

439
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:35,140
Do you have any other evidence that supports
your theory that the president is in the lockdown?

440
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:40,640
There's the fact that he couldn't produce the
president when we asked him to prove that he had her.

441
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:41,830
Couldn't or wouldn't?

442
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,480
You can't be certain
which one it is, can you?

443
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:45,250
Certainty's not possible
in this case, sir.

444
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:49,650
We're giving you our best estimation
and we urge you to allow us to launch.

445
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:53,380
What if you're wrong? What if
juma does have the president?

446
00:34:53,390 --> 00:34:56,200
He will kill her as soon as
he realizes what you're doing.

447
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:58,570
Inaction has its own risks, too, sir.

448
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:01,000
The more time juma has
to reinforce his position,

449
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:04,590
the more difficult it'll be to
take the building and to save lives.

450
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,090
I understand.

451
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:08,310
But my priority must
be the president's life.

452
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:11,990
Prudence dictates that I hold off
on authorizing the rescue operation

453
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:14,380
until we can be more
certain of her status.

454
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:18,090
Mr. Vice president, terrorists
are in control of the white house.

455
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:23,040
I would ask you to consider if prudence is
the appropriate response in this situation.

456
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:26,830
I thank you for your
thoughts, agent walker.

457
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:31,400
Until you can provide me with more
intel on what's going on in there,

458
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:36,010
you are instructed to refrain
from launching any action.

459
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:39,200
Keep me apprised of any
further developments.

460
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:43,990
All he's interested in
is covering his own ass.

461
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:45,790
He's the vice president.

462
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:48,740
Right now, he's calling the shots.

463
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:51,490
It was the right call, sir.

464
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:55,490
You can't order an operation that results in the
president's death and your own elevation to the job.

465
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,220
It would be politically untenable.

466
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:01,620
Never let anyone hear you
talking like that, derek.

467
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:05,390
- Understood?
- Yes, sir.

468
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,030
oh, my god, aaron!

469
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:32,690
They would've heard those shots,

470
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:35,530
so you're going to need to get the
signal out before they get back.

471
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:39,330
There's a security kit behind
that door in the bureau.

472
00:36:39,370 --> 00:36:41,840
It's got first aid and a flashlight.

473
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:43,920
You'll flash morse code out the window.

474
00:36:43,970 --> 00:36:47,010
Reach in my jacket. I got a pen. Here.

475
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:51,840
Give it to me. give me your hand.

476
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:59,060
this is called "code green." A dot is
a short blink; a dash is a long one.

477
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:03,430
"Code green" will signal
them to move in. Go!

478
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:36,920
general juma, I have
the president's daughter.

479
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:44,470
Bring him.

480
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:10,360
Sources have confirmed that the siege inside the
white house began approximately 40 minutes ago.

481
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,690
We do not yet have confirmation on
the number of hostages being held,

482
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:15,750
or if the president is among them.

483
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:20,020
Behind me, you can see dozen of
tactical assault units standing by.

484
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:24,470
Government analysts tell us the order to
launch any operation in these circumstances

485
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,950
would rest with the vice president.

486
00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:32,750
General, I discovered fiber-optic
cameras embedded in the chandelier.

487
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:58,670
- Get me a chair.
- Yes, general.

488
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:15,390
He spotted the cameras.

489
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:19,890
Give me a secure channel.

490
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:22,520
Go ahead, sir.

491
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:27,520
President taylor, I see now
that you've been watching us.

492
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:31,910
Good. There is something
I think you should see.

493
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:42,460
god, no.

494
00:39:44,970 --> 00:39:48,010
If you don't open the door,

495
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:53,480
I'm going to cut out your
daughter's eyes one by one.

496
00:39:53,890 --> 00:39:58,530
And then I'm going to
cut out her tongue...

497
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:02,930
- and then her head.
- Mom, don't listen!

498
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:04,780
I know what you're thinking.

499
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:08,350
How do you know if you open
the door that I won't kill her?

500
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:13,370
All you need to know is that I most
certainly will kill her if you don'T.

501
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,110
- open the door.
- Madam president,

502
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:24,040
- No.Open the door.Open the door!
- I can't! I can't!

503
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:27,870
That is my daughter out
there. Do you understand?

504
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:30,230
I've already lost my son.

505
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:33,240
Have you any idea what
it's like to lose a child?

506
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:36,760
Madam president, I am genuinely
sorry, but I cannot let them take you.

507
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,620
There is nothing you can do for her now.

508
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:43,220
Do you have children, jack?

509
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:47,220
I have a daughter.

510
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:49,060
Could you do what
you're asking me to do?

511
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:51,690
Ju stand by and watch her butchered?

512
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:56,550
No, ma'am. But I am not the
president of the united states.

513
00:40:56,810 --> 00:40:58,900
Well, i am the president.

514
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:02,690
And I am ordering you to open that door.

515
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:24,430
You're running out of time.

516
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,880
mom...

517
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:33,370
perhaps this will make your
mother decide more quickly.

518
00:41:57,660 --> 00:41:59,970
mom, you shouldn't have...

519
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:03,340
I wouldn't let them hurt you, darling.

520
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:11,090
Damn it, bauer. What have you done?

521
00:42:18,430 --> 00:42:21,510
all right, general, you've got me now.

522
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:24,940
There's no reason to hold anyone else.

523
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:27,430
Let them go.

524
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:38,910
You... don't give orders to me.

525
00:42:40,330 --> 00:42:43,470
Get the camera ready for her statement.

526
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:46,120
What statement?

527
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:49,840
The last one you'll ever give.
