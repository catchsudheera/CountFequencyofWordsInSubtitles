00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,310
Previously on 24

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,570
Tanner. Emerson spoke to
his man inside the bureau.

4
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,500
- He says you're clear.
- Good.

5
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:19,490
Look, I need to prep my men on the next
job, so why don't you tell me what we need.

6
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:22,040
I'll give you the specs when I get there.

7
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:24,050
I'll engage him. Cover my flank.

8
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:27,080
I can handle it.

9
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:32,960
I don't understand. Almeida
was orchestrating these attacks.

10
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:35,660
If he doesn't have the cip device, who does?

11
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:37,960
Almeida's working for the juma regime.

12
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:40,440
This is colonel ike dubaku.

13
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:46,240
We demand an immediate withdraw of the
U. S. Naval strike force by this time tomorrow...

14
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,680
the american troops are still
in position near our country.

15
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:52,590
President taylor just received your demands.

16
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,010
The perhaps it is time for a
more forceful demonstration.

17
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:57,750
I know about samantha roth.

18
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,640
She's hiding something about my son's murder.

19
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,020
Roger wasn't murdered.

20
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,940
I wasn't completely honest with you.

21
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:04,940
What do you mean?

22
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:07,870
Roger didn't commit suicide, mr. Taylor.

23
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,110
He was murdered.

24
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,290
Jack, tony is not a terrort.

25
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:12,190
He's working with me.

26
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:14,080
We're working outside the government.

27
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:17,130
That's why we have to get tony back undercover.

28
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:19,430
Bauer, you're going to make it out of here.

29
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:22,420
Shut up.

30
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:25,230
Get down!

31
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:27,500
we got to get you out of here and back undercover.

32
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:29,320
Go!

33
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,600
tony, let's go!

34
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:52,390

36
00:01:55,400 --> 00:02:00,270
The following takes place between 11am and 12pm

37
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:05,720
renee...

38
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:09,390
security saw bauer and almeida
getting into a dark-colored panel van.

39
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,580
- What direction were they heading?
- West.

40
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:13,220
What's happening with td. O. T. Cameras?

41
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:15,310
I've been trying. Traffic images aren't loading.

42
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,530
What do you mean not loading?

43
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:18,480
Just what I said. The server's not responding.

44
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:20,380
The hacker must be jamming the transmission.

45
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,390
How the hell can they do that?

46
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,150
Well, if I knew, I'd be able to get around it.

47
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:27,640
Continue checking ancillary security cams, atms,
parking garages-- there has to be something.

48
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:29,670
Well, keep canvassing the area.

49
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,680
Someone else may have seen the vehicle. That...

50
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:33,580
fine. Let me know.

51
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:35,810
No luck on municipal cameras.

52
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:37,590
Looks like they have someone
running interference for them.

53
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,810
Damn it.

54
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:41,840
Bauer must have worked out this
escape with almeida's people.

55
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,390
I'm so sorry, larry.

56
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:46,310
That son of a bitch played me. Had me
believing the bureau was compromised--

57
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:47,800
someone on the inside working against us.

58
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:49,320
I realize now it was him all along.

59
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:52,130
Don't put this on yourself. He played us both.

60
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,390
No, I should have seen it.

61
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:54,990
This is fine, take it downstairs.

62
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,630
Bailer's facing a federal
indictment-- years in prison.

63
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,620
Almeida must have offered him a way out.

64
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:02,550
Agent moss... the white house is on line one.

65
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,070
I'll, uh, take it in the
conference room. Thanks, erica.

66
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:08,420
I'm going to make this rig, larry.

67
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:11,050
Whatever it takes, I will find bauer and almeida.

68
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:14,530
Well, throw in a cip device,
and maybe we'll be off the hook.

69
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,080
Janis, what's the status of that shooter?

70
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:17,670
He hasn't regained consciousness yet.

71
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,060
But a print match is just coming up now.

72
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,060
His name is alan tanner.

73
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,860
He was former special forces,
discharged after desert storm.

74
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:28,720
Discharged why?

75
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:29,970
Medical reasons.

76
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:33,000
He made claims to having gulf war syndrome.

77
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:35,870
Tried to sue the government, case was dismissed.

78
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,400
I want to be informed the minute he's awake.

79
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,760
I'm connecting you now.

80
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,560
Agent moss, this is ethan kanin.

81
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:48,730
I'm here with the president.

82
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:51,260
What are you and your folks
doing about the situation?

83
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:53,050
We put out an all-agency alert.

84
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:55,750
Everyone understands apprehending
almeida is our top priority.

85
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,030
How did he escape?

86
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:02,140
He had the help of a former ctu
agent that we mistakenly trusted.

87
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:03,870
A man by the name of jack bauer.

88
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,350
Bauer?

89
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,910
I thought he was in the middle
of a senate investigative hearing.

90
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,120
Yes, sir, that is correct.

91
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:12,020
We issued a subpoena a few hours
ago, excusing him from the hearings

92
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:15,040
in order to enlist his help
in apprehending almeida.

93
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:17,400
Now you're saying that these two men are allied?

94
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,650
It would appear so.

95
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:20,200
My god...

96
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:23,710
you and your people have
royally screwed up, agent moss!

97
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:28,650
Without almeida, we have no way of finding
dubaku and no chance of recovering the cip device.

98
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:30,400
Ethan, let's stay on point.

99
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:32,960
Agent moss, are you working any other leads?

100
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:34,090
Yes, madame president.

101
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:37,000
A confederate of almeida's
who was wounded earlier today.

102
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,180
He's just out of surgery.

103
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,830
We're waiting for him to regain consciousness.

104
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,720
Do we have a time frame from the
hospital on when that might happen?

105
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:45,340
No, ma'am. Not really.

106
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:49,940
Let me be clear, Recapturing almeida
and bauer isn't just your top iority,

107
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:51,500
it's your only priority.

108
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:52,750
Yes, ma'am.

109
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:55,270
Keep us posted, agent.

110
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:59,290
Bottom line: The bureau is not going
to be the answer to our prayers here.

111
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,130
I'm afraid not.

112
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:03,190
How much time does that leave us?

113
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,260
Less than two hours.

114
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:10,420
Dubaku's demand is that our forces retreat
behind the 23rd meridian within 24 hours.

115
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:12,300
Now, in order to meet that timetable,

116
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:17,130
the fleet and carrier air wing must
start withdrawing by 1:00, at the latest.

117
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:19,580
Which would effectively end our mission in africa

118
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:23,530
and condemn another 100,000 sangalans
to a certain and brutal death.

119
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:27,510
On the other hand, if you authorize the invasion,

120
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:31,610
dubaku will undoubtedly engage the cip device.

121
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:37,690
How far has the faa gotten
with grounding aircraft?

122
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:41,360
Still over a thousand planes in the air across
the country waiting for clearance to land.

123
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:45,330
Dubaku could bring down any
one of them at any moment.

124
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:50,170
Or... use the device for something far worse.

125
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:55,010
I ran for office on the principle
of non-negotiation with terrorists.

126
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:58,550
How can I abandon that now,
the very first time I'm tested?

127
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:02,130
And, if I do so, won't I be telling
dubaku, and the rest of the world,

128
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,230
that blackmailing america works?

129
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:07,870
Madame president, those are
questions for the future.

130
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:11,010
We have a decision to make now.

131
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,500
What do you call this place?

132
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,740
We like to think of it as ctu.

133
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,860
What's left of it, anyway.

134
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:36,730
Jack...

135
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,400
chloe.

136
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:40,720
It's good to see you.

137
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:43,330
It's good to see you, too.

138
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:45,160
I'm glad you're with us.

139
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:48,520
I'm not with anyone until someone
starts answering some questions.

140
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:50,220
Might as well start with you.

141
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,780
Why the hell are you not dead?

142
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:54,880
I was dead, jack.

143
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,190
For almost ten minutes.

144
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:58,620
Or so I was told.

145
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:01,000
- By who?
- By him.

146
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:06,800
His name's david emerson.

147
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:08,560
I don't know who he paid off at ctu,

148
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:11,740
but it was his people who injected
my body with a hypothermic compound,

149
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:13,290
and was able to revive me.

150
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:14,670
Who is he and what does he want?

151
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,190
Independent contractor.

152
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,820
Enlists ex-military and intelligence
operatives, jobs them out to clients.

153
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,640
Apparently, I fit the profile.

154
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:22,820
What profile?

155
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:26,580
Former employees with grievances
against the federal government.

156
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,920
Emerson had been keeping tabs
on me ever since I left ctu.

157
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:33,810
After michelle was killed...

158
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,140
he figured I'd make a good recruit.

159
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,590
And everyone else thinking
you're dead, so much the better.

160
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:40,780
Yeah.

161
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:44,480
And since then, you've been working
undercover to expose his operation?

162
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:52,230
- No, jack.
- What?

163
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:56,090
I was really working for him.

164
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,860
I was angry.

165
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:04,170
I hated the federal government
for what it took from me.

166
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,870
I ran emerson's crew for more than three years.

167
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,400
And I did some pretty bad things.

168
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,750
What made you turn against him?

169
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,340
The cip device.

170
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:28,810
Emerson had my crew stealing
components to breach the firewall.

171
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:33,020
I knew what that meant:
Innocent americans would die.

172
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,250
And I didn't signed up for that.

173
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,080
Damn it, tony! Why didn't
you call the authorities?

174
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:38,070
- He couldn't, jack.
- Why not?

175
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,970
He found out emerson's client was dubaku.

176
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:46,200
That's who you believe has
agents inside the government.

177
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:49,600
The juma regime controls
sangala's vast diamond wealth.

178
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,690
Dubaku hasn't been shy about throwing it around.

179
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:53,180
How widespread is the corruption?

180
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,920
Pervasive. That's why tony came to me.

181
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:58,260
He didn't know how far or high up this thing went.

182
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,410
Dubaku is the key to this thing, jack.

183
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:02,340
If we're going to uncover the conspiracy,

184
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:04,780
we have to get to him before he leaves the U. S.

185
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:07,920
That's why I have to get
back under soon as possible.

186
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:10,240
There's a new job in the
pipeline for me and my crew--

187
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:11,260
I don't have all the details,

188
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:14,420
but I do know that it'll get me
in the sa room with dubkau himself.

189
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,610
The challenge is going to be
reinstalling tony with emerson.

190
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,870
We have to assume emerson knew tony was in
fbi custody and somehow managed to escape.

191
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:25,020
Emerson's going to think tony
made a deal with the U. S. Attorney.

192
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:27,080
That's right.

193
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:38,450
I can help you with this.

194
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:40,720
Yes, you can.

195
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,770
Outside of the three of you, who
else is involved in this operatn?

196
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:49,430
It's just us. This is it.

197
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:58,720
Please, at least tell me that you've got
some proof that this conspiracy exists.

198
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:01,090
Yes, we do. But only at the lowest level.

199
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,380
At this point, we've just
begun to scratch the surface.

200
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,830
Okay.

201
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,250
I'll work with you.

202
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:21,410
But only because, right w, you
are the only people that I trust.

203
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:26,450
You give me one reason to question
that, and I swear I will turn you in.

204
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,290
You understand?

205
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:32,670
All right. Chloe, set up the call with emerson.

206
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:36,510
I found two freelancers who might work. Angers.

207
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:40,090
- You trust them?
- Yeah. I've worked with them before. They're close.

208
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,140
- Litvak knows them, too.
- Okay.

209
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:44,700
They may want to know more about
the job before they sign on.

210
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:47,200
Only thing they need to know is what it pays.

211
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,640
all right.

212
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,050
- Yeah?
- It's me.

213
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:57,730
Tony.

214
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:00,920
Where are you?

215
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:02,670
I'm at a parking garage, getting a car.

216
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,250
I got away from the fbi.

217
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:05,570
Yeah, I heard.

218
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:08,370
I also heard it was jack bauer who broke you out.

219
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,260
That's right.

220
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,900
That doesn't make any sense, tony.

221
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:13,220
Uer's working for them. He helped capture you.

222
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:14,870
It's only because he didn't have a choice.

223
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:16,840
He's on board now.

224
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:18,280
What do you mean "on board"?

225
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:20,100
You heard about the senate hearings this morning?

226
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:22,270
They're going to file
criminal charges against him.

227
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,360
I told bauer that if he
helped us out with the mission,

228
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:26,220
you could get him out of the country.

229
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,450
Look, david, if it weren't for
jack, I'd still be in custody.

230
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,810
We can use him, I'm telling you.

231
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,570
I don't know, tony.

232
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,450
Morgan's hiring new men now.

233
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:36,940
Morgan's a thug.

234
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,600
He can't run point on something this important.

235
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:40,210
Let me do it like we planned.

236
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:42,970
Bauer can take tanner's
place and we're good to go.

237
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,930
All right, bring bauer.
We're at 2211 chesterfield.

238
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,250
- Right off nolan.
- Got it.

239
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,800
He buy it?

240
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:55,030
We'll see.

241
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,530
mr. Taylor, I understand you were looking for me.

242
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:38,310
Yes, agent gedge, I have to go out and
I'm going to need some transpoation.

243
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,100
Certainly. Where will we be going?

244
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:42,160
I'll direct you on the way.

245
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:44,360
I need a destination for the manifest, sir.

246
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:47,850
As before, I'd like you to
keep this off the manifest.

247
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:50,680
And no driver this time, just you and me.

248
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:53,600
I thought we were through with
all the subterfuge, mr. Taylor.

249
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:55,880
Please just do as I ask.

250
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:58,950
I'm sorry, sir, not without an explanation.

251
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:04,650
It's samantha roth.

252
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:07,830
She says she has new information
regarding my son's death.

253
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:08,570
Mr. Taylor...

254
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,420
I thought I was done with this, too, believe me.

255
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:13,200
I didn't initiate this. She called me.

256
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,930
Brian...

257
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:22,260
I know you felt obligated to report
my prior activities-- and rightly so--

258
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:27,870
but i would still like to think that I can
count on your loyalty when I ask for it.

259
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:33,830
I could lose my job, sir.

260
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:38,200
This will be the last time. I promise.

261
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:40,170
Henry?

262
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,870
Please.

263
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,740
- I'll call you as soon as I secure a vehicle.
- Thank you.

264
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:50,920
Who was that?

265
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,510
Staff, nothing.

266
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:55,200
- Here, can you help me with this?
- Sure.

267
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,330
It was a gift from my father. You remember?

268
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:01,670
On the day I won back his seat in the nate.

269
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:05,170
Prime minister matobo has asked to see me.

270
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:08,980
He's going to want to know why I
haven't authorized the invasion yet.

271
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:11,270
What are you going to tell him?

272
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,990
I don't know.

273
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:19,090
The american people elected you because
they trust your judgment, allison,

274
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,770
and they're going to trust you to
make the right call on this, too.

275
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:26,590
I don't know what the right call is.

276
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,660
The right call...

277
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:31,520
is whatever you decide it is.

278
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,100
How many units in the field?

279
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,040
17-- all availab
agents are deployed.

280
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:41,170
Widen the grid-- we have to assume bauer and
almeida have gotten outside of our perimeter by now.

281
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,630
On it.

282
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:46,170
sean hillinger.

283
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:47,440
Sean, its me.

284
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:49,070
Christina. Where are you?

285
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,490
I'm calling from the plane.

286
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,690
You haven't landed yet?

287
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:55,890
No, th-the pilot says we're
in a holding pattern...

288
00:14:55,900 --> 00:15:00,010
but we just keep circling and circling, and
I can see other planes out the window, too--

289
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:02,690
eight or nine, at least.

290
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:04,390
Christina, sweetheart, relax.

291
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:08,540
But the woman sitting next to me says
she heard something about a near miss

292
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:11,710
and a problem with the air traffic control system.

293
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:15,000
Sean, do you know anything about this?

294
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:16,550
Yeah, it's true.

295
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:20,310
The faa has grounded some planes,
but it's only a precaution.

296
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:25,660
- Really?
- Yeah, it was an isolated incident. You're going to be fine.

297
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:29,100
Okay. I just...

298
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:31,970
I got worried there for a
minute. You know how I am.

299
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:36,080
I do. Now, listen, I want you
to call me as soon as you land.

300
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:37,650
I will.

301
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:39,590
I love you.

302
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:41,120
I love you, too.

303
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:46,330
Was that your wife?

304
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,520
Janis told me her plane's still in the air.

305
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:52,040
You okay?

306
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:55,900
Okay, there's a maniac out there with the
capability of bringing down planes at will,

307
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,770
so, no, erika, I'm not okay.

308
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:01,500
Her flight is number 18 in the
queue, so it'll be another two hours,

309
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:04,730
at least, before hers gets clearan.

310
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:06,820
I'm sorry.

311
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:08,800
Is there anything I can do?

312
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:10,710
No.

313
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:14,580
No, there's nothing anybody
can do; that's the problem.

314
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:21,080
Yeah, she's right here. I'll
let her know. Thank you, bye-bye.

315
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:22,630
Renee.

316
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,710
I just got off the phone with the hospital.

317
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,220
Tanner's regained consciousness.

318
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:27,120
Is he well enough to talk?

319
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:29,630
He's well enough to ask the doctor
to make a phone call for him.

320
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:33,150
- Who did he call?
- Gage whitney pace, which is a law firm, I think.

321
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,740
The second largest in dc.

322
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:36,990
Go grab your laptop, janis. You're coming with me.

323
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,430
I am?

324
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:39,540
Why?

325
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,400
Because we have to get to
tanner before his lawyers do

326
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:43,130
and because if I can get
almeida's location out of him,

327
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,570
I want you on-site to vet the
intelligence to our field teams.

328
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,310
- Go.
- Okay.

329
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:56,830
Tell me about emerson.

330
00:16:57,330 --> 00:17:00,390
He's british, former sas.

331
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:03,410
Urban warfare, sniping, close-quarter combat.

332
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:06,060
Saw action in beirut and mogadishu.

333
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,360
So he's good.

334
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,830
Extremely.

335
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:11,260
But he's not some wack job or ideologue.

336
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:15,530
He's about two things--
money and personal loyalty.

337
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:17,520
Sounds like you still admire him.

338
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:21,880
Listen, jack, he treated me like a
brother when I thought I had nobody else.

339
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:25,380
Is this going to be a problem?

340
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:28,740
No.

341
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:32,270
I know he's on the wrong side of this.

342
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:34,470
I'll do what has to be done.

343
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:54,310
We're here.

344
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:11,940
- Where's emerson?
- Inside. Come in.

345
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:21,760
David.

346
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,630
Good to see you.

347
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:29,090
Take mr. Bauer downstairs. I need to talk to tony.

348
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,150
What's going on?

349
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:42,950
Bringing in bauer is not worth the risk.

350
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,360
What are you talking about?

351
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,580
Have a seat.

352
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:56,450
Emerson will be right with you.

353
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,930
I'd still be in fbi custody if it wasn't for him.

354
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,510
Tony, you already made your case.

355
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:10,240
We can use him.

356
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,250
I considered it...

357
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:14,760
but I'm going a different way.

358
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:18,760
I owe him, david. You understand that?

359
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:20,570
Yeah, and I appreciate your sense of loyalty.

360
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:24,030
I always have, but this is business, tony.

361
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,320
You can't have A...

362
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,880
an unknown factor like jack bauer
coming in and messing things up.

363
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:35,000
so, what, you're going to kill him?

364
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:41,400
No, you are.

365
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:45,090
They're going to kill him.

366
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,400
- He'll get out of it.
- What if he can't?

367
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:51,900
Then jack's death solidifies
tony's position in the crew.

368
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:53,720
Tony was in fbi custody.

369
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:58,080
If he'd gone back in there by himself, the
suspicion would have rested on him alone.

370
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:00,260
So by deflecting it onto jack...

371
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:02,470
we keep tony's cover viable.

372
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:06,000
you knew this might happen the whole time.

373
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:08,080
Yes.

374
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:12,040
So did jack.

375
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:35,030
put your weapon down!

376
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:37,420
Put your weapon down or I will kill him!

377
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:42,100
I came here to do a job, not
be double-crossed by you.

378
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:47,040
U're already shorthanded. You need good
men, not like these two traffic cops.

379
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:48,910
Look what I've done to them.

380
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,620
I am here because I've got nowhere else to go.

381
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:56,720
Tony said if I helped you, you
could get me out of the country.

382
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,830
Look, if you don't believe me, pull the trigger.

383
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:12,500
what, are you crazy?

384
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:13,910
Kill him!

385
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:16,360
No.

386
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:23,380
kill him or I'm out of here.

387
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,780
Fine.

388
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:56,150
keep it.

389
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:15,090
*****

390
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:19,120
So you're requesting a priority
landing for flight 112 out of las vegas?

391
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,610
This is not a request. I'm forwarding
an urgent protocol from the white house.

392
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:24,840
And your name was...

393
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:28,720
larry moss, special agent in charge.

394
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:30,790
This is a matter of national security.

395
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:33,550
Agent moss, may I have your
level five access number?

396
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:37,460
6223-510.

397
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:39,150
Thank you, sir.

398
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:43,580
Flight 112 is moved to the head of the
queue and should be on the ground shortly.

399
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:45,170
Thank you.

400
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:51,240
President taylor, this is colonel ike dubaku.

401
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:57,970
As you have no doubt confirmed, the near-collision
at jfk international was no accident.

402
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:00,970
We have the cip device.

403
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:06,390
We have the capability to kill
tens of thousands of american

404
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:09,820
and we are prepared to do so.

405
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:15,660
I wanted you to hear it for yourself, prime
minister, so that you would understand my dilemma.

406
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,270
I see.

407
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,810
You are recalling the invasion force.

408
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:24,190
Well, that determination has yet to be made.

409
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:30,030
And this device over which dubaku has control, it
poses a significant risk to your people?

410
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:31,570
Yes.

411
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:36,170
It's a technology that has the
potential for mass civilian casualties.

412
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,270
And it puts the infrastructure
of my country in grave jeopardy.

413
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:40,720
What of sangala?

414
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:44,290
Believe me, no one is more
aware of what's at stake than I.

415
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:48,190
So you've been informed of the
situation in kasga province?

416
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:52,450
Juma's troops are advancing on a refugee camp.

417
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:54,630
Over 2,000 lives are threatened.

418
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,910
Mostly women and children.

419
00:23:56,980 --> 00:24:01,750
There is also the matter of those soldiers
who have, on the promise of american support,

420
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:05,550
deserted the regime and joined
my freedom fighters on the ground.

421
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:07,460
At least...

422
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:11,390
provide us the weapons we need
in order to defend ourselves.

423
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:14,480
You've been patient with us before, mr. Matobo.

424
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:17,680
I can only ask that you be patient again.

425
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:21,670
No please, if you'll excuse me.

426
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:27,340
Madame president, I implore
you, do not abandon my country.

427
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:31,270
Mr. Matobo, I will do everything that I can.

428
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:34,760
I count on you.

429
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,380
Thank you.

430
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:52,810
You didn't think that I would want
to know about the refugees in kasanga?

431
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:57,040
Madame president, you have enough to think
about without being burdened with details.

432
00:24:57,090 --> 00:25:01,000
Especially details that might push me
toward proceeding with the invasion.

433
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:06,420
Ma'am, you have to start focusing
on alternates to the invasion.

434
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:09,050
Give me a good alternative and I'll consider it.

435
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:13,260
I'm not saying it's a good
alternative, but it's the only one.

436
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:16,130
Comply with dubaku's demands.

437
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:18,900
Stand down the task force.

438
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:21,500
That's your recommendation?

439
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:23,910
- Back down?
- It is.

440
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:25,670
Damn it, ethan, you heard matobo.

441
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:29,160
He's has fighters on the ground counting on us.

442
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:32,200
Do you want me to be responsible
for another bay of pigs?

443
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:35,740
Kennedy survived the bay of
pigs, and you'll survive this.

444
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:43,020
A superpower has to act first and
foremost in its own best interests.

445
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,730
- Always?
- Always.

446
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,320
No apologies.

447
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:49,670
What about allowing a third party
to dictate its foreign policy--

448
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:52,140
- does a superpower do that?
- Yes,

449
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:53,760
if there's no other option.

450
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:56,660
And right now, there's not.

451
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,870
What have we heard from the fbi about
the search for almeida and bauer?

452
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:04,860
Nothing, ma'am.

453
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:07,060
Check with them anyway.

454
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,820
No hard feelings, jack?

455
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,610
Forget it.

456
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:22,250
Have to be careful in our
profession. I'm sure you understand.

457
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:25,760
- Yeah.
- We all know the drill.

458
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:31,960
Disagreements are fine, but when a
decision's made, fall in or you're gone.

459
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:34,950
I've heard a lot of guys say that.

460
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,070
Good to know you mean it.

461
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:46,590
Before you were subpoenaed, you traveled
the world, place to place, more than a year.

462
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,690
Why?

463
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,360
What were you looking for?

464
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:53,990
It doesn't really matter.

465
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:56,040
Whatever it was, I didn't find it.

466
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,950
You must have known what was waiting.

467
00:26:58,050 --> 00:26:59,390
Why'd you come back?

468
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,050
Wanted to know what it was
like to walk into a propeller.

469
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:04,360
That's funny.

470
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:06,750
But no, really.

471
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:11,220
Why?

472
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:15,660
This is my home.

473
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:20,310
That doesn't expelf in to the justice department.

474
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,790
Tony said you were in beirut and mogadishu.

475
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,450
And afghanistan.

476
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:31,800
Two tours. Went back a third
time as a private contractor.

477
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:37,020
Be polite, professional, and have a
plan to kill everyone you meet, right?

478
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:39,100
Pretty much.

479
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:41,290
That's the question, isn't it?

480
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:44,660
Where do the rules of engagement
end and the crimes begin?

481
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:46,900
You want to know why I came back?

482
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:49,000
That's why.

483
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,980
I'm not sure I follow.

484
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:53,390
I just got tired of talking to myself.

485
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:56,090
You see, I actually believe
everything I did was right.

486
00:27:56,130 --> 00:27:58,610
So I wanted to start a dialogue.

487
00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:01,410
Come clean, set the record straight.

488
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,400
First mistake.

489
00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:05,360
So I found out.

490
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:11,280
No one who hasn't been to the edge
and looked over can ever understand.

491
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,540
Yeah.

492
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,130
it's good to have you on board, jack.

493
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:19,430
yeah?

494
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,830
What was that about?

495
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,920
He's just trying to get a handle on me.

496
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:37,370
Watch yourself around him, jack.

497
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,090
And do not underestimate him.

498
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,800
I won'T.

499
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,600
All right, listen up.

500
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:50,840
I just got the call. We're a go.

501
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:53,690
A go for what? We don't even
know what the hell the job is.

502
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:56,350
Picking up a package, delivering it to our client.

503
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:58,070
Here's the location.

504
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:01,120
A residence at 167 foxhall road.

505
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:03,440
It belongs to the state
department. Memorize the layout.

506
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:07,210
We don't know the exact spot of the
pickup yet, but probably the master suite.

507
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,920
The package is a person.

508
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:11,000
Ye, it is.

509
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:16,050
Former prime minister matobo of sangala.

510
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:19,680
The assignment is to grab him
and deliver him to colonel dubaku.

511
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:21,210
The colonel wants to ask him some questions,

512
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:24,760
and as you can imagine, the
colonel can be quite persuasive.

513
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:29,530
Now, matobo hatight security, so finish
arming up, be prepared to engage.

514
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:31,430
We roll in two minutes.

515
00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:34,330
They're going to kidnap matobo. We
have to alert somebody and stop this.

516
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,010
No, we do nothing.

517
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:38,160
But you heard them-- they're going
to torture him and probably kill him.

518
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:40,640
Unfortunately, yes.

519
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:44,600
Matobo single-handedly led the fight
against genocide in his country.

520
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,140
- He doesn't deserve this.
- I understand that, chloe.

521
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:50,760
But if we don't go along with the grab, jack
and tony will not find colonel dubaku,

522
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:53,980
and we will not get to the
bottom of this conspiracy.

523
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:56,570
Agreed?

524
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:00,900
agreed.

525
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:29,740
I don't want you to wait for me.

526
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:30,540
Sir?

527
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:33,240
Just drive away. I'll call you when I need you.

528
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,040
You know I can't do that, Mr Taylor.

529
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:36,640
We're already off the manifest, Brian.

530
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:39,240
She won't talk to me unless I'm alone.

531
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:44,110
All right, I'll take up a position on the bridge.

532
00:30:44,145 --> 00:30:46,500
She'll never know I'm there.

533
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:49,670
All right.

534
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:24,240
Mr. Taylor.

535
00:31:24,275 --> 00:31:25,015
Sam.

536
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,595
I can't stay long.

537
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:30,565
What you told me on the phone, is it true?

538
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,570
Yes, they killed roger and
made it look like a suicide.

539
00:31:33,605 --> 00:31:34,545
Who? Who did this?

540
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:39,200
The same people who provided false documents to the
sec to show he'd been trading on inside information.

541
00:31:39,235 --> 00:31:40,095
Who arthey?

542
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:40,995
I don't know who they are.

543
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:43,100
They just said that they would
kill me if I said anything.

544
00:31:43,135 --> 00:31:44,120
Easy, easy, sam.

545
00:31:44,155 --> 00:31:45,880
Easy.

546
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,605
I loved him.

547
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,315
I know you did, sam.

548
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:54,440
But right now, I really need to know what happened.

549
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:58,000
Roger was tasked with auditing
the brokers in his department.

550
00:31:58,035 --> 00:31:58,910
That's how it started.

551
00:31:58,945 --> 00:31:59,690
When was this?

552
00:31:59,725 --> 00:32:00,415
January.

553
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:02,335
Uh, early january.

554
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:07,780
The compliance officer at his firm asked him to flag
any undisclosed ownership in securities positions.

555
00:32:07,815 --> 00:32:08,902
I don't understand.

556
00:32:08,937 --> 00:32:09,955
Basically, kickbacks.

557
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:11,675
But what he found was something else.

558
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:14,825
Two of his portfolio managers
had taken on a new client.

559
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:18,920
The bahamas branch of switzerland's
oldest bank: Bank lausanne international.

560
00:32:18,955 --> 00:32:19,885
What was wrong with that?

561
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:24,320
Bank lausanne's records revealed that it was
actively trading with firms doing business in sangala.

562
00:32:24,355 --> 00:32:25,275
Sangala?

563
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:29,045
It jumped out at roger, too, for
obvious reasons, and digging deeper,

564
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:32,780
he uncovered other blind accounts
that were copying the bank's trades.

565
00:32:32,815 --> 00:32:34,770
Which accounts?

566
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:39,820
Accounts that were traced to a senior
member of your wife's administration.

567
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:41,775
Who?

568
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:43,225
I don't know.

569
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:47,130
But whoever it was had a vested
interest in the proposed military action.

570
00:32:47,165 --> 00:32:49,115
Somebody who was betting against her,

571
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:50,990
who didn't think she'd be able
to pull it off politically?

572
00:32:51,025 --> 00:32:54,900
Betting heavily in 10,000-share blocks.

573
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:59,690
Roger was a day or two away from
presenting her with the evidence.

574
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:02,915
It's all here.

575
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:07,680
Account numbers, trading
records, everything that he knew.

576
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,730
I'm sorry that I can't help you out more.

577
00:33:10,765 --> 00:33:11,475
Samantha...

578
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:13,075
I've given you all I can.

579
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:16,230
Do what you have to do, but leave me out of it.

580
00:33:16,265 --> 00:33:18,107
Please?

581
00:33:18,142 --> 00:33:19,950
Okay.

582
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,240
Thank you.

583
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:46,985
Is tanner in there?

584
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:49,500
His condition is still listed as critical.

585
00:33:49,535 --> 00:33:50,670
Are his lawyers here yet?

586
00:33:50,705 --> 00:33:51,295
No.

587
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:53,355
But they will be any minute.

588
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:55,030
Okay, get wn to the lobby
and keep an eye out for them.

589
00:33:55,065 --> 00:33:57,070
Call me as soon as they enter the hospital.

590
00:33:57,105 --> 00:33:58,617
Got it.

591
00:33:58,652 --> 00:34:00,130
Come on.

592
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,005
hello, mr. Tanner.

593
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,530
I'm agent walker. This is agent gold.

594
00:34:12,565 --> 00:34:14,155
We're with the fbi.

595
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:16,290
I think you remember me.

596
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:19,380
I know you're in pain, so I'll make this brief.

597
00:34:19,415 --> 00:34:22,430
Tell me where tony almeida is.

598
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:26,590
Does almeida have another base of operations?

599
00:34:26,625 --> 00:34:29,590
Is that where the cip device is?

600
00:34:29,890 --> 00:34:30,865
My lawyers...

601
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:33,455
cannot help you, mr. Tanner.

602
00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:37,530
You're going to spend the rest of your
life in prison if you don't cooperate.

603
00:34:37,565 --> 00:34:41,505
But if you do, I give you my word, I
will personally vouch for you.

604
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:45,980
Helping me find the device can go a
long way towards reducing your sentence.

605
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:49,590
I'm sorry. Is something funny?

606
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:52,550
They'd never let that happen.

607
00:34:52,585 --> 00:34:53,575
Who is they?

608
00:34:53,610 --> 00:34:56,150
Colonel dubaku? Is that who tony
almeida takes his orders from?

609
00:34:56,185 --> 00:34:59,280
Do you work for him too?

610
00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:03,555
Go away.

611
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:06,330
Open your eyes, mr. Tanner.

612
00:35:06,365 --> 00:35:08,850
I said open your eyes.

613
00:35:08,885 --> 00:35:09,965
Look at me!

614
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,270
Is dubaku here in this country?

615
00:35:11,305 --> 00:35:12,690
Does he have the device?

616
00:35:12,725 --> 00:35:13,645
Renee...

617
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,440
renee, renee...please.

618
00:35:15,475 --> 00:35:17,110
Renee...

619
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:20,770
I don't know what you're doing.

620
00:35:20,805 --> 00:35:22,270
What are you doing?

621
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:25,870
- walker.
- Tanner's lawyers just arrived.

622
00:35:25,905 --> 00:35:27,640
All right, thanks.

623
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:34,555
His legal team is here.

624
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:35,625
I need you to stall them.

625
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:37,135
Me? How am I supposed to do at?

626
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:38,575
I don't care. Make something up.

627
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:40,330
Just keep them out of this
room as long as you can.

628
00:35:40,365 --> 00:35:41,522
I'not coortable with this.

629
00:35:41,557 --> 00:35:42,645
Comfortable with what?

630
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:45,790
We are breaking about 50 federal
guidelines just by being here.

631
00:35:45,825 --> 00:35:46,555
Listen to me, janis.

632
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:48,325
This man is our only lead.

633
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,450
That man asked for legal counsel.

634
00:35:50,485 --> 00:35:52,015
I heard him.

635
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:54,845
Thousands of lives are at stake here.

636
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:57,850
We either bend the rules a little bit
right now or we lose this chance forever.

637
00:35:57,885 --> 00:35:59,112
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

638
00:35:59,147 --> 00:36:00,305
I just...I can'T.

639
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:03,790
Look, tony almeida and jack bauer
escaped custody on my watch.

640
00:36:03,825 --> 00:36:06,820
I have to make this right.

641
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:10,710
You either help me or you don'T.

642
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,360
Okay.

643
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:41,450
*********

644
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,770
You're out of time, mr. Tanner.

645
00:36:43,805 --> 00:36:46,180
Tell me what you know.

646
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,885
You can do what you want to me.

647
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:51,800
I'm not going to tell you a damn thing.

648
00:36:56,450 --> 00:36:58,270
who do you work for?

649
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,145
You can't do this...

650
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:04,975
where is almeida?

651
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:08,670
How do I find the cip device? Tell me now.

652
00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:12,630
My lawyers...

653
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:38,450
you can't do this.

654
00:37:38,485 --> 00:37:41,165
You're fbi.

655
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,770
This is illegal.

656
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,980
I have rights.

657
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:51,180
I suggest you use your last breath wisely.

658
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,850
Go to hell.

659
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:19,790
I assure you, I'm taking this very seriously.

660
00:38:19,825 --> 00:38:20,935
Then tell us where our client is.

661
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:22,690
As I said, he was moved for security reasons.

662
00:38:22,725 --> 00:38:23,820
Into the annex?

663
00:38:23,855 --> 00:38:24,425
Yes, sir.

664
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:25,395
Then why isn't he there?

665
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:27,810
Listen, if I can just get on
the phone, I'll call my office.

666
00:38:27,845 --> 00:38:28,755
We'll get to the bottom of this...

667
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:30,990
we've had enough of your help, agent gold.

668
00:38:31,025 --> 00:38:31,965
I...

669
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,700
I'm genuinely confused too.

670
00:38:33,735 --> 00:38:34,690
Excuse me.

671
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:37,920
We're trying to find our client, mr. Alan tanner.

672
00:38:37,955 --> 00:38:40,080
Just a minute.

673
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:44,860
I've got a ventilator malfunction.

674
00:38:44,895 --> 00:38:46,905
Damn it! He's coding!

675
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:48,960
Get a team and a crash cart over here, stat!

676
00:38:48,995 --> 00:38:51,030
Code blue: Room 421, tanner.

677
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,445
It's blocked or something.

678
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:57,580
- We have to get in there!
- I'm trying to!

679
00:38:57,615 --> 00:38:59,630
- It won't push.
- Open this door!

680
00:38:59,665 --> 00:39:01,635
This is an emergency!

681
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:02,710
I can't get the door open.

682
00:39:02,745 --> 00:39:03,415
It's jammed!

683
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:05,120
Is somebody in there with him?

684
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:10,090
He's all yours, counselor.

685
00:39:10,125 --> 00:39:10,995
Wait a minute.

686
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:12,350
We need to talk to you!

687
00:39:12,385 --> 00:39:13,145
Renee...

688
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:14,080
you don't want to know, janis.

689
00:39:14,115 --> 00:39:15,315
Don't ask.

690
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:17,960
Have agent alves drive you back to the office.

691
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:24,680
- Hillinger.
- Let me speak to larry.

692
00:39:24,715 --> 00:39:27,430
Sir, I've got walker on the line.

693
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:31,525
Did you get anything?

694
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:32,755
I may have a lead on aeida.

695
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:35,950
Apparently, there's a plot in place
against the former prime minister sangala.

696
00:39:35,985 --> 00:39:36,805
Matobo?

697
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:39,350
Tanner says almeida's crew
has a plan to abduct him.

698
00:39:39,385 --> 00:39:40,945
- When?
- Pretty much now.

699
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:44,680
Listen, larry, if almeida's still a part of this
and we can get there before him, we can set a trap.

700
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:46,005
All right.

701
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:49,330
I'll alert the prime minister's
security detail and scramble a tac team.

702
00:39:49,365 --> 00:39:51,590
Matobo's housed in a state department residence:

703
00:39:51,625 --> 00:39:53,282
167 foxhall road.

704
00:39:53,317 --> 00:39:54,905
I'm on my way.

705
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:56,430
Renee, do not go in alone.

706
00:39:56,465 --> 00:39:57,220
Wait for backup.

707
00:39:57,255 --> 00:39:58,500
Right.

708
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:12,870
Is this major etolo?

709
00:40:12,905 --> 00:40:13,475
It is.

710
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:15,240
This is special agent larry moss, fbi.

711
00:40:15,275 --> 00:40:16,727
This is not a drill.

712
00:40:16,762 --> 00:40:18,145
Code: Alpha alpha delta.

713
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:19,290
Lock the prime minister down.

714
00:40:19,325 --> 00:40:21,140
I repeat, lock him down.

715
00:40:21,175 --> 00:40:22,170
Yes, sir.

716
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:53,270
we're clear. Go.

717
00:41:00,910 --> 00:41:01,945
Where's matobo?

718
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:03,210
I don't know...

719
00:41:03,245 --> 00:41:04,440
where is he?

720
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:06,220
Where is he?

721
00:41:06,255 --> 00:41:07,660
I got him!

722
00:41:23,010 --> 00:41:24,490
drop the weapon! Now!

723
00:41:24,525 --> 00:41:26,317
Put the gun down!

724
00:41:26,352 --> 00:41:28,110
On your knees!

725
00:41:29,450 --> 00:41:31,215
Where is matobo?

726
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:34,100
You will not be able to get to him now.

727
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:16,165
What is happening, ule?

728
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,060
Who is doing this to us?

729
00:42:18,095 --> 00:42:19,415
Stay calm.

730
00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:21,860
It's going to be all right.

731
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:29,610
It's dead.

732
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:35,560
- What you got?
- It's a safe room; reinforced concrete.

733
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:38,840
Why the hell didn't we know about this?

734
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:43,720
You have three seconds to open the door.

735
00:42:43,755 --> 00:42:45,870
- One... I can'T.

736
00:42:45,905 --> 00:42:46,485
Two...

737
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:48,785
it can't be unlocked from the outside.

738
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:51,050
It can only be opened from the inside.

739
00:42:59,190 --> 00:43:00,525
Jack, if we leave here without matobo,

740
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:03,590
we lose our only chance of getting at dubaku.
