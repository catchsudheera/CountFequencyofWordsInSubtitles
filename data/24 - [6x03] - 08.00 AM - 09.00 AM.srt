1
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,111
<i>(man) America has been victimised again.</i>

2
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,557
<i>Last night's terrorist attack in San Antonio
was the latest in this series of bombings</i>

3
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,029
<i>that began 11 weeks ago
in ten different cities.</i>

4
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,153
Retrieve the package.
Call me when you have it.

5
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,834
- What happened?
- You shouldn't have come here, Scott.

6
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:46,469
I don't wanna hurt you,
but I will unless you do exactly what I say.

7
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:51,279
I'm Mr Al-Rezani's attorney.
There are no terrorists here.

8
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,999
Yes, it's Sandra Palmer.
I'd like to speak with my brother.

9
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:58,870
The FBI was just here, and they
wanted access to the IAA's personnel records.

10
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,474
I have to do whatever I can
to stop these attacks.

11
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:06,156
That includes giving law enforcement
the authority to follow up every single lead.

12
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,276
- I can't find the files.
- They've been erased.

13
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,352
Don't try to recall them.
I used the shredding program.

14
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,874
- Sandra, what are you doing?
- You're under arrest.

15
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:17,236
- Take Mr Al-Rezani into custody.
- Wait. He has nothing to do with this.

16
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,679
- Don't move. Where is Assad?
- Put down your weapon.

17
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:27,550
I came alone. Fayed set you up. He provided
CTU with the coordinates to this house.

18
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:29,915
Move! Move!

19
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,158
Most of my people and the governments
that support us agreed to a cease-fire.

20
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:40,550
- Fayed wants to sabotage it?
- Yes. But finding Fayed is the key.

21
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,554
- These are Fayed's men.
- They're going in the subway.

22
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,073
They can't get on that train.

23
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:48,835
<i>(Assad) Only the bomber is getting on
the train. The other man is the handler.</i>

24
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:52,071
<i>(Jack) You follow the handler.
I'm going after the bomber.</i>

25
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,952
<i>(screaming)</i>

26
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,919
<i>(phone rings)</i>

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,230
- We're heading in your direction.
- I'll find you.

28
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,471
Stay with the handler.
He's our only connection to Fayed.

29
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:39,470
- You still have Fayed's man in sight?
- He's in a grey sedan, about six cars ahead.

30
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,996
<i>(phone rings)</i>

31
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,231
<i>- Yes?
- (Fayed) Are you on schedule?</i>

32
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:56,198
There was traffic by Union Station.
I'm on the road now.

33
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,910
There has been a change. I need you to stop
in Newhall before you come back here.

34
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,356
The Americans will be feeling helpless.
I'm making the call.

35
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,157
<i>(Buchanan) The casualty estimate
in St Louis has risen to 112.</i>

36
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:13,313
The mall attack in Baltimore is even worse.
Over 200 dead,

37
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,669
many of them children.

38
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:20,992
My God. What about
the bomb in Los Angeles?

39
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,231
Jack Bauer averted the attack
at Union Station.

40
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:28,108
Surveillance from Metro Transit
also confirmed he's working with Assad.

41
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,838
Have you made contact?

42
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,469
Jack's been dark since he called
to warn us about Fayed and we didn't listen.

43
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,316
I didn't listen.

44
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,918
Fayed is demanding
to speak with the president.

45
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,913
Mr President, we're receiving a call
on a scrambled channel from Fayed, sir.

46
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,515
- He's demanding to speak with you.
- Put him on.

47
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,639
This is President Palmer.

48
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,794
Mr President, we've proven
we can strike at you any time, anywhere.

49
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:04,590
But I am prepared to offer you a cease-fire,
if you meet my demands.

50
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,113
Your demands?

51
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:11,715
We met your demands when you deceived us
about Assad being behind these attacks.

52
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,792
Now you expect me to accept
your assurances of a cease-fire?

53
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:19,032
I expect you will take action that promises
to avoid the loss of more American lives.

54
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,916
What do you want?

55
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,197
You are holding 110
so-called enemy combatants

56
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:31,195
at your Palmdale military facility
in violation of international law.

57
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,999
You must have all these freedom fighters

58
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,870
on a nonmilitary aircraft in the air
by the end of the hour.

59
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:43,192
The pilot will be told the destination
once the plane is outside your airspace.

60
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,714
If I agree, there is not enough time...

61
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,793
You'll find a way. If you don't
release the prisoners by the deadline,

62
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:54,078
<i>the consequences will be
immediate and devastating.</i>

63
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,152
<i>I will only make this offer once,
Mr President.</i>

64
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:02,629
For your country's sake, I hope you accept it.

65
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,399
Is that what these attacks have been about?
Releasing the prisoners?

66
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:14,759
Sir, I feel it's wishful thinking
to assume this is Fayed's endgame.

67
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:18,549
Contact Palmdale. Find out what
would be involved in making this happen.

68
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,470
Yes, sir.

69
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:24,873
Mr President, you cannot seriously consider
giving in to this man's demands.

70
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,997
I mean, you said yourself,
Fayed cannot be trusted.

71
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:33,279
No, he can't. I do not believe he has
any intention of stopping these attacks.

72
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,955
Not permanently. But doing this
buys us more time to find Fayed.

73
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:40,271
At the very least it gives the country
a respite from the bombings.

74
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:43,955
Sir, you'd be releasing
110 extremely dangerous terrorists.

75
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,190
Karen, I am very well aware of that.

76
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,431
But unless we find Fayed, I may be forced to.

77
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,595
- Oh, no. We got a problem.
- What?

78
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:09,037
He's heading north. The farther he gets,
the less traffic we'll have to hide in.

79
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,839
It'll be hard to track him to Fayed
without him seeing us.

80
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:16,152
- What else can we do?
- Call CTU. They'll give us satellite coverage.

81
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,754
No CTU. They killed my men.
They tried to kill me.

82
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,229
Fayed made them believe
you were behind the bombings.

83
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,709
I will not work with my enemies.

84
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:29,272
You are working with one now. You might
hate this country, you might hate its values.

85
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:34,036
If you're serious about disarming, bringing
your organisation and others to the table,

86
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,236
then you know you have to compromise.

87
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:41,792
- That is your political reality.
- What's to say they won't put me in prison?

88
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:46,192
I can't tell you they won't, but right now
that is our only lead to Fayed.

89
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,750
- Make the call.
- Thank you.

90
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,517
- Morris, I need you to load this.
- What is it?

91
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:01,434
Fayed is asking the president
to release all the prisoners from Palmdale.

92
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,590
We need to vet each one in case he does.

93
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:09,073
He won't. They are serious high-grade
terror suspects. No one's letting them go.

94
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,391
Excuse me. Are you refusing to do this?

95
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:17,156
Give this to the girls in archives. I'm working
up Fayed threads. It's more important.

96
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,755
I don't care what you think is important.
It's not your place to tell me.

97
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,718
Just calm down.
I'm trying to help you do yourjob.

98
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:28,396
You have to evaluate directives. Don't waste
the time of your most important analysts.

99
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,469
- I'm...
- Morris.

100
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,755
What? What?

101
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,990
Put filters on each of these files.

102
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,551
If I don't have results on my screen
in 20 minutes, you are out of here.

103
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:41,154
<i>- Grow up.
- (phone rings)</i>

104
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,118
<i>- O'Brian.
- Chloe, this is Jack.</i>

105
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:48,876
- I didn't think I'd ever hear your voice again.
- I need to speak to Buchanan.

106
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,791
Hold on.

107
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,349
Buchanan.

108
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,989
<i>- (Chloe) It's Jack on line one.
- Jack, where are you?</i>

109
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,753
With Assad,
tracking a suspect in the train bombing.

110
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,957
We know you're working with Assad.
Are you sure you can trust him?

111
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,109
I think so.

112
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,511
- What do you need?
- Suspect's on Florence, crossing Ormond.

113
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,831
We believe he'll lead us to Fayed.
We need satellite support.

114
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,559
Logging on to the NSA server now.

115
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:18,270
Fayed contacted the president and demanded
he release the prisoners at Palmdale.

116
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,032
What's the president's position?

117
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:23,078
If we don't find Fayed by 9am,
he'll go through with it.

118
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:27,790
It'll take me ten minutes to get satellite
coverage. I had to use the subserver.

119
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:31,429
That's too long. He's entering Route 7.
If we try to follow, he'll see us.

120
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,476
Chloe, can you speed up access?

121
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:36,028
Sat queue's overloaded.
The country is on high alert.

122
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:41,877
- We'll use Caltrans cameras to track him.
- There isn't a traffic cam on Route 7. I looked.

123
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:45,236
Figure out another way to track him
till the satellite's up.

124
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,278
- Where's your nearest TAC team?
- 12 miles away.

125
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,272
Send 'em in my direction.
I'll get back to you.

126
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:57,596
- Do you think this man will recognise you?
- No. What do you have in mind?

127
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,636
All right, thanks. Manning on comm.

128
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,156
I spoke to Jack. He's surveilling
one of Fayed's men and needs backup.

129
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,074
<i>- Where is he?
- Florence Boulevard, near Route 7.</i>

130
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,550
He's running this operation with Assad.

131
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:15,030
<i>Did I hear that correctly?
We're working with Assad?</i>

132
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,315
<i>Rendezvous with them and lend support.</i>

133
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:22,474
All warrants on Assad are rescinded
for the time being, understood?

134
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,118
Curtis?

135
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,916
We're on our way.

136
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,671
Don't get up.

137
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,670
<i>(horn)</i>

138
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,270
Hey! What's wrong with you?
I know you saw me coming!

139
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:41,557
- It was my right of way!
- You telling me I don't know how to drive?

140
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,677
- I'm talking to you!
- You all right? I saw the whole thing.

141
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:48,469
- This has got nothing to do with you!
- I'm a witness. You drove into him.

142
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,314
What is it with you people?
You're gonna stick up for him?

143
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,437
Fine, I'll wait here until the police arrive.

144
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,358
Screw both of you. Screw you!

145
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,670
Where are you going? Hey! Hey!

146
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,320
This is your fault!

147
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,550
I saw his license for the police.

148
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,632
I can't wait for the police.
I can't drive this.

149
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,359
I need to be somewhere.
I'll deal with this later.

150
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,431
Where are you going?

151
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:20,629
- Newhall. I was getting on Route 7.
- So was I. I'll drop you there. Come. Come.

152
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,392
Thank you.

153
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,154
<i>(phone rings)</i>

154
00:11:55,320 --> 00:12:00,519
I hope you won't let that bastard get away
with this. You must file a police report.

155
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,591
I know.

156
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,756
Come on.

157
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,719
<i>- (woman) CTU.
- I need to speak with Bill Buchanan.</i>

158
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,074
<i>Hold, please.</i>

159
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,479
<i>(phone rings)</i>

160
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,432
- Buchanan.
- Fayed's man is now in a car with Assad.

161
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:21,876
- What happened?
- Suspect was in a traffic incident. Listen.

162
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,269
Assad left his phone open so we can monitor.

163
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,989
I'll be following roughly two miles behind
in a white Jeep Cherokee.

164
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,469
Assad will let us know where he's going.

165
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:34,109
- I'm ready to transfer you into the call.
- Go ahead, Jack.

166
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:40,231
Bill, they can't hear us on our side.
You should be on the call now.

167
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,432
I don't know Newhall very well.
I need you to guide me.

168
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,794
<i>(man) I will.</i>

169
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,793
Nadia, do an all-agency data pull on Newhall.
Set up parameters for a sort.

170
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,872
When we get satellite,
make sure we have coverage of that area.

171
00:12:55,960 --> 00:13:00,795
Let Curtis know he's to intercept Jack
on Route 7 on the way to Newhall.

172
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,915
- Fayed.
- What is it?

173
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,959
Our scout reports increased activity
around the Palmdale military prison.

174
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,759
The transport buses are starting to arrive.

175
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:18,198
Good. By the time our brothers are on the
aircraft, it will be too late for the Americans

176
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:22,478
- to realise what's happened.
- We still don't have the component.

177
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,830
We will. Ahmed should be
on his way to pick it up now.

178
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,278
- Scott, is that you?
- Yeah.

179
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:43,033
Honey, we were beginning to get worried.

180
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,874
- My God, Ahmed, what happened?
- Mom, he has a gun.

181
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,630
- What's going on? What is this?
- Where's Ray?

182
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,470
Just put the gun down
and tell me what's happening.

183
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,835
Call him.

184
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,194
Ray!

185
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,155
Yeah?

186
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,037
- What the hell?
- I don't wanna hurt you,

187
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:13,194
but I will unless you do exactly what I say.
You're a nurse, right? You have bandages?

188
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,999
- Yeah.
- Go get them. Now!

189
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,515
You two, on the couch, now. Come on.

190
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:31,759
Sit down now.

191
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,636
I need you to patch this leg,
stop the bleeding.

192
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,792
My God, Stan was right.
You are a terrorist.

193
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:47,031
- Stan's dead. He killed him.
- What?

194
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,918
- I can't stop this bleeding.
- Don't tell me that!

195
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,073
The wound's too deep. You have muscle
tissue damage. You need to see a doctor.

196
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,479
Just bandage it!

197
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,199
There's a package in there. I'm supposed to
take it to a man who has an item for me.

198
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:07,113
- Press.
- Ah!

199
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,911
Obviously I can't do that now,
so you're gonna have to.

200
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,673
I'm not leaving you alone with my family.

201
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,196
Your family will be safe
when you do what I say.

202
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:22,877
When you pick up the item, you'll call me
and I'll give you further instructions.

203
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:35,396
- What's in this package?
- None of your concern. Just make the drop.

204
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,789
Grab that phone and come here.

205
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,869
Come here, come here.
Understand this.

206
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:47,478
If I see anyone - the police, FBI, anybody
outside this house, or if you take too long -

207
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,994
your wife and son are dead.

208
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,274
Do you understand me? Look at me!

209
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,271
I understand.

210
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:58,989
Where am I going?

211
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:04,712
There's an address on the front pocket
of that backpack. It's a man named Marcus.

212
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,675
Go.

213
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,710
<i>(phone rings)</i>

214
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,553
- How far away are you?
- Less than five minutes.

215
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:55,599
Get there fast. Assad and Fayed's man
are on open road, five miles ahead.

216
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,669
Got it.

217
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,751
- Oh, darling?
- What?

218
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:01,877
- Since when do you take Milo's side?
- You're doing it again.

219
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,713
- What?
- Pick on your bosses when you're stressed.

220
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,951
- Milo's not my boss, heaven forbid.
- He might as well be.

221
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,508
He could bounce you.
I think you want it sometimes.

222
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,318
And why would I want that?

223
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,278
I don't know.
It's your character flaw, not mine.

224
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:24,029
The files you wanted are all unlocked.
They'll be on your screen in a minute.

225
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,429
Good.

226
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,314
Mr President.

227
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:43,313
I just got off the phone with CTU.
They've reconnected with Jack Bauer.

228
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:47,109
- Where is he?
- He's following one of Fayed's operatives.

229
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,637
CTU is coordinating support for Jack. They
believe this man will lead them to Fayed.

230
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,870
Did CTU offer a time frame for locating him?

231
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:57,396
No, sir. At this point,
any estimates are premature.

232
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:00,711
- Have you spoken with the Palmdale facility?
- And the airfield.

233
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:04,395
If we wanna have the prisoners in the air
before the end of the hour,

234
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:09,110
we have to have them on buses
and on the road within the next ten minutes.

235
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,510
If you still want to proceed with that option.

236
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:17,749
I know you disapprove of my decision,
but unless Jack and CTU

237
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:22,072
call to say they have Fayed,
there is no other option here.

238
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,674
- Tell them to load the buses.
- Yes, Mr President.

239
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,950
<i>(Assad) Sand Canyon Road.</i>

240
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,719
What?

241
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:48,794
I was just remembering. I had a friend
who lived on Sand Canyon Road.

242
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:58,037
We can take the service route from here.

243
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:14,915
They're two miles ahead.
We can monitor with this cellphone.

244
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,309
CTU wants you on comm.

245
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,358
- You copy?
- Ten-four.

246
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,236
<i>- CTU, this is Manning.
- (Bill) Go ahead.</i>

247
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,754
I'm with Jack.
Do we have satellite access yet?

248
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:35,196
- It's coming up. Is Jack on the line?
- I'm here, Bill.

249
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:39,353
We're redirecting the NSA satellite to the
area around Sand Canyon Road exit marker.

250
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,432
When we have a fix on Assad's vehicle,
we'll upload it to your GPS.

251
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,555
Copy that.

252
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,119
It's good to see you, Jack.

253
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:57,029
I'm sorry for what you were put through.

254
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,759
- But I'm glad you're back.
- Thanks.

255
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:05,036
Now you have to work with Assad.
Doesn't that bother you?

256
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:13,995
The man's a terrorist, responsible for taking
hundreds, maybe thousands of innocent lives

257
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:18,517
over the past 20 years.
Doesn't that mean anything to you?

258
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,788
I don't know what means
anything any more, Curtis.

259
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,670
I spent my whole life defending
this country against people like Assad.

260
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:33,469
And now he's trying to disarm his people,
renounce terrorism.

261
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:37,030
- The playing field has changed.
- That doesn't change Assad's past.

262
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:41,557
We have to make sure that
he pays for the crimes that he's committed.

263
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:46,794
If he's our only chance at a peaceful
resolution to this, that might not happen.

264
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,155
Anyway, it's not our call to make.

265
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,788
We'll see.

266
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,190
What is that supposed to mean?

267
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,315
Nothing.

268
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,637
Good.

269
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,798
This isn't working.

270
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:13,192
There's still too much pain.
I need something stronger.

271
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:17,114
Uh, there are some
prescription painkillers in the kitchen.

272
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,589
Get them, and some water.

273
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:22,638
Make sure I can see you.

274
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:27,433
They're in the cabinet over the TV.

275
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,271
Give it to me.

276
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,314
Sit down.

277
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:28,200
Sit down!

278
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,559
Sit down, sweetie.

279
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,996
Form an orderly line.

280
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,435
Head count will be taken.

281
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:06,035
Then, and only then,
you'll be loaded onto those buses.

282
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:11,513
Understand, any problems you cause
will only delay this process.

283
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,235
Get in line.

284
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,795
I'll tell him. Right.

285
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:43,032
Uh, that was the FBI.
Your sister, she's been arrested.

286
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,078
- What? When?
- Less than an hour ago.

287
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:49,630
FBI agents were sent to the offices
of the Islamic-American Alliance

288
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:55,238
to serve a warrant for their personnel files.
Sandra deleted them in front of the agents.

289
00:23:55,320 --> 00:24:00,952
- They had no choice but to arrest her.
- Dammit. Where has she been taken, Tom?

290
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:04,999
She's being detained.
One of our provisional facilities.

291
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,229
<i>(woman) Yes, sir.</i>

292
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,311
<i>(yelling, chanting)</i>

293
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,515
Walid, I'm so sorry I got you into this.

294
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:35,593
I deleted those files. It wasn't right
for them to arrest you for my actions.

295
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:39,673
Don't apologise. You were protecting
the rights of innocent Americans.

296
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:44,436
That's what this country stands for,
even if the government's forgotten.

297
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,629
Back away. Move back.
Come on. That's it.

298
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,235
You take him.

299
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:56,118
Where are you taking him? Walid?

300
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,872
I'll be all right.

301
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,838
Over here, Ms Palmer.

302
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,751
Take off her cuffs.

303
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,669
For you.

304
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,313
I'll be right here.

305
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,551
<i>- Hello?
- (woman) Please hold for the president.</i>

306
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,591
- What were you thinking deleting those files?
- I was standing up to an unlawful seizure.

307
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,910
You making a point
is the last thing I need today.

308
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,470
I ordered your release.
Agents have instructions to take you home.

309
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:30,597
I don't wanna be released.
I wanna fight this,

310
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:34,559
bring attention to the liberties
your administration allowed to be violated.

311
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,995
- Do you have any idea what's going on?
- Of course.

312
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:40,993
Innocent people are dying all over
the country. You make a civil rights case now.

313
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:45,392
Somebody has to. If you're gonna
release anybody, it should be Walid.

314
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:48,278
He's the head of the organisation
under investigation.

315
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:52,239
The FBI wants to hold him until they know
what was in those files you deleted.

316
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:57,155
There is nothing incriminating on those files.
You have my word. Walid is innocent.

317
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,993
Then Walid has nothing
to worry about, Sandra.

318
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,038
Listen, I don't have time for this.

319
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,476
You are released.
Go home. I will call you later.

320
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:16,759
- I need to speak with Walid.
- That's not going to happen.

321
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:19,752
I'm his attorney.
You have to give me access to him.

322
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,912
Don't tell me what I have to do.
I'm following orders.

323
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,037
- Walid has rights.
- Limited rights, Ms Palmer.

324
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:29,192
He's being held under
the revised enemy combatant statute.

325
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:32,317
Applying this statute
to somebody like him is ridiculous.

326
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,517
Is the law being
completely thrown out of the window?

327
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:40,754
When you're through with the lectures,
I have orders to drive you home.

328
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,831
Ma'am?

329
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:51,478
Stay to the left.
Once inside the secure zone, you will disrobe.

330
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:56,076
After a cavity search,
you'll be given back your clothing.

331
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,713
- Sir, you have to keep moving.
- I don't care. I'm innocent.

332
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,836
I wanna talk to somebody in authority.

333
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:05,593
- We're not gonna ask you again.
- Don't touch me.

334
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,995
- Let him alone!
- Sir, get back in line.

335
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:11,548
Not until you let go of that man.

336
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,153
Take your hands off me.

337
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,678
Take him to interrogation.

338
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,954
Do you live around here?

339
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,553
No.

340
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,870
Visiting relatives?

341
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,952
- Why do you ask?
- To make sure you can get back to your car.

342
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:57,316
- I'll be OK.
- "I'll be OK."

343
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:02,076
My son, he says this. He has a memory
like a fish. His mother is very worried.

344
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:07,069
On the next corner, make a right.
Drop me off at the end of the street.

345
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:10,516
- Did you copy that?
- It's the 6500 block of Alderton.

346
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:14,434
Bring up the data on all buildings
within a half mile and begin a pre-sort.

347
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,873
Like I'm doing already?

348
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,439
Right over here.

349
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:42,395
- All right, thanks again for your help.
- Please, it's nothing.

350
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:53,670
He's crossing 64th Road, heading towards
the commercial district. I'm turning around.

351
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:57,150
- There he is.
- We've acquired the suspect on satellite.

352
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:17,553
- Have your men set up a moving perimeter.
- Collier, take your men across 64th.

353
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:20,438
Set up a moving perimeter behind the target.

354
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:24,433
- He'll be well trained. Be careful.
- My men know theirjob.

355
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,430
- Do I know you?
- No, but I know you.

356
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:31,398
He's entering a commercial building
one block south of you.

357
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:35,632
Copy that. Boorman,
we're gonna take Assad with us.

358
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:39,269
- Watch him. Search him for weapons.
- Assad is part of this operation.

359
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,794
Not any more.

360
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,955
Wait. Wait.

361
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:55,199
I'll take care of it
as soon as this is over. I promise.

362
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,188
Thank you.

363
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:09,317
It's a self-storage facility -
one floor, 200 units.

364
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:42,199
<i>- Boorman, keep him here.
- Team leader, do you copy?</i>

365
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,713
Go ahead, Collier.

366
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:47,190
I see two dozen cases of ammunition,
boxes with Czech writing.

367
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:50,150
This is a dead drop. Fayed's not here.

368
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,071
We only have a few minutes, Jack.

369
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:55,709
If the suspect won't lead us to Fayed
to stop the prisoner exchange,

370
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,758
we have to move now,
get information through interrogation.

371
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:02,992
Bill, that's too risky. We have no
guarantee we can make him talk in time.

372
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:06,117
That's a risk we have to take.
Move your men into position.

373
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:12,230
Understood. All teams, we're moving in.
Silent approach, non-lethal force.

374
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,950
<i>(clang)</i>

375
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,515
Get out where I can see you!

376
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:52,473
Step out with your hands up!

377
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,512
Curtis! Everyone back!

378
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:12,756
Get a fire hose.
Get the fire department and ambulances here!

379
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:17,277
Bill, it's Jack. Suspect is dead.
He was taking a laptop out of the storage unit.

380
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,476
We'll check the hard drive, but it's damaged.

381
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:22,233
Understood, Jack.
I need the president.

382
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,717
Yeah, got the feed
of the prisoners at Palmdale.

383
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,839
<i>(intercom beeps)</i>

384
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:35,390
<i>- Yes?
- (woman) I have Bill Buchanan on the line.</i>

385
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,311
<i>- Put him on.
- Yes, sir.</i>

386
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:42,872
- We've had a setback to our operation.
- What happened, Bill?

387
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:47,033
The suspect Jack was following
killed himself rather than be apprehended.

388
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:50,749
We're examining for evidence.
There's no telling how long that will take

389
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,956
or if it will lead us to Fayed. I'm sorry.

390
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:56,919
<i>- So am I. Keep me informed.
- Of course.</i>

391
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:03,552
If you're intent on following through with
this prisoner release, we await your orders.

392
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,673
Load them on the plane.

393
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:23,718
This is Lennox. The president has made his
decision. Load the prisoners on the plane.

394
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:29,272
Head count is correct.
All men accounted for on bus three.

395
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,828
I want confirmed head counts
on all other vehicles.

396
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:34,070
<i>(man) Copy that. Bus one confirmed.</i>

397
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,151
Roger that.

398
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:41,279
We will proceed single file
in an orderly manner onto the plane.

399
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:45,797
There will be no mistakes and no disorder.
Is that clear?

400
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:53,150
Let's get these buses
out of here as soon as we can.

401
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,516
- Let's move.
- Yes, sir.

402
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:20,757
Fayed, we just heard from the airport.
Our people are being loaded onto the planes.

403
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,831
The president has given in to us.

404
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,356
Hello?

405
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:08,955
Hello?

406
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,837
<i>(man) Back here.</i>

407
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,358
- You Marcus?
- Who are you?

408
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:21,559
I'm supposed to give this to you and you're
supposed to give me something in return.

409
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,836
It's not enough.

410
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,115
What do you mean?

411
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:48,034
The component cost me more than
I thought it would. I need another 50,000.

412
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:51,954
- But that's all he gave me.
- Well, then go back and get the rest.

413
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:54,315
I can't do that.

414
00:35:56,360 --> 00:36:00,319
Look, I need whatever it is
you're selling, please.

415
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,915
Just take the money. I am begging you.

416
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,319
Hey.

417
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:09,598
Until you get more money,
we have nothing more to talk about.

418
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,035
- C-can I use your phone?
- Yeah.

419
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:28,877
<i>- (phone rings)
- Hello.</i>

420
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:34,270
- He, um, wants another $50,000.
- Tell him you don't have it.

421
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:37,989
I did and he said to come back when I get it.

422
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:43,473
There is no more money. I don't care what
you have to do, but get that item from him.

423
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:46,120
You understand what happens here
if you don't?

424
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,719
<i>(clears throat) Yeah.</i>

425
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,870
I understand.

426
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:57,513
- What'd he say?
- He says he'll get the money.

427
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:02,151
And before I bring it back here, he just
wants to make sure you really do have it.

428
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,792
There it is.

429
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,872
You son of a bitch!

430
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,508
I'll kill you!

431
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:40,956
Shut up, just take the money!
Just take it.

432
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,551
The hard drive is mostly toast, but I was able
to recover the most recently accessed file.

433
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:16,393
Some kind of wiring schematic.
How much do we have?

434
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:20,268
About a page and a half.
Mostly in Arabic, some of it in Russian.

435
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,510
Get Assad over here now.

436
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,918
Boorman, bring him.

437
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:35,229
Do you know what this is?

438
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:40,076
A list of electronic components,
build specifications,

439
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,833
programming instructions for a detonator.

440
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:48,358
But this is for a nuclear device.

441
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:52,872
Is it possible Fayed
could've acquired a nuclear weapon?

442
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,872
His organisation has tried
unsuccessfully in the past.

443
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:58,110
- He may have found a way.
- Son of a bitch!

444
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:03,558
- You knew about this all along, didn't you?
- Curtis! Curtis! Let go of him now!

445
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,992
Assad, please.

446
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:11,758
There is a reference file
at the bottom of the page. Sovtel Three.

447
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:15,389
That's a compact bomb the Soviets made
till the late '80s - a suitcase nuke.

448
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,596
- They're all accounted for?
- Destroyed.

449
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:22,390
There was a claim a device was diverted to a
nuclear scientist with suspected terrorist ties.

450
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,948
- Calls himself Saif al Din.
- Looking up his file.

451
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:28,396
There won't be much. It's a code name,
means "sword of the faith".

452
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:33,235
- Intelligence never discovered his identity.
- We have a six-year-old surveillance photo.

453
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,673
Put it up.

454
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:41,996
- Do you recognise him?
- Yes. I saw him with Fayed a year ago.

455
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,878
- His name is Hasan Numair.
- Chloe, did you copy that?

456
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:49,317
- Looking up his name.
- We need to know where this man is now.

457
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:54,713
I think we already do. He's a terrorist being
released from the Palmdale military prison.

458
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,712
Call the White House.
Bring up the feed from the airfield.

459
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:00,712
This is what Fayed
has been planning all along.

460
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:04,429
These bombings were designed
to make you free this man.

461
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:06,431
Son of a bitch.

462
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:10,798
- Have they freed the prisoners?
- It'll be a couple minutes till they're in the air.

463
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:15,954
Call the airfield. Send it to my office.
Tell the president I'm stopping the release.

464
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:20,909
This is Nadia Yassir from CTU. I need
to speak to the president, priority three.

465
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:29,477
<i>This is Buchanan. The prisoner you want
is Hasan Numair. I'll send his picture.</i>

466
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,710
Roger that. Let's move it, boys.

467
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,913
Prisoner Numair, raise your hand.

468
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:46,508
<i>- I've got the photo.
- Copy that.</i>

469
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:53,638
Prisoner Numair, identify yourself now.

470
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,797
We need to go over every square inch.

471
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,440
Someone tell the sarge
he needs to get up here now.

472
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,795
<i>(gunshot)</i>

473
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:09,920
Hurry up. Fayed is waiting for you.

474
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:10,191
