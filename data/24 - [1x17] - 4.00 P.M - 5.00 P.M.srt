1
00:00:13,293 --> 00:00:18,606
Right now, terrorists are plotting
to assassinate a presidential candidate.

2
00:00:18,693 --> 00:00:21,048
My wife and daughter have been targeted.

3
00:00:21,133 --> 00:00:25,126
And people that I work with
may be involved in both.

4
00:00:25,213 --> 00:00:30,845
I'm Federal Agent Jack Bauer,
and today is the longest day of my life.

5
00:00:34,933 --> 00:00:38,448
- Hello?
- We're not leaving town today after all.

6
00:00:38,533 --> 00:00:42,321
- When will you know?
- I'll call you as soon as I know.

7
00:00:42,613 --> 00:00:44,604
- Is that the girl?
- Yes.

8
00:00:45,613 --> 00:00:49,652
The threat against Senator Palmer
remains a high probability.

9
00:00:49,733 --> 00:00:52,930
These three men are the suspected shooters.

10
00:00:53,013 --> 00:00:58,326
A member of my advance team, Elizabeth
Nash, she recognised one of the assassins.

11
00:00:58,693 --> 00:01:01,685
Mr. Bauer,
Senator Palmer told me about you.

12
00:01:01,773 --> 00:01:04,333
Would you be willing
to keep your appointment?

13
00:01:04,413 --> 00:01:06,005
You want me to spy on him?

14
00:01:06,093 --> 00:01:10,006
- George, what are you doin' here?
- I'm the new quarterback.

15
00:01:10,253 --> 00:01:12,813
Bauer's wife and daughter
are in a safe house.

16
00:01:12,893 --> 00:01:15,123
As planned, they will be dead soon.

17
00:01:15,213 --> 00:01:17,204
Hang on, Kim!

18
00:01:22,053 --> 00:01:26,205
I think we lost him. I'm just gonna go check.
I want you to stay right here, OK?

19
00:01:30,693 --> 00:01:33,446
Kim!

20
00:01:38,453 --> 00:01:40,523
What's your name?

21
00:01:40,613 --> 00:01:42,251
I don't remember.

22
00:02:04,933 --> 00:02:06,924
Mom!

23
00:02:29,813 --> 00:02:31,804
Mom!

24
00:02:34,853 --> 00:02:36,844
Mom!

25
00:02:39,973 --> 00:02:43,045
Do you remember anything yet?

26
00:02:43,133 --> 00:02:44,122
No.

27
00:02:45,973 --> 00:02:48,203
It must be weird.

28
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:52,286
I mean, I never met anyone
that has amnesia before.

29
00:02:54,973 --> 00:02:57,612
I really appreciate you helping me out.

30
00:03:05,693 --> 00:03:08,366
- What's your name?
- Tanya.

31
00:03:09,213 --> 00:03:11,204
Tanya.

32
00:03:12,253 --> 00:03:14,608
I hope you're not going
too far out of your way.

33
00:03:14,693 --> 00:03:18,652
It's fine. The hospital isn't far from here.

34
00:03:21,013 --> 00:03:24,164
So, you come from money.
You look like you might.

35
00:03:24,253 --> 00:03:26,562
Or your husband.

36
00:03:26,653 --> 00:03:29,213
- My husband?
- Your little band of gold?

37
00:03:29,293 --> 00:03:31,284
On your finger?

38
00:03:35,093 --> 00:03:38,085
I don't have any memory of my husband.

39
00:03:54,213 --> 00:03:57,649
Agent Pierce, Jack Bauer.
We met at the breakfast this morning.

40
00:03:57,733 --> 00:04:01,806
I'm sorry about that. We didn't know the
pressure you were under. Is your family OK?

41
00:04:01,893 --> 00:04:05,522
Yes, they're fine, thank you.
This is my partner, Nina Myers.

42
00:04:05,613 --> 00:04:08,605
Agents Johnson, Aleshire,
surveillance technicians.

43
00:04:08,693 --> 00:04:11,969
You've met Miss Nash.
She's part of the senator's advance team.

44
00:04:12,053 --> 00:04:14,044
Yes, from the senator's staff meeting.

45
00:04:14,133 --> 00:04:17,091
Can I just say how sorry I am
to have caused so much trouble?

46
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:20,245
You didn't know who Drazen was.
Now you know he's a killer,

47
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:24,451
- it takes courage to walk into the same room.
- I hate to interrupt, but we have to go.

48
00:04:24,533 --> 00:04:29,368
Drazen is down here in room 1243.
We went over it. It's nothing unusual.

49
00:04:29,453 --> 00:04:31,444
It's ready to rig however you want to.

50
00:04:31,533 --> 00:04:34,491
That gives us less than 30 minutes
to set up visual and audio.

51
00:04:34,573 --> 00:04:36,165
- Fiber optics?
- Yes.

52
00:04:36,253 --> 00:04:38,847
We also need to set up monitors
in an adjacent room.

53
00:04:38,933 --> 00:04:42,482
We have 1242, across the hallway.
It's been vacated already.

54
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:45,406
OK, good. Gentlemen,
I want you to get started right away.

55
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:49,008
I want coverage of every square foot
of this room by at least two angles.

56
00:04:49,093 --> 00:04:51,084
- Nina?
- Yeah?

57
00:04:52,293 --> 00:04:56,081
Take Miss Nash into 1242.
Start prepping her. We'll be there in a minute.

58
00:04:56,173 --> 00:05:00,451
- Have you set up the other checkpoints?
- Every entrance to the hotel is covered.

59
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:02,842
So is every approach from a block away.

60
00:05:02,933 --> 00:05:06,323
- Any civilians left on the floor?
- No, we've sealed it off.

61
00:05:06,413 --> 00:05:10,122
Good work. Let me know
as soon as Drazen enters this hotel.

62
00:05:19,893 --> 00:05:25,251
I think there's a hospital at the bottom
of the canyon. I'm not sure how good it is.

63
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:27,688
Wait, wait. Pull over.

64
00:05:27,773 --> 00:05:30,162
- You see something you remember?
- Yeah, I think so.

65
00:05:30,253 --> 00:05:32,244
- The restaurant?
- Yeah.

66
00:06:01,813 --> 00:06:05,567
- Do you recognise anything?
- I've been here before.

67
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:08,883
I was with someone.

68
00:06:08,973 --> 00:06:10,964
With your husband?

69
00:06:12,453 --> 00:06:14,444
Not your husband?

70
00:06:15,573 --> 00:06:17,882
Maybe we should keep going, to the hospital.

71
00:06:17,973 --> 00:06:20,441
No, no, no. Just being here helps.

72
00:06:21,893 --> 00:06:24,566
Hey, is there a maître d'
or a manager or something?

73
00:06:24,653 --> 00:06:27,406
- Manager. Mr. Martin.
- Is he here?

74
00:06:27,493 --> 00:06:29,882
No, but he should be in about 20 minutes.

75
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:31,964
Thank you. I'm gonna wait.

76
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:55,803
Maybe this Mr. Martin
knows something about me.

77
00:06:57,813 --> 00:07:00,202
This place seems so familiar.

78
00:07:07,173 --> 00:07:10,324
I think I'm gonna stay.
You don't have to wait with me.

79
00:07:10,973 --> 00:07:13,931
So, listen. Why don't you
give me your number, and...

80
00:07:14,013 --> 00:07:18,211
when I'm better,
I'll send you whatever I can afford.

81
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:22,564
You know what?

82
00:07:24,133 --> 00:07:27,330
Send me whatever you can afford,
plus ten bucks.

83
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:32,366
It's a cab fare to the hospital,

84
00:07:33,013 --> 00:07:35,607
in case Mr. Martin can't help you.

85
00:07:37,173 --> 00:07:39,767
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

86
00:07:54,893 --> 00:07:57,612
So, obviously,
without compromising yourself,

87
00:07:57,693 --> 00:08:00,810
we need you to behave in the same way
you always have with him.

88
00:08:00,893 --> 00:08:04,647
I know. It's just the thought
of letting him touch me again...

89
00:08:05,813 --> 00:08:07,769
I understand.

90
00:08:07,853 --> 00:08:11,482
What do you usually
talk about with him? His work?

91
00:08:11,573 --> 00:08:15,361
The truth is, we didn't really talk much.
It wasn't that kind of relationship.

92
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:19,412
It was more... take the plunge
and worry about the consequences later.

93
00:08:19,493 --> 00:08:22,246
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah.

94
00:08:22,933 --> 00:08:26,562
- OK, I'm waiting on the signal.
- Elizabeth?

95
00:08:26,653 --> 00:08:28,450
- Hi.
- I heard what's going on.

96
00:08:28,533 --> 00:08:31,127
- Are you sure about this?
- I'm sure.

97
00:08:31,213 --> 00:08:35,764
- If you have the slightest hesitation...
- No, I want to. Definitely.

98
00:08:39,813 --> 00:08:42,043
- May I talk to you a minute?
- Yes, sir.

99
00:08:47,493 --> 00:08:49,927
I told you to look after her,
not put her in danger.

100
00:08:50,013 --> 00:08:54,052
Senator, I don't need to remind you,
but the threat against you is very real.

101
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:57,409
- It's no reason to put someone else at risk.
- I don't think I have.

102
00:08:57,493 --> 00:09:01,611
I'll be across the hall with a squad of men,
ready to come in if something goes wrong.

103
00:09:01,693 --> 00:09:04,287
He's a professional killer.
Things can happen fast.

104
00:09:04,373 --> 00:09:07,570
He is not working alone.
Arresting him will not stop the others.

105
00:09:07,653 --> 00:09:11,851
If you want to put an end to this now,
sir, we keep him on the hook.

106
00:09:14,253 --> 00:09:17,928
I know you've been through a lot,
and your family has gone through hell...

107
00:09:18,013 --> 00:09:20,527
What does that have to do with this?

108
00:09:20,613 --> 00:09:24,845
I hope you're not letting a desire
for payback cloud your judgment.

109
00:09:26,413 --> 00:09:29,610
Sir, this has nothing to do with payback.

110
00:09:29,693 --> 00:09:33,686
This is simply the best way
to nail these guys, period.

111
00:09:36,733 --> 00:09:41,807
Elizabeth's father is one of my oldest friends.
I have known her since she was born.

112
00:09:41,893 --> 00:09:46,409
If anything happens to her,
I'm holding you personally responsible.

113
00:09:46,493 --> 00:09:51,362
I understand, Senator,
and I promise you I will take care of her.

114
00:10:58,093 --> 00:10:59,162
CTU. Almeida.

115
00:11:01,133 --> 00:11:04,682
- Hi. I'd like to speak to Jack Bauer.
- He's not here. Can I take a message?

116
00:11:05,053 --> 00:11:08,648
Listen, it's really important.
I need to speak to him now.

117
00:11:08,733 --> 00:11:10,963
- Who is this?
- Kim, his daughter.

118
00:11:11,053 --> 00:11:14,807
- Are you calling from the safe house?
- No. The safe house has been attacked.

119
00:11:14,893 --> 00:11:19,011
The agents that were guarding us
are dead, and my mother is gone.

120
00:11:19,093 --> 00:11:22,165
Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down.
The agents are dead?

121
00:11:22,253 --> 00:11:25,689
Yes. And I think they've kidnapped
my mother again.

122
00:11:25,773 --> 00:11:28,651
- I need to speak to my father.
- He's not here, Kim.

123
00:11:28,733 --> 00:11:31,850
- Where are you calling from?
- Um...

124
00:11:31,933 --> 00:11:35,209
- Can I speak to Nina Myers?
- She's not here either.

125
00:11:35,293 --> 00:11:38,410
- Where are you calling from?
- A payphone.

126
00:11:38,493 --> 00:11:40,768
- Kim?
- Who did you say this was again?

127
00:11:40,853 --> 00:11:42,844
Tony Almeida. I work for your father.

128
00:11:42,933 --> 00:11:46,608
Tell me where you are.
I'll have somebody come get you.

129
00:11:49,933 --> 00:11:51,525
Kim?

130
00:11:52,413 --> 00:11:56,122
- That's what they said to my mother.
- That was Jamey Farrell. She was dirty.

131
00:11:56,213 --> 00:11:59,250
That won't happen again.
Where are you? I'll have somebody...

132
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:02,882
Listen to me.
I need to speak to my father or Nina Myers.

133
00:12:02,973 --> 00:12:06,249
He's not here, Kim.
Neither one of them are here.

134
00:12:06,693 --> 00:12:08,285
Kim? Hello?

135
00:12:12,253 --> 00:12:17,043
We got a problem. Jack's daughter says the
safe house has been hit. The agents are dead.

136
00:12:17,133 --> 00:12:19,124
Call over there right now.

137
00:12:22,973 --> 00:12:25,533
Nothing. It's not even ringing.

138
00:12:25,613 --> 00:12:29,083
Parker, get Biselli and head over
to the safe house on Pine Canyon.

139
00:12:29,173 --> 00:12:31,767
Heads up - could be trouble.
Call me when you get there.

140
00:12:31,853 --> 00:12:34,811
She also said that her mother
might have been recaptured.

141
00:12:34,893 --> 00:12:36,645
- How'd Kim get out?
- She didn't say.

142
00:12:36,733 --> 00:12:39,008
She just said she was calling on a payphone.

143
00:12:39,093 --> 00:12:42,403
Access the phone company's computer
for all recent payphone calls

144
00:12:42,493 --> 00:12:45,485
- within five miles of the safe house.
- All right.

145
00:12:45,573 --> 00:12:49,361
- Are you gonna call Jack or you want me to?
- Not yet.

146
00:12:49,453 --> 00:12:52,047
- It's his wife and kid.
- That's exactly why.

147
00:12:52,133 --> 00:12:55,284
He'll get emotional and distracted,
put Elizabeth in jeopardy.

148
00:12:55,373 --> 00:12:59,252
She's going in with Drazen in 15 minutes.
We need to keep Jack focused.

149
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:01,688
- Then when do we tell him?
- We don't. I do.

150
00:13:01,773 --> 00:13:05,561
When the situation's under control,
and not until. Clear?

151
00:13:07,853 --> 00:13:09,764
- Thanks.
- Standing by.

152
00:13:09,853 --> 00:13:11,366
Copy. He's on his way down.

153
00:13:11,453 --> 00:13:13,171
- Are you finished?
- Ready in ten.

154
00:13:13,253 --> 00:13:17,405
- How's Elizabeth doing?
- She says she's OK, but, Jack, I don't know.

155
00:13:17,493 --> 00:13:20,644
- Sure we're doing the right thing?
- If she can plant the device,

156
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:22,963
it'll lead us to everything else. Yes, we are.

157
00:13:23,053 --> 00:13:25,613
- If she can't?
- We'll arrest him, try and turn him.

158
00:13:25,693 --> 00:13:27,763
He can't touch her. We can protect her.

159
00:13:27,853 --> 00:13:30,731
- I hope so.
- Stay focused and we can.

160
00:13:30,813 --> 00:13:32,769
- Hey!
- What?

161
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:34,844
Are you all right?

162
00:13:36,173 --> 00:13:38,164
I'm sorry.

163
00:13:43,373 --> 00:13:48,242
I just can't stop worrying about Teri and Kim.
When I think what they've been through...

164
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:53,487
- My little girl thought she was gonna die.
- Hey, Jack. We're gonna get them, OK?

165
00:13:53,573 --> 00:13:58,044
Look, if it's any help, from what I could tell,
Teri and Kim seemed all right.

166
00:13:58,133 --> 00:13:59,930
- Really?
- Yeah.

167
00:14:00,613 --> 00:14:04,811
- What did the doctor say?
- Just some bruises. That's it.

168
00:14:06,013 --> 00:14:07,446
OK. Thanks.

169
00:14:07,533 --> 00:14:09,524
- OK?
- Yeah.

170
00:14:12,213 --> 00:14:14,363
- Nina?
- Yeah?

171
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:17,365
You said that Paulson
was gonna finish the debrief?

172
00:14:17,453 --> 00:14:20,445
- Yeah.
- Why didn't you stay and finish it?

173
00:14:20,533 --> 00:14:23,172
I thought you wanted me back
as soon as they were safe.

174
00:14:23,253 --> 00:14:25,562
No, I specifically asked you
to stay with them...

175
00:14:25,653 --> 00:14:28,645
- Hey, Nina!
- Yeah, Mike, just a minute.

176
00:14:30,213 --> 00:14:33,011
- Go back. I will be there in a minute.
- Yeah?

177
00:14:59,573 --> 00:15:02,041
I told you to take it off the hook!

178
00:15:08,453 --> 00:15:10,125
- Yeah?
- Rick, it's me.

179
00:15:10,213 --> 00:15:12,443
Kim, I told you you can't keep calling here.

180
00:15:12,533 --> 00:15:17,561
Look, the safe house was bad. The agents
are dead and my mother is kidnapped again.

181
00:15:17,653 --> 00:15:20,406
I know they're after me. You need to help me.

182
00:15:20,493 --> 00:15:22,768
- Listen, I'm coming to your place.
- No!

183
00:15:22,853 --> 00:15:26,368
You're the only person who knows
the people that have my mother.

184
00:15:26,453 --> 00:15:28,569
- I don't! I...
- Rick...

185
00:15:28,653 --> 00:15:32,931
I can't go to the police. I don't trust them.
After today, I don't trust anyone.

186
00:15:33,013 --> 00:15:38,007
But if you don't help me right now,
I will tell the police everything.

187
00:15:39,733 --> 00:15:42,247
Now, what is your address?

188
00:15:46,373 --> 00:15:49,490
1804 Glade, in Echo Park.

189
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:53,885
1804 Glade, in Echo Park.
OK, I'm gonna call a taxi right now.

190
00:15:53,973 --> 00:15:58,364
I'm gonna meet you there
as soon as I can. Wait for me.

191
00:16:03,093 --> 00:16:04,811
Who was that?

192
00:16:09,213 --> 00:16:11,204
Another wrong number?

193
00:16:31,533 --> 00:16:33,888
How's the election going?

194
00:16:34,973 --> 00:16:38,170
- Exit polls look very good.
- That's great.

195
00:16:43,373 --> 00:16:45,443
Dad, I'm sorry.

196
00:16:45,533 --> 00:16:47,728
Sorry about what?

197
00:16:49,813 --> 00:16:54,887
You weren't covering up Ferragamo's death
to protect your campaign.

198
00:16:55,253 --> 00:16:57,244
You did it to protect me.

199
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:01,927
Where'd you hear that? Your mom?

200
00:17:02,893 --> 00:17:04,884
No, not Mom.

201
00:17:09,693 --> 00:17:13,368
There is some physical evidence
in George Ferragamo's office

202
00:17:13,453 --> 00:17:16,206
that leads directly to you.

203
00:17:16,293 --> 00:17:19,603
Subtle enough so the fire marshals
didn't find it the first time.

204
00:17:19,693 --> 00:17:22,685
But with a little help, they'll find it.

205
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:28,963
- So I'll be framed for Ferragamo's murder?
- Like I said, whatever it takes.

206
00:17:29,053 --> 00:17:32,841
That's why your father backed off,
and that's why youll back off.

207
00:17:40,613 --> 00:17:44,845
Do you know how dangerous it was
to go see Carl wearing a wire?

208
00:17:45,733 --> 00:17:49,442
Look, it doesn't matter. I got it.
Now you can take it to the police.

209
00:17:52,573 --> 00:17:54,962
Give me the tape.

210
00:17:56,413 --> 00:17:58,608
What are you gonna do with it?

211
00:18:01,133 --> 00:18:03,522
Do you trust me, Keith?

212
00:18:29,973 --> 00:18:34,967
It's me. There's been a development.
Palmer is staying in Los Angeles after all.

213
00:18:35,053 --> 00:18:40,491
- The Nash girl called you?
- Yes. I'm on my way to the hotel now.

214
00:18:40,573 --> 00:18:43,292
Did she say why
the senator changed his plans?

215
00:18:43,373 --> 00:18:48,242
- No, he didn't tell her.
- Really? She's a highly placed aide.

216
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:53,088
Well, they've tightened security
since the attempt on his life at breakfast.

217
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:57,325
I wonder that she wants to see you again
so quickly. You were with her two hours ago.

218
00:18:57,413 --> 00:18:59,483
You don't understand women, Andre.

219
00:18:59,573 --> 00:19:04,249
I understand them well enough to know
that they can use as well as be used.

220
00:19:04,933 --> 00:19:08,528
- Not this one.
- Palmer should have been killed hours ago.

221
00:19:08,613 --> 00:19:11,650
We can't afford any more mistakes.
We're running out of time.

222
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:15,806
He's as good as dead already.
You have to trust me in this.

223
00:19:15,893 --> 00:19:19,727
The Nash woman will tell me Palmer's
schedule. She doesn't suspect a thing.

224
00:19:19,813 --> 00:19:21,804
Maybe not.

225
00:19:23,613 --> 00:19:27,401
Just to be safe,
when you're finished... kill her.

226
00:19:37,613 --> 00:19:39,808
Miss Nash, please follow me.

227
00:19:42,533 --> 00:19:47,368
We've been planting fibre-optic cameras
here, there and all through here as well.

228
00:19:47,453 --> 00:19:50,331
I'm not really sure what those are.

229
00:19:50,413 --> 00:19:52,608
I'm sorry. Please, sit down.

230
00:19:56,853 --> 00:19:58,923
Fibre-optic cameras are tiny cameras.

231
00:19:59,013 --> 00:20:02,323
They're almost impossible to see,
even if you know where to look.

232
00:20:02,413 --> 00:20:06,486
So when you come into the room,
we'll have visual coverage of the entire suite.

233
00:20:06,573 --> 00:20:10,612
- And you'll be able to hear everything too?
- Yes, every word.

234
00:20:10,693 --> 00:20:12,490
- You all right?
- Mm.

235
00:20:12,573 --> 00:20:15,724
OK, now, he's gonna
be here in a few minutes.

236
00:20:15,813 --> 00:20:18,964
This is the tracking device
that we want you to plant on Alexis.

237
00:20:19,053 --> 00:20:22,762
Once he leaves the hotel, we'll be able
to track every move that he makes

238
00:20:22,853 --> 00:20:24,844
without exposing ourselves at all.

239
00:20:24,933 --> 00:20:27,208
- Where do I put it?
- Preferably his wallet.

240
00:20:27,293 --> 00:20:30,205
He'll have it on him at all times,
even if he changes clothes.

241
00:20:30,293 --> 00:20:33,490
As soon as you plant this device,
I'll call you on your cellphone.

242
00:20:33,573 --> 00:20:39,125
I will tell you the senator is waiting for you.
You make your excuses, and you get out.

243
00:20:39,213 --> 00:20:43,729
- So I plant the tracker, the phone rings...
- And then you'll leave.

244
00:20:43,813 --> 00:20:45,963
- OK.
- One more thing.

245
00:20:46,053 --> 00:20:49,841
If at any point you think he's suspicious
or you're uncomfortable in any way,

246
00:20:49,933 --> 00:20:53,767
all you have to do is utter the words
"I hope I'm not getting a cold. "

247
00:20:53,853 --> 00:20:56,413
- "I hope I'm not getting a cold"?
- Yes.

248
00:20:56,493 --> 00:21:00,281
Then I'll be in this room in a few seconds
with half a dozen other agents.

249
00:21:00,373 --> 00:21:03,126
- But that would ruin the plan.
- That doesn't matter.

250
00:21:03,213 --> 00:21:08,412
Right now all we're concerned with
is your safety. Do you understand that?

251
00:21:08,493 --> 00:21:09,721
I understand.

252
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:16,570
You don't have to do this.

253
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:21,766
If you're uncomfortable in any way,
no one here will think any less of you.

254
00:21:21,853 --> 00:21:23,650
I'm fine.

255
00:21:24,493 --> 00:21:26,449
And thank you.

256
00:21:27,093 --> 00:21:30,210
For giving me this chance to redeem myself.

257
00:21:38,573 --> 00:21:40,450
You're going to be fine.

258
00:21:41,853 --> 00:21:43,411
Let's go.

259
00:21:46,453 --> 00:21:48,489
Mrs. Bauer?

260
00:21:48,573 --> 00:21:50,564
How good to see you.

261
00:21:52,373 --> 00:21:56,764
- You know me?
- Of course. Will Dr Parslow be joining you?

262
00:21:56,853 --> 00:21:58,844
Dr Parslow?

263
00:21:59,653 --> 00:22:01,405
I'm sorry. What's your name?

264
00:22:02,013 --> 00:22:04,766
Mrs. Bauer, are you feeling all right?

265
00:22:04,853 --> 00:22:07,048
Actually, no, I, uh...

266
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:11,642
I must have been in
an accident or something. I...

267
00:22:12,813 --> 00:22:15,008
I seem to have lost my memory.

268
00:22:15,093 --> 00:22:19,325
But I was driving by
and this place looked familiar, so...

269
00:22:19,413 --> 00:22:21,643
You say my name is Bauer?

270
00:22:21,733 --> 00:22:24,930
Yes. Does that sound familiar?

271
00:22:26,533 --> 00:22:28,922
Yes, it does, but...

272
00:22:29,013 --> 00:22:33,211
- But this man you mentioned...
- Dr Parslow.

273
00:22:33,293 --> 00:22:36,763
You two used to come in here
together quite often.

274
00:22:39,053 --> 00:22:41,009
But... he's not my husband.

275
00:22:41,093 --> 00:22:46,531
Well... he's a doctor, and he's a friend.
Maybe he can help.

276
00:22:47,453 --> 00:22:52,288
I happen to know the hospital that
he works at. Shall I give him a call?

277
00:22:52,373 --> 00:22:54,364
Yes, please.

278
00:23:01,853 --> 00:23:03,844
We're set.

279
00:23:10,733 --> 00:23:13,327
- Is everything up and running?
- Yep.

280
00:23:15,893 --> 00:23:19,522
- How's Elizabeth?
- She's in her room, waiting for Alexis to call.

281
00:23:19,613 --> 00:23:22,411
- She said she wanted to be alone.
- Understandable.

282
00:23:22,493 --> 00:23:24,245
Yes.

283
00:23:43,253 --> 00:23:47,610
- You wanna tell me what's going on?
- What do you mean?

284
00:23:47,693 --> 00:23:52,130
You've been holding something back ever
since you got back from the safe house early.

285
00:23:52,213 --> 00:23:54,522
This isn't the time. Let's not get distracted.

286
00:23:54,613 --> 00:24:00,085
If you don't start telling me what's going on,
I'm going to be distracted, so spit it out.

287
00:24:02,053 --> 00:24:03,850
All right.

288
00:24:04,773 --> 00:24:06,411
Teri knows about us.

289
00:24:09,693 --> 00:24:13,049
She guessed it.
I don't know how she did, but she did.

290
00:24:13,133 --> 00:24:17,092
She asked me point-blank.
I couldn't deny it. She would have known.

291
00:24:20,693 --> 00:24:23,685
Did you tell her that it was over?

292
00:24:23,773 --> 00:24:25,968
Of course I did.

293
00:24:28,853 --> 00:24:31,845
I think she was just shocked that it was me.

294
00:24:33,573 --> 00:24:35,564
Someone she knows.

295
00:24:47,253 --> 00:24:49,847
When Teri and I got back together...

296
00:24:52,413 --> 00:24:55,211
I tried to talk to her about this, but...

297
00:24:56,213 --> 00:24:59,285
she said she didn't wanna know,
so I just let it go.

298
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:03,365
Look, Jack. You asked me
to go to the safe house, so I did.

299
00:25:03,453 --> 00:25:07,446
- I was just trying to help.
- I know, I know. This is my fault.

300
00:25:07,533 --> 00:25:11,526
- This is all my fault.
- Agent Bauer, come in.

301
00:25:14,093 --> 00:25:15,492
- Bauer.
- We're a go.

302
00:25:15,573 --> 00:25:19,566
Drazen just dropped off the car with the valet.
Should be upstairs in two minutes.

303
00:25:19,653 --> 00:25:25,410
Copy. All personnel in the lobby
and on the floors, we are a go. We're a go.

304
00:25:42,173 --> 00:25:43,845
He's in the room.

305
00:25:43,933 --> 00:25:47,164
Copy that.
Advise when you are green to go.

306
00:25:53,053 --> 00:25:54,327
There's no wallet here.

307
00:25:54,413 --> 00:26:00,363
Let Elizabeth Nash know that the wallet is
either in his pants, or the jacket on the bed.

308
00:26:00,453 --> 00:26:02,171
Copy that, Jack.

309
00:26:11,253 --> 00:26:15,132
Send her up in one minute.
One minute.

310
00:27:10,453 --> 00:27:11,408
Hi.

311
00:27:21,893 --> 00:27:24,088
- So good to see you.
- Yeah.

312
00:27:32,813 --> 00:27:35,452
I can't believe how much I've missed you.

313
00:27:35,533 --> 00:27:37,524
I know. Me too.

314
00:27:38,293 --> 00:27:41,683
Even though it's only been two hours.

315
00:27:41,773 --> 00:27:43,764
It seems like two years.

316
00:27:49,533 --> 00:27:51,808
Are you OK?

317
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:53,686
I'm fine. Why?

318
00:27:53,773 --> 00:27:56,970
- You seem a little... tense.
- No, not at all.

319
00:27:57,813 --> 00:28:01,010
Well... maybe a little.

320
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:06,848
The polls back east close in less than an hour
and we're all just on pins and needles.

321
00:28:06,933 --> 00:28:09,128
Mm...

322
00:28:11,653 --> 00:28:15,362
Well, you must have some idea
about the outcome. Don't you take, uh...

323
00:28:15,453 --> 00:28:17,409
- Exit polls.
- Yes.

324
00:28:17,493 --> 00:28:19,484
But they're not official.

325
00:28:22,293 --> 00:28:23,931
What can we do

326
00:28:24,013 --> 00:28:28,882
to help you... relax?

327
00:28:30,293 --> 00:28:34,889
Well, it's a little early, but...
a vodka might be nice.

328
00:28:37,613 --> 00:28:39,331
Nothing else?

329
00:28:40,213 --> 00:28:42,204
If you insist.

330
00:29:10,213 --> 00:29:12,886
- You feeling any better?
- Much.

331
00:29:15,613 --> 00:29:18,571
You still don't seem like yourself.

332
00:29:18,653 --> 00:29:22,851
I'll feel better after I've splashed
some water on my face.

333
00:29:28,453 --> 00:29:35,131
She's going for the jacket. I want SWAT
personnel ready at the door. Quietly.

334
00:29:36,893 --> 00:29:38,246
She's got the wallet.

335
00:29:42,773 --> 00:29:44,968
Oh, God, Jack, she's dropped it.

336
00:29:52,093 --> 00:29:56,484
Come on. Come on, Elizabeth. You can do it.

337
00:30:02,053 --> 00:30:04,726
- To the future.
- She's put it in her coat.

338
00:30:04,813 --> 00:30:08,806
SWAT team at the door, stand down.
Stand down at the door.

339
00:30:19,053 --> 00:30:23,285
I'm sorry that this campaign
is giving you so much stress.

340
00:30:25,253 --> 00:30:27,244
Goes with the territory.

341
00:30:27,773 --> 00:30:33,245
Maybe when the election is over,
the two of us can go somewhere together.

342
00:30:35,413 --> 00:30:37,927
- Like where?
- It doesn't matter to me.

343
00:30:40,533 --> 00:30:42,364
As long as we're together.

344
00:30:44,853 --> 00:30:46,252
So...

345
00:30:47,413 --> 00:30:49,643
who do I have to thank
for keeping you in town?

346
00:30:49,733 --> 00:30:53,089
- He's gonna feel the wallet.
- Just give her a second.

347
00:30:53,493 --> 00:30:55,085
She's all right.

348
00:30:56,173 --> 00:30:59,051
What made the senator
decide to change his plans?

349
00:30:59,133 --> 00:31:01,124
I don't know.

350
00:31:03,213 --> 00:31:05,408
Is he gonna stay in town for long?

351
00:31:05,933 --> 00:31:07,924
It's hard to say.

352
00:31:09,333 --> 00:31:12,848
What about his... victory speech?

353
00:31:13,533 --> 00:31:16,366
Will he be delivering it here at the hotel?

354
00:31:16,453 --> 00:31:20,241
Why are you so interested in
the campaign all of a sudden?

355
00:31:20,333 --> 00:31:22,927
I have no interest in the campaign.

356
00:31:24,653 --> 00:31:26,848
My interest is in you.

357
00:31:27,933 --> 00:31:30,731
And I know that you go wherever he goes.

358
00:31:30,813 --> 00:31:33,850
Well, I don't know where that is yet.

359
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:37,642
Well, then I won't let you out of my sight.

360
00:31:38,173 --> 00:31:41,722
I must say, I do find it a little strange
that the senator wouldn't

361
00:31:41,813 --> 00:31:44,725
include someone
as smart and capable as you

362
00:31:44,813 --> 00:31:48,647
- in his inner circle.
- How would you know how smart I am?

363
00:31:48,733 --> 00:31:52,885
We've spent maybe 15 hours together,
and most of that has been in bed.

364
00:31:53,253 --> 00:31:55,403
That wasn't smart.

365
00:31:56,813 --> 00:32:01,603
Was that... a complaint or a compliment?

366
00:32:05,853 --> 00:32:08,128
Both, I think.

367
00:32:12,813 --> 00:32:16,169
I just realised that I haven't eaten all day,

368
00:32:17,653 --> 00:32:21,328
which may explain why
I'm in such a foul mood.

369
00:32:23,053 --> 00:32:25,931
Do you think we could order something up?

370
00:32:26,013 --> 00:32:28,288
What are you hungry for?

371
00:32:28,373 --> 00:32:30,364
Where's the menu?

372
00:32:35,773 --> 00:32:38,287
I was hoping you would be
hungry for something...

373
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:41,331
- There you go. Good girl.
... other than food.

374
00:32:51,093 --> 00:32:53,653
- It's in the jacket.
- She made the plant.

375
00:32:54,413 --> 00:32:57,405
Clear the hallway. Copy. Clear the hallway.

376
00:33:05,773 --> 00:33:08,571
I know this might seem a little soon...

377
00:33:16,893 --> 00:33:18,770
I've fallen in love with you.

378
00:33:23,933 --> 00:33:27,403
- The hallway's clear.
- Copy. I'm making the call.

379
00:33:34,733 --> 00:33:37,406
I thought that all women
can sense these things.

380
00:33:46,573 --> 00:33:48,768
Pick up the phone!

381
00:33:50,053 --> 00:33:53,443
- Aren't you going to answer it?
- It's just someone from the campaign.

382
00:33:53,533 --> 00:33:57,048
- No, it could be important.
- They can call back.

383
00:34:07,653 --> 00:34:09,132
Say it again, Alexis.

384
00:34:10,053 --> 00:34:12,521
- She hung up on me!
- Say that you love me.

385
00:34:12,613 --> 00:34:14,922
- What is she doing?
- She's baiting him.

386
00:34:15,613 --> 00:34:17,604
I love you.

387
00:34:19,693 --> 00:34:21,809
And if I'm not very much mistaken,

388
00:34:22,373 --> 00:34:26,571
it seems you are falling in love with me too.

389
00:34:30,293 --> 00:34:34,081
- I got her voicemail.
- Would you order me a hamburger?

390
00:34:36,533 --> 00:34:38,330
Of course.

391
00:34:41,133 --> 00:34:43,601
- What is she doing?
- I don't know.

392
00:34:44,653 --> 00:34:47,121
Why did she take off her jacket?

393
00:34:54,173 --> 00:34:58,052
What is going on here?
She has no intention of leaving that room.

394
00:35:00,213 --> 00:35:04,365
- Room service. How may I help you?
- Hello? A hamburger, please.

395
00:35:04,453 --> 00:35:07,968
- All right. Everything on that?
- Yes, everything.

396
00:35:08,053 --> 00:35:10,248
- We'll send it right up.
- OK.

397
00:35:13,613 --> 00:35:16,002
What's that in her hand?

398
00:35:16,853 --> 00:35:21,005
So, now... is there anything else?

399
00:35:22,653 --> 00:35:23,722
Yes.

400
00:35:23,813 --> 00:35:26,611
- Oh, my God. She's got a knife!
- SWAT team, hit the room.

401
00:35:26,693 --> 00:35:28,684
Hit the room now!

402
00:35:29,973 --> 00:35:32,248
Son of a bitch!

403
00:35:36,973 --> 00:35:39,123
Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch!

404
00:35:39,213 --> 00:35:42,922
Hold your fire! Get me
some towels from the bathroom!

405
00:35:45,093 --> 00:35:47,687
Nina, call in a medevac. We're losing him!

406
00:35:47,773 --> 00:35:50,924
We cannot let him die! Dammit!

407
00:36:18,653 --> 00:36:21,451
- Just a minute.
- Yeah, sure.

408
00:36:54,013 --> 00:36:55,890
Um... I'm looking for Rick.

409
00:36:56,933 --> 00:36:59,128
- Who are you?
- A friend.

410
00:37:01,373 --> 00:37:03,443
Are you the one that keeps calling?

411
00:37:03,533 --> 00:37:06,764
- He said that I could come over.
- Not to me, he didn't.

412
00:37:08,253 --> 00:37:12,292
- Um... maybe you should ask him, then...
- I was about to tell you.

413
00:37:12,373 --> 00:37:15,092
I just didn't think she'd get here so fast.

414
00:37:15,173 --> 00:37:17,403
What's going on, Rick?

415
00:37:17,493 --> 00:37:19,848
I'll explain everything.

416
00:37:19,933 --> 00:37:23,562
- I'm listening.
- First let her come in.

417
00:37:24,413 --> 00:37:26,404
It's OK.

418
00:37:29,053 --> 00:37:30,771
What does she want?

419
00:37:31,533 --> 00:37:35,128
Something got screwed up with Dan
last night. Big surprise, right?

420
00:37:35,213 --> 00:37:39,252
That's why my arm was all messed up.
The guys Dan was with shot me and...

421
00:37:39,333 --> 00:37:41,927
You said you cut your arm on a fence.

422
00:37:45,533 --> 00:37:50,402
Um... these people Dan knows,
I need to find them.

423
00:37:50,493 --> 00:37:54,486
And I was hoping that I could go in his room
and find something to lead me to them.

424
00:37:54,573 --> 00:37:58,691
- A phone number, an address...
- So you wanna look through Dan's room?

425
00:37:58,773 --> 00:37:59,967
Yeah.

426
00:38:04,413 --> 00:38:08,406
I was wondering if I could
borrow some money for the cab.

427
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:42,126
Teri.

428
00:38:43,413 --> 00:38:45,608
You all right?

429
00:38:50,293 --> 00:38:52,284
You don't remember me?

430
00:38:58,453 --> 00:39:00,603
- Phil?
- Yes.

431
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:04,164
Are you my doctor?

432
00:39:04,253 --> 00:39:06,528
No, not exactly.

433
00:39:06,613 --> 00:39:09,810
Henry, thanks for calling.
Has she had anything to eat or drink?

434
00:39:09,893 --> 00:39:12,691
I offered, but she didn't want anything.

435
00:39:15,933 --> 00:39:17,924
No, it's...

436
00:39:18,973 --> 00:39:21,362
Unless you want some water?

437
00:39:21,453 --> 00:39:23,648
- Sure.
- OK. Some water.

438
00:39:25,493 --> 00:39:29,088
All right, listen. We're gonna
figure out what this is all about.

439
00:39:29,173 --> 00:39:33,883
We're gonna get you well again.
Do you understand? It's gonna be fine.

440
00:39:33,973 --> 00:39:36,612
Everything's gonna be fine.

441
00:39:40,533 --> 00:39:43,491
What do you want me to say?
We misjudged her emotional state.

442
00:39:43,573 --> 00:39:47,122
- No, we didn't. You did.
- It was an unexpected outcome for everyone.

443
00:39:47,213 --> 00:39:50,330
- It's what I said it would be. It was a bad idea.
- Fine. Maybe.

444
00:39:50,413 --> 00:39:54,486
- Now we need to figure out our next move.
- What is that? What's the status on Alexis?

445
00:39:54,573 --> 00:39:59,249
He has a fifty-fifty shot, but even if he comes
through, we don't know how long till he talks.

446
00:39:59,333 --> 00:40:02,564
Did you find anything in the room?
Any phone numbers? Documents?

447
00:40:02,653 --> 00:40:05,247
- No, nothing yet.
- What do I tell District?

448
00:40:05,333 --> 00:40:09,565
Whatever you have to. Just keep them off
my back. I need time before I fill out reports.

449
00:40:09,653 --> 00:40:11,132
- Let me in!
- Hold on.

450
00:40:11,213 --> 00:40:13,932
- Where's Elizabeth? There was a stabbing?
- She's fine.

451
00:40:14,013 --> 00:40:16,925
- Where is she?
- She's across the hall. She's in custody.

452
00:40:17,013 --> 00:40:19,368
- What?! Why?
- She stabbed Drazen.

453
00:40:19,453 --> 00:40:22,490
- She was defending herself.
- No, that's not how it went down.

454
00:40:22,573 --> 00:40:27,363
- She broke from the plan. She attacked him.
- I should never have let her do it!

455
00:40:27,453 --> 00:40:29,728
- I gotta call you back.
- What's going on there?

456
00:40:29,813 --> 00:40:32,281
- Senator!
- Let me in.

457
00:40:33,373 --> 00:40:36,570
- Senator...
- Say nothing until you speak to a lawyer.

458
00:40:36,653 --> 00:40:40,532
- I'm sorry. I don't know what happened.
- It's all right. We'll work this out.

459
00:40:40,613 --> 00:40:43,446
Senator, please let us handle this.

460
00:40:43,533 --> 00:40:45,967
I let you do that before,
and look where we are!

461
00:40:46,053 --> 00:40:48,089
You are not helping matters right now.

462
00:40:48,173 --> 00:40:51,609
- Jack!
- Excuse me for one second.

463
00:40:51,693 --> 00:40:55,288
- What?
- It's Alexis's phone. What do we do?

464
00:41:05,213 --> 00:41:07,408
We gotta take a chance.

465
00:41:09,013 --> 00:41:12,050
- Yeah?
- Do you have the money?

466
00:41:12,133 --> 00:41:15,045
- Yeah.
- OK. We'll meet in 45 minutes.

467
00:41:15,133 --> 00:41:16,930
- Where?
- I already told you!

468
00:41:19,173 --> 00:41:21,164
At Connie's. Downtown.

469
00:41:22,773 --> 00:41:26,368
- How will I recognise you?
- I'll wear a red baseball cap.
