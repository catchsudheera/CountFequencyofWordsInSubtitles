1
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,676
- I need Karen Hayes to go away.
- I understand, sir.

2
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,479
I need the president
to sign off on my proposals.

3
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,870
She has gone from
being an irritant to an obstacle.

4
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,630
I wanna talk about your husband's
incompetence and your covering it up.

5
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,790
I did nothing illegal or incorrect.

6
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,110
Your resignation within the hour.

7
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,599
Mr President, I am tendering my resignation.

8
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,875
Is there anything I can do
to change your mind?

9
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,518
No, sir. There is not.

10
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:43,874
Walid has earned their trust. These men know
something about the bombs that we don't.

11
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:47,589
These guys aren't connected to anyone.
They're not terrorists.

12
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,716
I'm getting Walid the hell out of there.

13
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,156
You spied on us?
You're worse than they are!

14
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,958
Son of a bitch!

15
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:04,156
A nuclear bomb just went off,
like, 25 miles from here.

16
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:07,596
When I'm done with this deal,
I may just buy you a small country.

17
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,990
- Have you found an engineer?
- I told you I would. Now I will.

18
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,957
It's just taking longer.

19
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,235
Start talking, Gray.

20
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:18,471
I made a mess. Dad's trying to clean it up.

21
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,232
<i>(Jack) What happened?</i>

22
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,709
I hired McCarthy to oversee the job.

23
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:27,032
The nukes the terrorists are in possession of,
including the one detonated in Valencia,

24
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,509
were supplied by McCarthy
and stolen from you?

25
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,350
Yes.

26
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:34,035
- Heading to McCarthy's office in Simi Valley.
- Teams are standing by.

27
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,555
Stop. He's my son.

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,391
- What are you doing here, Jack?
- I know you're covering up. Gray told me.

29
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,311
McCarthy's not here.

30
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,713
Hey! What are you doing? Put the gun down.

31
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,076
- You work for me.
- No, Dad, he doesn't.

32
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:57,436
You don't think I'd let you loose
without keeping an eye on you?

33
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,669
This is insane.

34
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,719
I am at the edge of the safe zone

35
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,360
and behind me is the nuclear blast.

36
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,591
Emergency teams are overwhelmed
by the number of injured

37
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,071
<i>in what President Palmer has confirmed
was a tactical nuclear weapon</i>

38
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:35,598
<i>detonated two hours ago in this Valencia
neighbourhood north of Los Angeles.</i>

39
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,674
<i>More than 12,000 people are estimated
to have perished in the blast.</i>

40
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,751
<i>LAPD is spread thin</i>

41
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,991
<i>but, on an encouraging note,
we've heard that they are...</i>

42
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,074
I just heard about Karen's resignation.
I'm sorry for the loss.

43
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:54,914
Are you really sorry? Because your worry
seems somewhat hollow to me.

44
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,833
Karen and I have butted heads
the last few weeks.

45
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,196
Nevertheless, I respected her as an adversary.

46
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,555
She never gave me a reason
why she resigned,

47
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,632
but there was something
she wasn't telling me.

48
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,871
This may have something to do with it.

49
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,991
This is the executive order
I presented this morning.

50
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:18,277
Karen found out I was going
to resubmit it to you.

51
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,272
So she quit?
That makes absolutely no sense to me, Tom.

52
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,271
She's never been afraid of a fight.

53
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,397
Maybe she finally realised
her arguments are invalid

54
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,189
and that this is the only possible response
to the danger we're facing.

55
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,636
Why would I sign off on something
I rejected six hours ago?

56
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,678
Because six hours ago
we didn't know Fayed had nukes.

57
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,911
Even so, you're talking about
suspending habeas corpus,

58
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,198
expanding the length and broadening
the criteria for those detention centres.

59
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,670
Those actions would constitute
an abuse of executive power.

60
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,558
Those actions will
degrade Fayed's network,

61
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:55,395
limiting his ability to make use
of these remaining nuclear weapons.

62
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:59,359
Sir, Fayed's sole intention here
is the destruction of our country,

63
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,796
its infrastructure,
social order, entire way of life.

64
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,758
He has the will and means
to make good on that threat.

65
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,833
Have you stopped to think that
I would be forcing the people who elected me

66
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,230
to give up their rights
that define the essence of this country?

67
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:19,429
Sir, if one more nuke goes off, it will have
been Fayed who has redefined our country.

68
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:39,439
Pass this out to the cabinet.
We'll convene in 30 minutes.

69
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,195
You're doing the right thing, Mr President.

70
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,634
Reed.

71
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,711
Call the cabinet in for a session.

72
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,236
- We are ramping up.
- Is the president signing off on this?

73
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,676
He wouldn't convene the cabinet
unless he was. Good work, Reed.

74
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:05,719
- I'm just doing what needs to be done.
- Getting rid of Karen was unpleasant

75
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,597
but she left us no choice.

76
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,274
<i>(phone rings)</i>

77
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,595
- Hayes.
- Sorry I'm late with the briefing.

78
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,955
We're tracking Fayed through McCarthy.

79
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:20,113
- Bill. I've just had to resign.
- Resign? What are you taking about?

80
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:24,796
I can't get into it now, but I've asked to be
reassigned to CTU as an on-site liaison.

81
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,348
Karen, you can't leave the president today.

82
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,399
Bill, do you think that I would do this
if I had any other choice?

83
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:35,678
- Lennox had something to do with this.
- I cannot talk about this right now.

84
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,716
I will see you in a few hours, OK?

85
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,597
<i>Karen...</i>

86
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,951
<i>(phone rings)</i>

87
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,917
- Mr Buchanan?
- What is it, Chloe?

88
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,675
- Jack's not answering his cell phone.
- Try his backup teams.

89
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:20,356
I tried. They're not answering either.
Maybe he had them all go dark.

90
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:24,319
He wouldn't do that without telling us first.
Send in a support unit.

91
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,152
- Fine.
- And keep trying Jack.

92
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,231
All right.

93
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:33,028
- Where do you want us to meet?
- I'll be here an hour dumping hard drives.

94
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,908
- We'll meet you back at the house.
- Make sure it goes according to plan.

95
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,231
- Don't worry.
- It's my job to worry.

96
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,549
<i>(Phillip) It was all for you, Jack.</i>

97
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:50,433
Everything I worked for, everything I built.

98
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,556
It was all for you.

99
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:58,918
After you left, I tried to convince myself that
Graem was capable of heading the family,

100
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,195
protecting the company.

101
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,710
I guess on some level
I always knew the truth about him.

102
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,395
I just wasn't willing to admit it to myself.

103
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:14,197
I don't know what you want me to say.

104
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,158
I want you to understand.

105
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,357
After you left, Graem was all I had.

106
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,670
He pushed you away, didn't he?

107
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,119
I'm really sorry.

108
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,351
Get out. Come on.

109
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,436
Don't do this, Irv.
Whatever Graem's paying you, I'll double it.

110
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,351
Just keep it moving.

111
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,629
Get down on your knees, both of you.

112
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,835
No. You son of a bitch,
at least have the guts to look me in the eye.

113
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,834
I needed to question him.

114
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,990
They were gonna kill us, Jack!

115
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,311
Search his pockets for the keys.

116
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,391
Dammit!

117
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,839
<i>- (phone rings)
- Buchanan.</i>

118
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:12,913
<i>- Bill, it's Jack.
- We couldn't reach you. Are you all right?</i>

119
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,630
- I'm fine but the backup team has been killed.
- Have you found McCarthy?

120
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,950
- I know how to get to him.
- How?

121
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:24,716
- My brother.
- You said your brother wasn't involved.

122
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,156
- He lied to me. He didn't tell us everything.
- Based on what?

123
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,677
He tried to have me and my dad killed. I need
you to set up a perimeter around his house.

124
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:36,469
- I'll send a field team right away.
- Have them do an immediate recon.

125
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,518
I want Burke standing by
with an interrogation kit.

126
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,749
<i>- Jack.
- What?</i>

127
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:45,960
McCarthy is our only lead to Fayed. We need
to find Fayed before he arms the nukes.

128
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:52,036
I'll get back to you as soon as I make contact
with the field teams. We need to go.

129
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,719
Rita?

130
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:04,228
- Where do you think you're going?
- There's a candy machine in the lobby.

131
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,039
- We'll be leaving soon.
- You said that an hour ago.

132
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,429
Sit down, Rita.

133
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,069
<i>(Fayed) Yes?</i>

134
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:23,676
Good news. I've found someone
to program the trigger codes for your bombs.

135
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,558
<i>- Who?
- I just sent you his profile.</i>

136
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,997
<i>Employment record, education, the whole CV.
You should have it on your screen.</i>

137
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,799
I'm looking at it now. He seems qualified.

138
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:39,159
He'll get the job done, but he won't work
willingly. He'll need to be coerced.

139
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:43,392
- OK. When will you have him?
- Within the hour.

140
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,789
Call me when you do.

141
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,672
- Mr Buchanan, you need to listen to this.
- What?

142
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,469
NSA intercepted a stream of chatter.
Part of it's an audio recording.

143
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:08,950
They've identified one of the voices
as belonging to Fayed.

144
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,715
<i>(McCarthy) I've found someone
to program the trigger codes on your bombs.</i>

145
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,268
<i>- (Fayed) Who?
- I just sent you his profile.</i>

146
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,069
<i>Employment record, education, the whole CV.

147
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,833

work willingly. He'll need to be coerced.</i>

149
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:29,555
<i>- (Fayed) OK. When will you have him?
- Within the hour.</i>

150
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,796
The second voice matches the sample
from McCarthy's voicemail.

151
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:37,998
They lost Numair in the explosion, so
McCarthy found someone to arm the nukes.

152
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:42,437
Have audio forensics scan for background
artefacts that could give us a location.

153
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:45,080
- Yes, sir.
- I got Morris working on something.

154
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:49,995
We also found an image file inside the data
stream. It might be a photo of the engineer.

155
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,913
- This it?
- It got all corrupted during the intercept.

156
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,355
I'm writing a salvage utility.

157
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,989
<i>(Buchanan) Recovering this may be
our only way to stop those nukes.</i>

158
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:02,629
- Give me an estimate.
- Could be ten minutes, could be an hour.

159
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,711
All teams confirm.

160
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,113
Who's the agent in charge?

161
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,670
- My name is Jack Bauer.
- Mr Bauer, I'm Al Turner. I'll be on point.

162
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,752
- Are your men in position?
- We've sealed off one block

163
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,354
and recon has confirmed
your brother's inside.

164
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,670
His wife and son are in there as well.

165
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,150
Use nonlethal force.
We need to take my brother alive.

166
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,993
- Understood. Attention...
- Let me go in with you.

167
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,913
No. You wait here.

168
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,070
I need to question Graem alone.

169
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,310
What are you gonna do to him?

170
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,834
Whatever it takes to find out what he knows.

171
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,234
I'm not stupid. I know something is wrong.

172
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,790
- Everything's fine.
- You're a lousy liar. You always have been.

173
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,997
- Why don't you make some coffee?
- Make your own coffee!

174
00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:00,198
Will you two stop fighting?
All you guys ever do is fight.

175
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,510
I'm sorry, honey.
We're just all a little tense today.

176
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,750
What's going on?

177
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:13,108
Nothing. Nothing. Why don't...
why don't we leave your father alone?

178
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,350
He needs to work.

179
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,754
Put the weapon down! Drop the gun!

180
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,912
- What the hell is this, Jack?
- Put it down!

181
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,075
Do it.

182
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,474
Get on the floor. Get on the floor!

183
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,554
- Take it easy!
- Take him into the next room.

184
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:44,758
Have Burke prep him for questioning.
I want every drive in this house uploaded

185
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:48,833
and sent over to CTU.
Pick him up. Go. Go!

186
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,795
- What are you doing to my dad?
- I'll explain as soon as I can.

187
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:57,156
Please, just take a seat. Please, come on.

188
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,315
Let go of me!

189
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:15,154
Stop looking at me like this has
something to do with us. It doesn't.

190
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:19,711
- Gray tried to have me and our father killed.
- Why? Why would he try and kill you?

191
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:24,874
The nuclear bomb that was detonated today
was acquired from the family's company.

192
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,633
Gray's been trying to cover it up.

193
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:33,272
I'm sorry, Marilyn. I understand
how difficult this must be for you to believe.

194
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,351
It's not.

195
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:40,956
I may not know the details of what he's done
but I know what he's capable of.

196
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:45,636
There are four more other bombs out there.
Is there anything that you can tell me?

197
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,837
- Like what?
- Did Gray talk about a man named McCarthy?

198
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,150
- No.
- Are you sure?

199
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,915
He hasn't confided in me in years.
He probably never did.

200
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,754
Marilyn, thousands of lives are at stake.
Please, just think.

201
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:02,196
I wish I knew something, I wish I did,
but I don't know anything.

202
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:05,352
Josh doesn't know anything
and he doesn't need to know.

203
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,671
- I'll do everything I can to protect him.
- No!

204
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:12,036
No, I've seen what happens
when you try and protect people.

205
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,874
I just wanna get my son
and I wanna get outta here!

206
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,114
- Marilyn!
- Sir.

207
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,112
We found two computers.
He was trying to erase files.

208
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:25,716
- We're sending what's left over to CTU.
- OK, good.

209
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,870
My sister-in-law and my nephew don't need
to stay here. Have them transported to CTU.

210
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,951
Yes, sir.

211
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:42,278
Ms Bauer, we're taking you
and your son back to CTU.

212
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,391
- Josh?
- Grandpa.

213
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,835
- Are you OK?
- Not really.

214
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,115
Wait in the car, baby.

215
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:20,799
Jack told me what Graem did,
what he was involved with.

216
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,871
Is it true?

217
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,918
- It's complicated.
- But it's true.

218
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,113
You make sure he keeps Josh out of this.

219
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:58,552
I panicked, Jack. That's all there is to it.

220
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,751
You panicked?

221
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:05,434
That's your excuse? You panicked?!

222
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,636
You tried to kill me and our father.

223
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:10,518
I was backed into a corner.
I was protecting my ass.

224
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:14,513
You knew about a tactical nuclear weapon
on American soil.

225
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,353
You were responsible
for the death of thousands.

226
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,431
You think I wanted that bomb to go off?

227
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:23,229
I think you knew more about McCarthy
than you told me.

228
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,629
- How do I find him?
- I don't have a clue.

229
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:29,315
- How do I find him?!
- I just told you, I don't know.

230
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:34,633
There are four more bombs out there.
This isn't ajoke, Gray.

231
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:41,588
- Tell me now, how do I find McCarthy?
- I've told you everything I know, Jack.

232
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:47,835
Perspiration and temperature patterns
indicate deception, especially his last reply.

233
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,918
Set up the interrogation package.

234
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:05,995
- You don't wanna make me do this, Gray.
- We grew up together, Jack.

235
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:12,076
In all those years I could never make you
do anything you didn't wanna do.

236
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,958
- I need to talk to you.
- What is it?

237
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:50,074
- It's Morris's brother.
- Timothy?

238
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,594
He's on his way to Horizon Regional Hospital.

239
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:57,708
On-site paramedics confirmed
he has severe radiation exposure.

240
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:01,236
It says he's in critical condition.

241
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,796
- I'll tell him.
- Chloe.

242
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,034
- I think we should hold off.
- Why?

243
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,873
Morris is our best hope for restoring that file.

244
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,394
If we drop this on him now,
he might shut down.

245
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:18,156
- It's his brother. We can't keep it a secret.
- I understand this might sound insensitive,

246
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,597
but put aside your personal feelings
for Morris and consider what's at stake.

247
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:27,800
- We need him to finish that salvage utility.
- I know Morris. He can handle it.

248
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,314
I hope so.

249
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,157
- Morris.
- Yes, darling?

250
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,115
I have some bad news.

251
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:50,752
It's about Timothy.
He's been taken to the hospital. I'm sorry.

252
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:57,276
This can't be right. It says he was pulled from
his car by rescue workers north of Valencia.

253
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:04,630
Could you connect me with Horizon Regional
Hospital? What was he doing in Valencia?

254
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,110
<i>- I'm sorry. All circuits are busy.
- I realise the lines are busy.</i>

255
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,839
This is CTU.
I need an emergency breakthrough.

256
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:14,469
<i>I can't help you at this time, sir. I'm sorry.</i>

257
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,632
- I have to go out there.
- Morris, hey.

258
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,234
I know it's hard.
We are in the middle of a crisis.

259
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,710
We need to find the engineer
before Fayed does. You can't leave.

260
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:36,239
You can't expect me to sit there while my
little brother is dying in a hospital. I'm sorry.

261
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,914
Morris, listen.

262
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,232
12,000 people are dead. If Fayed finds
an engineer, it'll be many, many more.

263
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:47,916
Four bombs is about a million people.
Think about this.

264
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:54,352
- You can finish writing the program.
- Yes, I can, but you started already.

265
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:57,398
It'll take me half an hour
to figure out what you've done.

266
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:00,472
You need to stay here and do yourjob.

267
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,349
Please.

268
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,753
OK.

269
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,319
Thanks.

270
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:20,355
<i>- Buchanan.
- Did Chloe pull anything off the hard drives?</i>

271
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:25,878
She came up empty, but the NSA picked up
a conversation between McCarthy and Fayed.

272
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:29,748
McCarthy's found another engineer
to arm the four remaining nukes.

273
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:34,231
- He's delivering him within the hour.
- The nukes will be operational in 45 minutes?

274
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,311
I'll get back to you.

275
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:51,830
CTU confirmed that McCarthy is looking for
an engineer for Fayed. They'll arm the nukes.

276
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:56,198
<i>- You're wasting time talking to me.
- (Jack) You're holding something back.</i>

277
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:59,352
<i>(Graem) I told you everything I know.</i>

278
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:09,597
That's hyoscine pentothal. It's a
neuroinflammatory designed to induce pain.

279
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:14,439
All you have to do to stop me from using it
is tell me how to find McCarthy.

280
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,511
Your guess is as good as mine.

281
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,551
Two ccs.

282
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,071
<i>(moans)</i>

283
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,594
<i>- Come on, come on.
- (screams)</i>

284
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:56,468
I can take this to seven ccs.
You will experience pain I can't even describe.

285
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:00,439
At eight ccs I run the risk
of inducing a heart attack.

286
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:04,593
Gray, make no mistake about it,
I will go there if I have to.

287
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:08,070
Please, just tell me what I need to know.

288
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:12,551
- Please. I don't wanna hurt you.
- Oh, you sure about that, Jack?

289
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,677
Please, Gray, just tell me what I need to know.

290
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,955
How do I find McCarthy?!

291
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,711
Do it. Two ccs.

00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,635
How do I find McCarthy?!

296
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:50,037
Damn you. Damn you. Four ccs.

297
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:53,157
That's eight ccs total.
His vitals are spiking across the line.

298
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,356
- Four ccs!
- Jack, don't!

299
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:00,074
The machine knows you're lying!
I know you're lying! Tell me the truth!

300
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,355
<i>Tell me the truth!</i>

301
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,431
<i>(screams)</i>

302
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,350
This has nothing to do with McCarthy.

303
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,113
- It has to do with Palmer.
- David Palmer?

304
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,349
Yeah.

305
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,193
I gave the order for his assassination,

306
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,594
and Agent Tony Almeida

307
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:32,310
and Agent Michelle Dessler, your co-workers.

308
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,630
They're all dead because of me.

309
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,631
I arranged everything.

310
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,870
I set the timetable.

311
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,554
I- I paid off the killers.

312
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:46,148
I even lured you out of hiding to take the fall.

313
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:52,636
Today wasn't the first time
I've tried to have you killed, Jack.

314
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,117
Why?

315
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,873
Because I love my country!

316
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,551
And in the real world, sometimes that means
you have to do things, terrible things,

317
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:07,633
even unforgivable things,
for the sake of your country.

318
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:11,914
But you know all about that,
don't you, brother?

319
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,831
We're the same.

320
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:17,708
I mean, look at me. We're the same!

321
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:21,793
We are not the same!
You want me to kill you?

322
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,519
- Do it!
- I'm gonna do it my way. Four more ccs.

323
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:28,434
- I can't do that.
- Pick up the syringe. Do it! Now!

324
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,839
- Son of a bitch!
- Get me somebody in here now!

325
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:35,878
Do you wanna die?
Drop your weapon!

326
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,428
Drop it!

327
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,309
You're gonna die.

328
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:02,315
Shut down the IV. Shut it down.

329
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,911
I'm here, baby.

330
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,509
I'm ashamed.

331
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,114
What do you mean, you're ashamed?

332
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,475
For spying on those men.

333
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:58,556
I thought I was doing the right thing,
but I was wrong.

334
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:05,038
You did the only thing that you could do,
OK? And that was the right thing.

335
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:13,997
Look, you're the bravest,
most principled man I've ever known.

336
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,828
<i>(phone rings)</i>

337
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:23,229
You get some rest, OK?

338
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,188
Hello?

339
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:40,317
Sandra, it's Wayne.

340
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:46,555
I just heard what happened to Walid.
I am so sorry. Is he gonna be all right?

341
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,517
Yeah, I think so.

342
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,636
What they told me is confusing.

343
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,998
They said Walid was working undercover
to expose some plot?

344
00:27:55,080 --> 00:28:00,359
There was no plot. The men weren't part of
any conspiracy. They were just bystanders.

345
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:03,989
They told me these men had information
about the nuclear weapons.

346
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,958
One of the men pulled it from the internet.

347
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,349
Sandra, they should've reported that.

348
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:13,638
They were afraid they were gonna get
into more trouble than they're already in.

349
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:16,917
Most of these men were pulled
from theirjobs and their homes

350
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,275
on trumped-up immigration charges,

351
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,510
and now they're facing deportation.

352
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,831
Wayne, you are detaining
without due process

353
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:27,388
the people whose help
you need the most.

354
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:31,837
How do you expect for them to help
if they don't have any legal protection?

355
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,480
<i>Wayne,</i>

356
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:37,120
<i>I'm scared.</i>

357
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,794
I know.

358
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:42,474
Everything's gonna be all right.

359
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,636
- What's the status?
- I ran the program but this is all we got.

360
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,712
- I still don't have a clear image.
- What are you doing?

361
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:56,396
I'm downloading an application from
a hacker's site. It might kick-start things.

362
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,994
- It could corrupt the file.
- I know these guys.

363
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:03,073
They write really good code,
when they're not serving time.

364
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:06,038
Unbelievable.
That's what Graem was holding back?

365
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:10,352
He was responsible for Palmer's
assassination. He directed the conspiracy.

366
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:13,796
He was trying to protect the company.
He's trying to do that now.

367
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,838
- Incredible.
- I wish it got us closer to the nukes.

368
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:21,152
He doesn't know where McCarthy is.
Were you able to pick up anything on chatter?

369
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:24,630
<i>- Maybe an image of McCarthy's engineer.
- How long till you know?</i>

370
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,632
The file's corrupted.
Morris is working on it now.

371
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:31,190
As soon as my brother is ready,
I want him sent back to CTU.

372
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:34,795
I've redirected a chopper
to Jackson Middle School.

373
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,871
Thanks, Bill.

374
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:18,795
Dad, Graem made his own choices
after you let him start running the company.

375
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,668
You can't make yourself responsible for that.
It's not fair.

376
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:26,677
I'll tell you what isn't fair.

377
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:29,797
You deserved a better family, Jack.

378
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:32,440
Not this.

379
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,871
Not us.

380
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:40,355
I can just imagine what you must be feeling.

381
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,595
All that time we lost.

382
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,397
What I wouldn't give to have some of it back.

383
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,473
Me too.

384
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,994
Your brother's been stabilised.
He'll be ready to move in ten minutes.

385
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,071
Thank you.

386
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:08,278
Dad, I want you to go back to CTU.

387
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,877
OK.

388
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:17,553
I need a few minutes.

389
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,671
Of course.

390
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:24,832
They're sending a chopper for me.

391
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:27,514
I have to go.

392
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:09,117
- There.
- What?

393
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,998
- The plug-in's working.
- How long is it gonna take?

394
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:16,471
You'll have a photo of the engineer
in two minutes. Just don't touch anything.

395
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:20,030
I have got to find out
what's happening to my brother. Save it.

396
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:22,634
Thanks for trying to help.

397
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:27,679
- I'm leaving. Watch my station, OK?
- Call me when you find out about Timothy.

398
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,751
I will.

399
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,999
Congratulations, Tom,
it's an excellent plan.

400
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,310
Thank you very much, Mr Vice President.

401
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:44,996
It's about time someone in this administration
stood up to these people.

402
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:50,799
To be honest, I didn't think this president
had the stomach for the cure.

403
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,998
I think we're about ready for kickoff here, sir.
I'll put you on speakerphone.

404
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:02,116
<i>- Is the vice president with us?
- I'm here, Mr President.</i>

405
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:06,239
I'm assuming everyone here
has read Executive Order 1066.

406
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:11,314
Tom first proposed his plan to me
very early this morning, and I rejected it.

407
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:15,279
Sacrificing the rights and freedoms
guaranteed by the Constitution

408
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,557
seemed like... like too steep a price,

409
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,108
even for the promise of security.

410
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:27,150
But then Fayed murdered 12,000
innocent Americans with a nuclear weapon.

411
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:31,354
I felt compelled to revisit my earlier position.

412
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,993
After careful reconsideration

413
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:40,832
I remain convinced that my initial response
was in fact the right one -

414
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:45,198
that implementing this plan
would be a terrible mistake.

415
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:49,592
Now, I cannot and I will not
endorse these actions.

416
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:54,392
Some of you seem to feel

417
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:59,349
that the Constitution is somehow valid
only during times of peace,

418
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,476
but not during wartime.

419
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:04,354
<i>That is not what the founders intended.</i>

420
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:09,309
With your indulgence, sir, George
Washington's enemies wore bright red coats

421
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,391
and marched in a straight line.

422
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:16,315
The founders could never have conceived
of a stateless enemy hiding among us

423
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:19,676
that targets not our soldiers
but our civilisation.

424
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:23,799
Your plan would only hinder the efforts
of law enforcement to stop Fayed.

425
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:27,077
<i>(Lennox) How does my plan
hinder law enforcement, sir?</i>

426
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:33,156
By marginalising and thereby radicalising the
very people whose help they need to enlist.

427
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:40,638
The American Muslim community is our
best line of defence against these terrorists.

428
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:46,909
But we Americans need to demonstrate
that we are governed by the rule of law

429
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,994
and never, never by the politics of fear.

430
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:55,072
- Mr President?
- Yes, Noah?

431
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:57,355
Before you make unilateral decisions,

432
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:00,352
maybe you should hear
some other people's thoughts.

433
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:04,319
I'm sorry, Noah.
The discussion on this matter

434
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,591
is over.

435
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,153
<i>- This better work.
- (Buchanan) Jack's on his way.</i>

436
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,913
I want Holding A and B prepped
for interrogation

437
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,073
and put together a clearance package for him,
no restrictions.

438
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,958
<i>- Do you have it yet?
- (Chloe) A few more seconds.</i>

439
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:27,875
As soon as we ID the engineer, post it on the
interagency subnet. We need all eyes on this.

440
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,520
- Yes, sir.
- Oh, my God.

441
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:34,229
It's Morris. His clearance level,
personal history, everything.

442
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:37,039
<i>- (Buchanan) Where is he?
- On his way to the hospital.</i>

443
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:41,511
We got a call that his brother
was hurt in the blast. He just left.

444
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:46,037
This is Buchanan.
Has Morris O'Brian left the parking lot?

445
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:49,590
<i>- (man) He just drove out, sir.
- Dammit.</i>

446
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,638
Milo, contact LAPD.
Put an APB out on his car.

447
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:56,713
Chloe, see if you can raise him
on his cell phone.

448
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:01,509
<i>- Bauer.
- We just ID'd the engineer. It's Morris O'Brian.</i>

449
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,999
- Morris?
- Yes.

450
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:07,710
The file we intercepted was Morris's photo
and CV. McCarthy was sending it to Fayed.

451
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:11,190
- There is no doubt.
- Fine, put him under a protective watch.

452
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:15,193
We can't. He's gone. He got a call
claiming his brother was in the hospital.

453
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,430
We're trying to raise him on his cell.

454
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,670
Morris, hold on! He's on line one.

455
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,115
<i>- We got him, Jack.
- Patch me through.</i>

456
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:25,272
Morris, it's Bill Buchanan with Jack Bauer.
Where are you?

457
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:28,557
- On my way to the hospital.
- Come back to CTU immediately.

458
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,631
- I can't do that.
- This is Jack.

459
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:33,439
There is nothing wrong with your brother.
It's a setup.

460
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:36,512
- The engineer McCarthy's looking for is you.
- Me?

461
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:39,114
It was your photo
McCarthy was sending to Fayed.

462
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:43,159
<i>- (Jack) You need to turn the car around now.
- Uh, OK. OK.</i>

463
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,194
<i>- (gunshots)
- Morris!</i>

464
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,830
- Get out of the car.
- What do you want?

465
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:55,037
Don't talk, move! Come on. Let's go.

466
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,873
- They got him.
- Sounds like a transfer to another vehicle.

467
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:03,637
Chloe, bring up a satellite feed,
five-mile radius of CTU. Hurry, hurry!

468
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,154
Drive.

469
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:19,559
<i>- (phone rings)
- Yes?</i>

470
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,995
<i>- (McCarthy) We're on our way.
- How soon?</i>

471
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:24,196
<i>- 15 minutes.
- We'll be waiting.</i>

472
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:27,670
- With my money.
- You'll get paid when I have what I want.

473
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:32,356
Let me be clear. I'm just delivering him.
You'll have to make him cooperate.

474
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,474
He'll cooperate.

475
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,636
Agent Burke.

476
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:10,154
I'd like to speak with my son.

477
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,470
All right. Five minutes.

478
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:15,231
<i>(Phillip) Thanks.</i>

479
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,955
How am I doing?

480
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,269
You're doing great.

481
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:40,711
Everyone thinks Jack is so tough.
And maybe he is.

482
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,995
But so am I.

483
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:48,312
It's nice to know that I can take
anything he can dish out.

484
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:53,230
- You told him about Palmer.
- I had to make him think I cracked.

485
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:55,675
But I kept you out of it.

486
00:38:56,520 --> 00:39:01,674
It's gonna get a lot worse. He's not finished.
He knows you didn't tell him everything.

487
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:05,036
Yeah, and I won't. You know I won't, Dad.

488
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:12,269
They'll take you to CTU. They'll do things
there that will make this seem like a cakewalk.

489
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,396
Like I said,

490
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,869
I can take it.

491
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,554
I'd like to believe that.

492
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:22,313
Problem is, I have to be sure.

493
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,675
Well, you can be.

494
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,596
I'll hold my mud, Dad.

495
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:31,593
Everything's going exactly according to plan.
Jack bought the ruse.

496
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:36,071
Oh, I know. I'm sure we convinced him that
you were gonna have me killed as well.

497
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:39,550
Yeah. That makes me the bad guy
and you the good guy.

498
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:43,189
I take the rap, do some time.
You escape free, get me out when you can.

499
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:46,590
Meanwhile, the company lives on.

500
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:49,399
Dad, stick to the plan.

501
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:54,474
That's what you've always said, right?
Make a plan and stick to it.

502
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:58,314
Sometimes you have to make adjustments.

503
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,510
I would never betray you, Dad.

504
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:06,110
I love you.

505
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,998
I love you, too, Graem.

506
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:11,389
You've been a good boy.

507
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:14,153
You've done everything I asked.

508
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,196
Only this time

509
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,475
I asked too much.

510
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,391
I'm sorry.

511
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,673
Dad...

512
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,751
<i>(coughs)</i>

513
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,231
<i>(muffled screaming)</i>

514
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:09,673
My son's had a seizure!
Get in here now! Hurry up!

515
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,390
What happened? Is he gonna make it?

516
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:17,395
I don't know. Please give us the room
so we can work. Get CTU medical now!

517
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:21,109
My God. If you people killed my son,

518
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,316
I swear,

519
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:27,393
you're gonna regret it for the rest of your life.

520
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,551
