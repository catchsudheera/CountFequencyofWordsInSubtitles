1
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,719
- Wayne said you wanted to see me.
- Keeler.

2
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,268
He's bringing your ex-husband
into this debate.

3
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,510
The SEC's investigation into his company.

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,989
Ted served his sentence.
You know that.

5
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,878
All Ted Packard wants is money.

6
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,428
If we pay him off,
he'll recant before this debate.

7
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:33,115
- It's blackmail.
- We can have the money within the hour.

8
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,598
- I thought you were with my dad.
- Your dad's sidelining me. Making me sit out.

9
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,433
Look, I know my dad can be hard.
But he will come around.

10
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,317
We shouldn't have told him.

11
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,870
The only other option
is for us to stop seeing each other.

12
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,350
- Chase, what do you want?
- I wanna be able to do my job.

13
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:55,352
Linda! I need your help. These guys...
they'll kill me if I don't get 'em something.

14
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,113
- Where are you?
- I'm at the mall.

15
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,998
CTU knows the powder's not real.
They're going after Singer.

16
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,594
- What do you want me to do?
- Take him to containment.

17
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,510
Done.

18
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:09,397
We believe your son was infected
with the virus in Mexico early this morning.

19
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,472
We have three hours to find him
before he becomes contagious.

20
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,472
Got him. He's at Los Feliz Mall
between Vermont and Sunset.

21
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:18,074
<i>- I can land a team there in ten minutes.
- OK, fine.</i>

22
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,158
- Kyle.
- Who are you?

23
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,676
My name's Tony Almeida.
I'm a federal agent. I'm here to help you.

24
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:27,355
- I don't believe you.
- Come with me, I'll prove it to you.

25
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,832
We have an officer down.
Kyle Singer is not in custody.

26
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,349
Clear the way here, please.

27
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,192
Jack isn't picking up. Isn't Tony there?

28
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,635
I can't get through to him.
I'm trying Micah.

29
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,709
What's going on?

30
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,950
- There's been gunshots at the mall.
- When?

31
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,679
Two minutes ago. I can't get in touch
with my dad or Tony.

32
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,512
- Micah said someone's down.
- Who?

33
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:16,593
It's either Tony or Jack, he's not sure.
He's about to find out.

34
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,870
Hold on.

35
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,349
It's Jack. He wants to talk to you.

36
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,916
What's going on? Where's Tony?

37
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,672
- He's been shot.
- How bad?

38
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:38,275
He was hit in the neck. He's alive.
They're getting him to the hospital.

39
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,109
Oh, God.

40
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,512
I know how difficult this must be for you.
But you need to make a decision.

41
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,194
- What?
- With Tony down, you're in command.

42
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,716
If you wanna be by his side,
you have to hand CTU over to someone else.

43
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,030
No one will fault what you choose to do.

44
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,793
But if you choose to stay,
we need you at full capacity.

45
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,037
- I understand.
- Michelle, I'm sorry.

46
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,160
Is Tony all right?

47
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,549
They don't know yet. He was shot in the neck.

48
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,596
We're overloading the network.

49
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,877
When the virus threat came in
we stole cycles from the main CPU.

50
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:23,316
- Chloe, now is not a good time.
- What? Are you out of your mind?

51
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,709
- Just deal with it, OK?
- Michelle?

52
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:29,670
Send the archives to Division.
That should free up the network.

53
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,354
Fine. That's all I needed to know.

54
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,155
I have to get to the hospital.

55
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:39,391
The second call from
Hector Salazar's people just came in.

56
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,277
I can't deal with this now.

57
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,032
Who else is there?

58
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,793
You're the ranking agent on site.

59
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,273
Find out what hospital they took Tony to.

60
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:58,753
The second anyone knows anything
you have them patched through to me.

61
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:08,828
<i> Deliver Ramón Salazar to the
Van Nuys dam, adjacent to the 101 freeway.</i>

62
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:15,951
<i>Provide him with a full-spectrum bandwidth
radio adjusted to frequency XQ2137.</i>

63
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,634
<i>Do not attempt aerial or ground surveillance.</i>

64
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,439
<i>You have two hours from receipt
of this message to comply.</i>

65
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:25,399
<i>If you violate any one of these conditions
we will release the virus.</i>

66
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,472
- Does the encoding match the first message?
- Yeah.

67
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,757
- Can you find out where it came from?
- I can scan the frequency.

68
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,354
Maybe we'll get lucky.

69
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,876
Whoever sent this message
is controlling Kyle Singer's movements.

70
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:41,032
We have two hours to find him
before they release the virus.

71
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,435
<i>- Kyle?
- Linda, where are you?</i>

72
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,479
I'm trying to park but they're putting up
barricades. Something's going on.

73
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:55,269
No, don't go to the garage.
Meet me outside the east entrance.

74
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,672
- On Vermont?
- Yeah, go there now. I'll be there in a second.

75
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,750
<i> I've found him!</i>

76
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,955
Move over. Go!

77
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,519
- Get over!
- What's going on?

78
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,079
I don't know.

79
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,309
- Where are we going?
- We just gotta get outta here.

80
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:54,157
This is our contact frequency. If he shows up,
please let me know as soon as possible.

81
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,151
- Got it.
- Excuse me.

82
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,798
What's up?

83
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,838
Just heard about Tony. How's he doing?

84
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,749
He's on his way to the hospital.

85
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,958
- Why isn't Michelle with him?
- It'll set us back if they're both gone.

86
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,071
- Tell Michelle I'm heading over to Downey.
- To see Salazar?

87
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,993
- Yeah.
- Dad said questioning him is a waste of time.

88
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,310
Sitting around here is a waste of time.

89
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,756
Don't you think you should
clear it with Michelle first?

90
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,469
We lost the kid who's infected. If anyone
knows where he's going, it's Salazar.

91
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:41,314
- At least run it by her before you go.
- I'll call her from Downey.

92
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,436
Chase.

93
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,034
- Dessler.
- I'm looking for Tony Almeida's wife.

94
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,908
<i>- Yes, this is Michelle.
- Michelle, this is Dr Linzer.</i>

95
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,639
<i>- How is he?
- The wound to your husband's neck</i>

96
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,794
<i>is going to require some vascular repair.
We're just about to go into surgery.</i>

97
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,348
<i>- Can I talk to him?
- No, we've medicated him.</i>

98
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,671
That's why I'm calling you.
We need your consent to operate.

99
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:12,470
<i>- Yes, of course. Whatever you have to do.
- Great. Thanks.</i>

100
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:17,953
<i>- Are you sure he's gonna be OK?
- We can't be 100% certain till we get in there.</i>

101
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:21,589
<i>- But he'll be in good hands.
- Please let me know the second you finish.</i>

102
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,752
<i>I'll find you in the waiting room
when we're out of surgery.</i>

103
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:28,116
Doctor Linzer,
I will do my best to be there, but...

104
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:32,318
- you may have to reach me at this number.
- OK. We'll find you.

105
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,271
<i>- Thank you, Doctor.
- Sure.</i>

106
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:13,200
I just spoke with Anne's ex-husband.
I'm meeting him in half an hour.

107
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,033
Unless you're changing your mind.

108
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,550
I've never given in to blackmail in my life.

109
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:25,871
Considering everything
you're up against, we decided...

110
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,076
<i>I decided, Wayne.</i>

111
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,349
- It's my choice.
- And, David, you're making the right one.

112
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:39,309
Give this guy some money, he crawls back
under his rock and life will be a lot simpler.

113
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,831
For Anne too.

114
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,431
I hope so.

115
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,832
<i>- Yes?
-  I have Jack Bauer on the line, sir.</i>

116
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:58,674
<i>- Put him through.
- The president's on the line, Mr Bauer.</i>

117
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,433
<i>- Mr President? This is Jack Bauer.
- Hello, Jack.</i>

118
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:06,230
I was told Hector Salazar has given your
office instructions on delivering his brother.

119
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,150
Yes, sir.

120
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:11,199
I've also been told you might be able
to pre-empt that demand.

121
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:15,990
<i>We identified the person carrying the virus.
It was a young man named Kyle Singer.</i>

122
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,073
- Then you know where he is.
- No, sir. Unfortunately we lost him.

123
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,469
<i>Can you find him?</i>

124
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,597
Not in the time frame
that Hector Salazar has given us.

125
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:31,232
So either I hand over Ramón Salazar,
or risk that his brother will release the virus.

126
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:36,075
Mr President, I understand
that this is an impossible choice.

127
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,515
It's not a choice, Jack. Not really.

128
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:43,674
<i>This nation's policy of non-negotiation
with terrorists has been a proven deterrent.</i>

129
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,797
Capitulating to Salazar
would destroy that policy.

130
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,395
Hundreds of thousands of innocent people
may die within the week.

131
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,040
<i>More would die in the long run
if I release Salazar.</i>

132
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,237
I would be declaring open season
on the American people.

133
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:01,075
- This is your final answer, sir?
- I don't negotiate with terrorists, Jack.

134
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,719
I won't negotiate with terrorists.

135
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,110
I understand, Mr President. Thank you.

136
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,876
Conference in CDC and Health Services.

137
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:17,875
I want a full briefing on quarantine
and evacuation procedures.

138
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,871
Yes, Mr President.

139
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,351
Can you tell me where we're going?

140
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:35,910
I just gotta get outta town for a second,
figure this whole thing out.

141
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,357
- I thought you had to meet with those guys.
- Things have changed, all right?

142
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,953
What are you into, Kyle?

143
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:46,397
You ask me to steal money so these guys
won't hurt you over losing their drugs.

144
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,550
I don't think it was drugs.

145
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,756
What do you mean? What is it about?

146
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:55,038
These cops came to my apartment today
and they were saying something about...

147
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,271
using me to bring some
weird disease into the country.

148
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,998
A disease?

149
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:03,789
This cop, he was saying
that it was inside of me.

150
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,637
In your body?

151
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,917
I know. It sounds ridiculous, right?

152
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,876
Right?

153
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:18,198
Man, this whole thing is so surreal, Linda.

154
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,116
- Pull over.
- What?

155
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:25,876
- I said pull over!
- What are you doing? What are you doing?

156
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:29,431
Take the car, take the money.
I don't want any part of it.

157
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,511
Hey, Linda, chill out, OK?

158
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,673
Stay away. If you've got some disease, I don't
want it. You shouldn't have done any of this.

159
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,036
- Don't you think I know that?
- Kyle, please.

160
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,557
All right, fine. Fine, baby. You're right.
I'll stay away, OK?

161
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,995
The money's under the front seat.

162
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,957
Come on, Linda. Please.

163
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,953
Kyle, I really don't want anything
to happen to you, but I can't do this.

164
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,031
God, how stupid am I? Come on!

165
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,914
I'm sorry.

166
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,759
Go! Run! Run, Linda!

167
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,114
Go!

168
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,919
No, I have it, OK?
I have it!

169
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,399
Kyle!

170
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:18,036
<i>We have a monitoring plan for everyone
inside the quarantine zone.</i>

171
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:22,079
<i>- Define the quarantine zone.
- Everyone within two miles of ground zero.</i>

172
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,948
<i>Ground zero being the shopping center
where Kyle Singer was last seen.</i>

173
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:29,919
This is Dr Nicole Duncan with
Health Services. Medical teams are in place

174
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,596
and ready to start screening and releasing
people from quarantine over a 72-hour period.

175
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:38,559
<i>If we move quickly, we believe we can lower
the prior casualty estimate.</i>

176
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,438
- Lower it to what?
- Between 60 and 90 thousand.

177
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,672
All right, thank you. Miss Dessler, Dr Duncan.

178
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,671
Mr President.

179
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:55,196
We're about to set in motion a chain of events
that will create panic throughout the country

180
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,236
that will take some time to control.

181
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:02,838
If anyone here sees an option that
I'm overlooking, now's the time to offer it up.

182
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,990
It's Jack Bauer.

183
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:08,436
He needs to talk to you in private.
He says it's urgent.

184
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,710
Would you all excuse me for a moment?

185
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:15,429
In the meantime, I want everyone
to contact their key personnel.

186
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:18,159
Make sure they're ready to go.

187
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,591
- What is it, Jack?
- Mr President, is this line secure?

188
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,592
Yes. What do you need to tell me, Jack?

189
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:35,198
For what it's worth, sir, I agree with
your policy to not negotiate with terrorists.

190
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,874
You didn't call me to express your approval.

191
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,758
- I have another option for you.
- Another option?

192
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:45,038
Yes. One that I believe will protect
the integrity of this nation's policy.

193
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,192
- And stop this outbreak.
- And how would I do this?

194
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,714
- By simply doing nothing, sir.
- Nothing?

195
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,835
Yes, sir.

196
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,673
Hector Salazar will view that
as noncompliance.

197
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,513
- Not if he gets his brother back.
- How?

198
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,512
Ramón Salazar would be broken out
and delivered to him.

199
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:04,559
The public, and other terrorist groups,
would view this as a prison break

200
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:07,234
as opposed to a capitulation
to terrorist demands.

201
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:11,472
Sounds like quite a plan, Jack.
Who'll break Salazar out?

202
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,595
I will, sir.

203
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,877
- By yourself?
- I know the prison and the prisoner.

204
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:19,555
Because of the nature of my involvement
I could break him out and deliver him.

205
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:24,156
CTU would believe that I switched sides.
The cover story would stay clean.

206
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:29,473
- This doesn't sound like a one-man job.
- In order to protect you, it has to be.

207
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,791
I don't know, Jack.
There has to be some other way.

208
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:37,476
Not in the time that we've got. The Salazars
are gonna release the virus within two hours.

209
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:40,393
Regardless of how you contain
the initial outbreak,

210
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,837
the resulting civil unrest would far outreach
any quarantine zones established.

211
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:48,708
The damage to this country, sir,
would be catastrophic.

212
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:54,032
Mr President, I need your OK on this.

213
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:02,232
Even if you succeed, I won't be able to correct
your legal status. You'll be a fugitive.

214
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,799
I understand.

215
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:08,032
- This would be my last assignment.
- I don't know what to say.

216
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:14,195
If you don't say anything, Mr President,
I will accept that as a go for this mission.

217
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,280
Good luck, Mr President.

218
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:50,240
I want the information from Dr Duncan
sent directly to my office. My eyes only.

219
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,193
- Wayne? Where are you going?
- Excuse me.

220
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:04,990
- Wait.
- I have an appointment and I'm running late.

221
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:08,709
An appointment? The debate starts
in 30 minutes. Who are you meeting?

222
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,839
I'm sorry, but that's confidential.
It's government business.

223
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:16,549
Does this have anything
to do with my ex-husband?

224
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:21,433
Like I said, it's government business.

225
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,838
<i> Surgery. Nurses' station.</i>

226
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,708
This is Tony Almeida's wife.
I was wondering if he'd gone into surgery.

227
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,153
<i>Yes, he has.</i>

228
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,312
I wanted Dr Linzer to know
that he's allergic to penicillin.

229
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,789
<i>He's aware. The allergy card was in his wallet.</i>

230
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,871
Is there any way to know how he's doing?

231
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:58,111
<i>No, but the doctor will contact you
as soon as he's out of surgery.</i>

232
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,872
OK.

233
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,871
Thank you.

234
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,277
- Yeah?
- The site profiles are done.

235
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:11,353
- You've sent these to my system.
- I know. I wanted to come down here anyway.

236
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:14,273
- Why?
- Because of earlier.

237
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,191
What is it, Chloe?

238
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:20,831
I want you to know that I didn't know Tony
had been shot when I was insensitive earlier.

239
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:24,993
And had I known that I would have been
more careful about my choice of words, OK?

240
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,718
That's fine, Chloe.

241
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:30,873
- I do try to be aware of other people.
- I said it's fine.

242
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,757
OK.

243
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,430
- Gael?
- What?

244
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,149
We should be careful with Michelle today.
She's really sensitive.

245
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:46,277
- About Tony being shot. In the neck.
- Of course.

246
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:49,033
So make sure everyone
in your department knows.

247
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,838
<i>I've gotta take this.</i>

248
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:54,356
A personal cell? Those are prohibited.
They can't be monitored.

249
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:58,228
I'm using it for inner agency.
They'll monitor at the other end.

250
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,039
I've really gotta take this call.

251
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:08,551
Hello.

252
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,552
- When did you make the second call?
- 20 minutes ago.

253
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,837
- Are they letting Ramón go or not?
- They're still deciding.

254
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:20,278
- What are they waiting for?
- I'll let you know as soon as I hear anything.

255
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,629
I'm sorry.

256
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:56,757
It's not good to touch what's not yours.

257
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,877
- Does your sister know you're here?
- No.

258
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,150
Did you know it was loaded?

259
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,309
It is a nice gun, huh?

260
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,232
Take it, Sergio. It's OK.

261
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:31,000
You like the way it feels?

262
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:39,631
Want to pull the trigger?
Hear the noise it makes?

263
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:46,035
That is what power feels like, Sergio.
It feels like a gun.

264
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,951
Can I?

265
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,875
Sure.

266
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,190
Sure. Come on.

267
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,990
Do you see that vase down there?
OK, now, I want you to aim.

268
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:08,756
And squeeze the trigger very slowly.

269
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,510
<i>Bueno.</i>

270
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:18,434
What are you doing?
Get out of here! Go, now!

271
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,839
How many times do I have to tell you?
He's just a boy.

272
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:26,276
- Your boy needs to become a man.
- No, you're not his father.

273
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,594
What you gonna do, huh?

274
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,910
You gonna shoot me?

275
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,632
Come on. Pull the trigger.

276
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,950
Right here. Come on.

277
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,871
Get in there!

278
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,075
Hey, what is this?

279
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,040
What are you gonna do to us?

280
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,356
What is this? What are you gonna do to us?

281
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,511
Come.

282
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:04,833
We never really finished our conversation.
I was wondering what you had decided.

283
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:08,356
- Decided about what?
- The debate.

284
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:11,000
What to do about my ex-husband.

285
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:15,718
I ran into Wayne a few minutes ago.

286
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:21,033
I know he's never liked me, but this was
different. He was avoiding me, and...

287
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,998
I had a feeling I wasn't able to shake.

288
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:29,231
- What kind of feeling?
- That you're paying Ted to keep quiet.

289
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,440
Is that what you're doing, David?

290
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:40,470
Sometimes you have to do the wrong thing
for the right reason.

291
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:44,348
How can you reward someone
for threatening you with a lie? It's wrong.

292
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:47,796
There are political realities I have to consider
if I want to stay in office.

293
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:51,998
- Tell yourself that if it makes you feel better.
- It doesn't make me feel better.

294
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,799
It just happens to be the truth.

295
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:01,348
Anne, I have been in this job
for nearly four years,

296
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:06,116
and I have learned the hard way
that there are no absolutes.

297
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:09,317
- Sometimes you have to make compromises.
- Politically, yes.

298
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:13,188
But when it comes to morality...
David, you have to draw the line.

299
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:17,558
I have drawn the line.
We're just standing on different sides.

300
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,433
You're running scared.

301
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:26,433
I'm fighting to stay in office
and serve the people that put me here.

302
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:32,311
Then face Keeler's lie with the truth and
trust that the people can tell the difference.

303
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,517
- It's not that easy.
- You've never been about what's easy.

304
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,798
You've been about what's right.
That's who you are.

305
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,550
That's who the people elected to lead them.

306
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,949
For what it's worth...

307
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,638
that's who I fell in love with.

308
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,278
I was...

309
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,598
- I was trying to protect you.
- Protect me?

310
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:07,037
This won't end with Keeler's allegation.
You're gonna be in the media's cross hairs.

311
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,634
- I'm used to public scrutiny.
- Not like this.

312
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:14,271
This will be different.
And much uglier than you can imagine.

313
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,874
I can defend myself.

314
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,389
- David.
- Have you made contact with Packard?

315
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:46,278
- He just got here.
- Are you with him now?

316
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,920
He's coming over now. Why?

317
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,032
Walk away.

318
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:54,270
- What?
- You heard me.

319
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:57,272
We've been through this.
You decided to bury this, remember?

320
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,875
- I've changed my mind.
- Anne talked to you, didn't she?

321
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,029
Wayne.

322
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,589
Walk away.

323
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:44,430
- You wanted to see me?
- I've spoken to Chloe and Adam.

324
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,954
We'll cover for you
if you want to be with Tony.

325
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:50,271
- Cover for me?
- We know you've got a lot on your mind.

326
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,998
I'm fine, Gael.

327
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:58,269
I've been taking 30% of Chloe's load since the
biothreat. I can handle half of Comms as well.

328
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:02,876
We'll just need a route user password so
we won't be slowed down by authorizations.

329
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:07,431
It's Joe Tomasello's area. He put a 24-hour
delay on user mods for security.

330
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:11,115
- What if I called Joe?
- I tried that. He's unreachable.

331
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,589
Is there any other way to do this?

332
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:18,151
More bodies. We need at least four more
system-ready analysts to take on the work.

333
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,915
- I can make some calls, get the next shift in.
- I've already tried that.

334
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:27,597
By the time they got here it would be too late.
I appreciate this, but it's not gonna happen.

335
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:30,353
So let's get back to work.

336
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,077
Michelle.

337
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:42,471
Listen, I agree. We can't run this place
by committee. Let me step in for you.

338
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:45,154
- Adam and Chloe stay at their posts.
- What about yours?

339
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:48,835
At Langley I filled in for my bureau chief
a couple of times.

340
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:53,391
Was there a biothreat?
President in town? All in one day?

341
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:56,109
Thank you anyway, Gael.

342
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:06,154
- CTU. Bauer.
- Kim, what are you doing right now?

343
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,755
Trying to locate the origin of
that phone call from Salazar's people.

344
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:13,389
- I need you to do something for me first.
- What?

345
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:16,552
I need you to generate
a prisoner transfer document.

346
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,189
Look in File Form under the heading
"Federal Transit Authorization".

347
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,032
What's this about?

348
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:25,990
- I need to move Ramón Salazar.
- Why are you gonna move him?

349
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:29,755
Kim, this has priority clearance.
No one at CTU's supposed to know.

350
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:33,913
That's why you're the only person I can trust
to do this for me. So please, help.

351
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,389
OK. It's asking for a clearance code.

352
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,516
Hit *99.

353
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,397
Now it wants a password.

354
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,869
Lincoln65fga.

355
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:53,871
- OK, it's cycling. It's gonna take a minute.
- OK, good.

356
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,038
Look, Kim.

357
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:02,274
I know you came up to my office earlier
to talk about something important to you.

358
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:05,557
- I wasn't very supportive. I wanted to...
- You don't have to do this.

359
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:08,996
Sweetheart, I do. I need to tell you I'm sorry.

360
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:13,233
I know that I'm overly protective of you.

361
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:16,073
I've watched so many things
happen to you, I...

362
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:19,197
I don't want you to get hurt any more.

363
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:23,319
But the fact is, I trust you.
I trust your judgment.

364
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:28,793
I need you to know that anything you ever
chose to do, I would support you in. OK?

365
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,394
Thanks. That means a lot to me.

366
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,438
Good.

367
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,948
I love you so much, Kim.

368
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,429
I love you too, Dad.

369
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,553
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm all right. Is the document up yet?

370
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:51,597
- Yeah.
- Send it to Warden Mitchell, over at Downey.

371
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:55,309
- Done.
- OK, good. Let me speak to Chase.

372
00:28:56,920 --> 00:29:00,833
- He's not here.
- What are you talking about? Where is he?

373
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,871
Where is Chase?

374
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:07,873
- He went to interrogate Salazar.
- Chase is at the prison now?

375
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:11,714
He left about 15 minutes ago.
He's gonna be there soon.

376
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:14,268
I'm gonna have to get back to you.

377
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,713
Son of a bitch!

378
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,314
<i>- Yeah?
- Chase, what are you doing?</i>

379
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:28,233
- I'm going to talk to Salazar.
- Get back to CTU now!

380
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:33,189
- And do what? Filing? Maybe some dusting?
- No, work with Michelle and find Kyle Singer.

381
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,475
She's got a dozen IT people on that right now.

382
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:38,199
- Listen to me.
- No, listen to me, Jack.

383
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:42,353
I know you're angry about me and Kim, but
I won't let you stop me from doing my job.

384
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:45,000
Your job is to follow my orders!

385
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,548
You're in no condition to give me orders.

386
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:51,519
Chase, I'm warning you. Don't go against me.

387
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:55,639
Jack, look. You know I respect you,
but you also know I've been covering for you.

388
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:59,554
I've been keeping the fact that you're a junkie
from Kim and everybody else.

389
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:02,200
I'm not doing it any more.
I'm done.

390
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:04,271
Chase! Chase!

391
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,869
Dammit!

392
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:12,279
Get this guy processed
and get him outta here.

393
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,438
Agent Edmunds.

394
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:20,196
- Warden. I need to see Salazar.
- I've got a lot going on right now.

395
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:23,431
I'll follow up with authorization,
but I need to see Salazar now.

396
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,592
Salazar's been behind two murders today.
No one gets close.

397
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:30,639
You don't know what's happening today.
Salazar has information that I need.

398
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,358
- What information?
- Classified.

399
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:35,159
This is my facility. I need to know.

400
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:40,718
We're dealing with a major terrorist threat.
Salazar's brother is behind it.

401
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,075
Confirm it with Division if you want to.

402
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,628
But hundreds of thousands
of lives are at stake.

403
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:48,996
Jack and I have been here twice a week
for the last three months.

404
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:53,278
Salazar has prevented us from doing our job
with his lawyers and his due process.

405
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,954
We don't have time for that.

406
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:59,032
I need to go one-on-one with him. Right now.

407
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,630
He's in an isolation cell in B block.
Come on, I'll take you.

408
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,393
- Cameras?
- There are three.

409
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:18,233
- Need 'em turned off.
- It's against regulations.

410
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:22,393
- There won't be any marks. I promise.
- You've got 30 minutes.

411
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:31,595
This is Warden Mitchell.
I need you to go black on Isolation B.

412
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:35,389
<i>-  For how long, sir?
- Until further notice.</i>

413
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,910
You are a tough guy, huh?

414
00:31:56,120 --> 00:32:00,511
You are not worried what may happen
if you lay a finger on me?

415
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,318
OK.

416
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,789
If you're not worried, neither am I.

417
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,470
Let me know when you start to worry.

418
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:31,911
- Where's Kyle Singer?
- I told you, I don't know.

419
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,673
You're gonna tell me who does.

420
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,676
<i> Chase!</i>

421
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,990
Put him in his cell.

422
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,269
- What are you doing here?
- We ran out of options.

423
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:51,557
We can't find Singer.
Salazar's our only hope. You were right.

424
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:54,438
He's tougher than I thought.
Maybe two of us can...

425
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:57,557
Look, Jack. About what I said before...

426
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:03,472
- Forget about it.
- So we're OK? You and me?

427
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,714
Yeah, we're OK.

428
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:12,236
- Tell me about the security cameras.
- They're disabled.

429
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,834
Good. Get him out of his cell.

430
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:37,639
Are you gonna kill me now, Jack?

431
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,789
I'd love to. But I can't.

432
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:45,238
If you play this cool,
you're walking out of here now.

433
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:50,599
You'll be with your brother in the next
couple of hours. Now grab his feet.

434
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:04,669
Turn and face the wall.

435
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:29,959
How are you gonna feel, Anne,
if David loses this election because of you?

436
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,634
I don't think that's very likely.

437
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:37,513
Then you really don't know
what you're talking about.

438
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:42,071
This allegation may cost him this debate.
David needs this debate to win this election.

439
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:44,879
- It was blackmail.
- And David made a decision to pay.

440
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,679
It wasn't up to you to change his mind.

441
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:52,319
If he believed the decision was right,
he wouldn't have changed his mind.

442
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:57,269
The problem is you can't stand the fact
that your brother wants me in his life.

443
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:01,239
Because you're a distraction, Anne.
And you're a liability.

444
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,836
Compared to whom? Sherry?

445
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:09,316
I'm not gonna defend Sherry. She went off the
rails. But at least she understood the game.

446
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,914
She understood David.
She was with him over 20 years.

447
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,994
- I know the kind of man he is.
- You don't know anything about him.

448
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:20,993
Or what it takes to survive
in the world he lives in.

449
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,718
We disagree, Wayne. We always have.

450
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:30,397
Anne, I will not stand by and watch you
jeopardize everything he's worked for.

451
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,911
I won't do it.

452
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:38,428
I don't scare easily.

453
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,989
After all you went through to put me here,
I can't believe you'd let me out.

454
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,195
Shut up.

455
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:15,559
I don't believe you sold out. It's not your
nature. But then, why knock out the kid?

456
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:20,555
Did your government cave, but can't admit it?
Is that what happened?

457
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:24,717
You don't look so good, Jack. That's a bitch.

458
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:30,511
You wanna get outta here? You keep your
mouth shut and do what I say, understand?

459
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,758
We've been cleared to pass.

460
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:36,593
The warden wants to see you first.
He'll be here in a minute.

461
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:38,511
OK.

462
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:58,118
Don't you move.

463
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,156
Sorry to keep you waiting, Jack.

464
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,993
- What's the problem?
- The codes on this transfer order.

465
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,469
They don't correspond to the ones assigned.

466
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:09,109
Division superseded those access codes.
CTU has a mandated prefix.

467
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:12,988
- This is yesterday's prefix.
- Son of a bitch.

468
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:17,517
Someone in my office screwed up.
We'll get you the proper prefix retroactively.

469
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:22,712
Look, I know about the terrorist threat.
Agent Edmunds told me.

470
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,314
That's why we need to move
the prisoner now.

471
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:28,039
It's classified. Priority one.
I couldn't tell you.

472
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:32,033
But I can't afford to lose time
over some technical detail.

473
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:35,351
- Come on, Kevin, help me out.
- Where's Agent Edmunds?

474
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,955
He's searching the prisoner's cell,
trying to find information.

475
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:43,397
He'll be right behind me.
He can help you out with the paperwork.

476
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:46,040
All right. Pick up your badge
and gun at Receiving.

477
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:48,031
Thanks. I owe you.

478
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,911
Move.

479
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,800
Turn on Isolation 3, please.

480
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,672
What the hell...?

481
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:29,233
Someone turned the camera. The angle's
wrong. Get Benjamin to meet me in Isolation.

482
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,231
Door.

483
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,991
Face the wall.

484
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,390
Agent Bauer.
Here to get my gun and my badge.

485
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,991
Open it.

486
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,956
Door!

487
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:22,119
- Kinda hot today.
- Yeah, buddy.

488
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:28,197
Whatever Bauer told you, he's lying!
Come on!

489
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,958
- One minute, I'll check you out.
- OK.

490
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,037
Daniel, I'm back on post.

491
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:52,349
<i>- Move!
-  Code 4. We have full lockdown.</i>

492
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,670
<i>Code 4. Full lockdown.</i>

493
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,594
<i> Security breach.
We have lock on all blocks.</i>

494
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:01,399
<i>Security breach.
Lock on all blocks.</i>

495
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:05,674
- Open the cell blocks now.
- I can't do it from here.

496
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,035
Is it worth losing your life over?

497
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,314
Do it now!

498
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:39,957
- Hey, this is what I'm talking about!
- Yeah!

499
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,311
- Come on!
- Yeah!

500
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,313
<i> Full lockdown.
Code 4. We have full lockdown.</i>
