1
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:18,120
Right now, terrorists are plotting
to assassinate a presidential candidate.

2
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,560
My wife and daughter have been targeted.

3
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,760
And people that I work with
may be involved in both.

4
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:30,840
I'm Federal Agent Jack Bauer,
and today is the longest day of my life.

5
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:38,360
- You just gave your concession speech.
- That remains to be seen.

6
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:43,120
I only hope your conscience comforts you
when you finally realise this is all over.

7
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,240
You mean the campaign or us?

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,200
I saw the car explode. I lost my daughter!

9
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:53,040
Kim is alive. She got out
before the explosion. I talked to her.

10
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,920
I'm gonna stick you
back in the holding cell.

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,400
Maybe that'll convince you
not to screw around.

12
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,200
Call this number. Tell them that I am
Jack Bauer's daughter and that I'm here.

13
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,520
Ask them if they think I'm screwing around.

14
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,000
This is a prison facility. Why are you here?

15
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,600
The people that want Palmer dead
bribed someone from the power company.

16
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,360
Something's gonna happen here.

17
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:17,440
A prisoner's being delivered by chopper.
His identity's classified, even from me.

18
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,680
- That's impossible.
- You recognise him?

19
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,840
That's Victor Drazen,
the man I killed two years ago.

20
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,640
- You haven't heard from your brother?
- You seem anxious, Harris.

21
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,360
Just get your men ready. It's time.

22
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:35,400
The idea is to get my father out of prison.
This is the best chance we'll ever have.

23
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,400
Get against the wall.

24
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,600
They are here.

25
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:00,880
Well, it's official. The polls have just
closed in California, and the big story:

26
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,040
Senator David Palmer
seems to have swept California

27
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:07,280
and every other state that held
a primary this Super Tuesday.

28
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:12,640
It looks like he may have gotten a late boost
based on the roller-coaster events of his day.

29
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,680
Earlier, the senator held a press conference
to disclose the details of a scandal

30
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,920
involving both his son
and his primary financial backers.

31
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,880
Palmer claims to have been
unaware of any wrongdoing...

32
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,640
You're in my seat.

33
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,920
Fine.

34
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,240
I said, that's my seat.

35
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:48,040
- And how about you?
- Would you excuse us for a moment?

36
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,800
Thanks a lot.

37
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:53,360
11 for 11, my friend.
Congratulations. You did it.

38
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,640
We did it.

39
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:59,680
That's not the best part.
Fox News just did an instant poll.

40
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,320
83 per cent approved of the way
you handled the Ferragamo situation.

41
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,720
Boy, that is great!

42
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,000
- Have we heard from Ames or his people?
- They're all too busy running for cover.

43
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,240
We don't wanna get cocky, but so far
it couldn't have turned out better.

44
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,440
Everyone, listen up.

45
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,320
In a bit, I'm going to give
a speech to the country.

46
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,720
We have a number of primaries
in the coming months,

47
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,040
so technically it's not a victory speech.

48
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:41,120
But I'm gonna make it
sound like one anyway.

49
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:50,080
Now, as you know, in many ways
this has been a difficult day for my family.

50
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,400
And I am confident that being open
and honest was the right thing to do,

51
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:58,360
and that things will be resolved
fairly for everyone concerned.

52
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:03,320
And, in the meantime, I wanna thank
everyone in this room for their support.

53
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,960
- This is our victory.
- Yeah!

54
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:12,320
- This is our night.
- Yeah!

55
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,560
And I just wanna give one last order,

56
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:19,400
which will be obeyed with
no exceptions whatsoever.

57
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,480
Enjoy the rest of the evening.

58
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,320
Division wants an update
on the Palmer threat assessment.

59
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,120
With Alexis under control,
that threat may be minimal.

60
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,240
Nina, it's your line.

61
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:37,360
- Go ahead.
- Do what you can to get everyone together.

62
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,360
- It's Bauer.
- I got it.

63
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,680
- What the hell's goin' on?
- Listen up.

64
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:49,520
The field we were standing in is hiding
an underground detention facility.

65
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,280
It's being used as a prison
to house Victor Drazen.

66
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,640
You said you took him out two years ago.

67
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,440
Apparently not. I'm staring at him. There's
a team in place. They're ready to attack us.

68
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,360
They've already cut off the power.
I need you to send in a field unit now!

69
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:08,000
- George, what are you gonna do?
- All right, I'll call Division.

70
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,920
By the time you get approval,
this whole thing'll be over.

71
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,280
If Victor Drazen escapes, it'll be our fault.
George, you know what this man can do.

72
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,600
You decide.

73
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,040
What's going on?

74
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,800
Dispatch a field unit to the location
in Saugus. I'll clear it from my end.

75
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,600
- Get ahold of Chapelle immediately.
- What is going on? Is Jack all right?

76
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,080
It is such a shame. You're wasting
the best years of your life on a married man.

77
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,400
- George...
- And picking up Almeida on the rebound?

78
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:47,760
- That is out of line.
- No, you're outta line. Think about it.

79
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,840
I'm just tryin' to be a friend here.

80
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:55,160
- George, just tell me if he's...
- Nina, where's Jack?

81
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,920
Teri, thank God you're OK.

82
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,080
- Any word on Kim?
- No, not yet. But we're working on it.

83
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:07,480
- I need to talk to Jack.
- He's not here. He's on assignment.

84
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,240
On assignment?
Has he been told what happened to us?

85
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,240
- Well, not yet.
- Why not?

86
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,480
- Because we can't get ahold of him.
- Get ahold of him now.

87
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,480
- Teri, I'm sorry. It's just not possible.
- Nina, I want to talk to Jack.

88
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:24,560
Jack's in a situation where he needs our
support. We're doing everything we can.

89
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,360
- What kind of situation?
- That's all I can tell you right now.

90
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,880
I need you to tell me everything that
happened at your house before Tony arrived.

91
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,800
I already told Tony everything.

92
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:42,600
But it won't hurt to go over it again. Any
details will help us, and they will help Jack.

93
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:49,480
All right, but I need to know
what's going on with my family.

94
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:53,320
I know, and I promise I'll give you
an update as soon as I have one.

95
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,680
All right?

96
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,720
Stand against the door.

97
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,280
Lawrence, what's goin' on out there?

98
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,720
Lawrence, do you copy?

99
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,320
Ray, this is DeSalvo. Come in.

100
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,520
- Ray!
- We gotta get out of here. Which way?

101
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,160
The flood egress is to the right.

102
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,640
Open the door slowly.

103
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:32,000
Step out into the middle of the hall.

104
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,960
Turn to your right.

105
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,040
Keep moving.

106
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:03,000
Lawrence, where are you?
Lawrence, do you copy?

107
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:06,480
We have to get out of this hallway.
We're too exposed.

108
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,920
All right. What's the plan?
How are they gonna break you outta here?

109
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,880
You son of a bitch, if any of my men die...

110
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,720
What area of this building
is most defendable?

111
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:29,600
- Let's get outta here. Move.
- Fall back. Defend the retreat.

112
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,680
Turn around.

113
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:53,560
I've been trying to get ahold of Chapelle.
Whatever he's doing, this is more important.

114
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:59,200
Well, for starters, I sent a CTU field unit
over to a DOD facility.

115
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:02,560
- I need to have some unity of command.
- I can give him a message.

116
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,080
All right. Just get him
to call me as soon as you can.

117
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,920
Mrs. Bauer.

118
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,160
- Teri.
- Mason. I thought you were being debriefed.

119
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:14,840
Nina won't tell me anything,
and I need to know what's going on with Kim.

120
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:18,880
I'm afraid I don't know any more
than Nina does, but I'm sure Kim's safe.

121
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,480
Well, I wish I could believe that, but...
Based on what?

122
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:27,800
I haven't been fully briefed, but the man that
attacked you asked where she was, right?

123
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,680
- Yes.
- So that means they're lookin' for her, too.

124
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,720
As time passes it gets
harder for them and easier for us.

125
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:39,120
There's only a few of them, whereas we can
cover the whole city. And believe me, we are.

126
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,840
Jack is extremely important to all of us here,

127
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,600
and nobody's gonna rest easy until your
daughter's back with you, safe and sound.

128
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,600
Thank you.

129
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,920
Just doin' my job.

130
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,840
- Mason?
- George, it's Nina.

131
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,520
Uh-huh?

132
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,960
Our unit will be on site in 15 minutes. They
wanna know who's in command, us or DOD.

133
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,320
- We are. Let me know when they're on site.
- All right.

134
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,360
Was that about Jack?

135
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:16,480
We got a lot of things goin' on. As soon as
we get word from Jack, we'll let you know.

136
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,880
You've been very kind.

137
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:22,960
I'll have my assistant Rebecca look after you.
You let her know if you need anything, OK?

138
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,840
Do me a favour, keep your chin up, all right?

139
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,960
- Rebecca.
- Yeah?

140
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,640
I'm sending Jack's wife down.
Baby-sit her for me.

141
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,600
OK. What do you want me to do with her?

142
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,680
Whatever. I don't care what you do with her.
Just keep her out of my face, OK?

143
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,080
Got it.

144
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:50,280
- Where's Patty?
- She's finishing up your speech.

145
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,560
Hold that for me. I'll be right back.

146
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,160
- Senator.
- Congratulations.

147
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:02,200
- Looks like you're going to the White House.
- We'll know by the end of the day.

148
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:05,240
- Hey, we missed you out there.
- Hi.

149
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:09,800
I'm just going through it one last time.

150
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,720
I made the changes you asked for.

151
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,640
Oh, yeah. That's much better.

152
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,280
I'm glad you like it.

153
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I can't believe you won all 11 primaries.

154
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,560
You and your family must be so happy.

155
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,280
Yeah, we are.

156
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,240
- Are you OK?
- Yeah. Yeah, it's just all catchin' up with me.

157
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,920
It's been a long day.

158
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:56,200
You know what, Patty? Why don't we
move the second paragraph to the end?

159
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,840
That'll close with the note about party unity.

160
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,080
That's a good idea.

161
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,640
- Uh, Senator?
- Yes, Patty?

162
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,720
There's, um, something
I've been wanting to tell you,

163
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:15,200
but every time I start
it just seems inappropriate.

164
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:19,640
- What is it?
- Well, it's just that, um...

165
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,840
I wanted to tell you how much I admire you.

166
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:32,080
I don't see very many people who stand by
their principles the way that you do.

167
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:36,200
And I truly believe our country
would be a better place with you leading it.

168
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,440
Well!

169
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,240
- What is it?
- Nothing. I'm just a little flustered.

170
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,400
What a wonderful
and unexpected compliment.

171
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:59,880
Well, I'll just switch those paragraphs.

172
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,160
All right.

173
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,760
Barnes, this is Mason. What's your 20?

174
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:19,040
We're approaching the site.

175
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,040
What's going on down there? Barnes?

176
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,960
Looks like the door's been blown in.

177
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,480
- Are the hostiles inside?
- They must be.

178
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,920
No activity here. We're preparing to go in.

179
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,560
Take cover! Take cover!

180
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,200
- Father!
- Andre!

181
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,640
Get down or I'll shoot him!

182
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,200
- Let him go!
- Let my father go!

183
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,640
Drop your weapons!

184
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,920
- Stay back or I will shoot him!
- You don't stand a chance!

185
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,320
- Andre!
- Drop it now. You're surrounded!

186
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,480
Back off! Drop your weapons or I will shoot!

187
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,120
Let my father go right now or this man dies.

188
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,080
- Drop your weapons!
- I'll kill him.

189
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,720
Don't do it, Bauer! Don't release that prisoner.

190
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,720
Drop your weapons or I will shoot him!
Drop your weapons!

191
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,480
- Don't do it, Bauer!
- Drop it! I'll give you three seconds.

192
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,520
One.

193
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,720
Two.

194
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,280
The weapon's up!

195
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,480
No!

196
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:38,240
- Father!
- Andre!

197
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:45,080
- Where is Alexis?
- He's been out of touch for some time.

198
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,640
We have to assume the worst.

199
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,920
- Hostiles outside the main entrance.
- How many?

200
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,040
At least a dozen, all well-armed.

201
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,360
Collapse the corridor immediately.

202
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,040
Let's hustle, men. Down here. Down here.

203
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:09,600
Take him. We may need him
as a bargaining chip.

204
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,480
Go, go, go!

205
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,200
That was a mistake. Now you're trapped.

206
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,280
We will see.

207
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,920
I told you, don't mess with me.

208
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,480
You got something that belongs to me
and you better give it up now.

209
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:54,400
- I ain't got nothin'.
- We cool. I'm your friend.

210
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,960
We cool if you and your girls back off.

211
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,360
You holdin' out on me? You a bad girl.

212
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,480
When we get outta here,
maybe I'll mess you up like that.

213
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:28,040
- What is your problem?
- You.

214
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:31,720
Me? I'm only in here because
you told the cops I was a part of the deal.

215
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:35,680
- You were a part of the deal.
- I didn't even know it was happening.

216
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,080
Nobody told you to come over.

217
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,920
- If this is about Rick...
- Rick? You think I care about that loser?

218
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,320
- He's not a loser.
- He kidnaps you, and you defend him?

219
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,520
- He didn't know what was going on.
- Like I said, he's a loser.

220
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,800
What are you shaking your head for?

221
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,280
You're Daddy's little girl.
You get everything handed to you.

222
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:59,280
Shut up! I have been listening
to this crap all day.

223
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:03,600
About how I get everything I want, and how
my life is great and everyone else's sucks.

224
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:06,880
Wanna know something?
You don't know anything about me.

225
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,480
Last night I was kidnapped, tied up in a trunk,

226
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:12,320
and then I got to see your friend Dan
get shot in the head.

227
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:17,480
Take all the bad luck you've had, it wouldn't
fit into half of what's happened to me today.

228
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:20,320
So messing me up
may not be as easy as you think.

229
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:26,520
But if you wanna try, bring it on -
here, outside, any place you like.

230
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,040
You think I am a monster

231
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:13,400
because I want revenge on your wife
and daughter as well as on you.

232
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,840
You were a monster
long before you ever heard of me.

233
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:21,000
Oh, I see. You consider yourself informed.

234
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:26,160
You have read magazines.
You have studied intelligence reports,

235
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:31,200
filed by people who tell their superiors
only what they want to hear.

236
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,360
And you have the audacity to judge me?

237
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,840
When does your suffering end, Victor?

238
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:42,720
After you've killed me and Senator Palmer
and all the thousands of enemies you have?

239
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:46,000
Yes. Simple, is it not?

240
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,440
You're insane. It's a psychotic fantasy.

241
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:03,200
A fantasy which is coming
closer and closer to a reality.

242
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,160
This is Victor Drazen.
Whom am I speaking to?

243
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:15,160
This is George Mason. I'm the district
director of the Counter Terrorist Unit.

244
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:18,360
You will be the person
I will be negotiating with?

245
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:24,040
Negative. We do not negotiate with terrorists.
I'm willing to listen to your concerns.

246
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:27,920
My main concern is Jack Bauer.

247
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
- Do you know him?
- Yes, I know him.

248
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,480
Do you want to see him alive again?

249
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,200
How do I know he's alive?

250
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,280
- George.
- Yeah, it's me.

251
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,240
I've counted six of them.
They've got assault rifles.

252
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,360
As you hear, he is alive.

253
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,800
I'll be speaking with my superiors
and I'll get back to you.

254
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:58,320
Drazen's taken command of the facility.
He's got Jack. There's at least six of them.

255
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:03,560
They've got assault weapons, explosives.
Get that information to the field unit.

256
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,920
Bring up the layout of the facility.

257
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,960
How did Jack sound?

258
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,040
Alive.

259
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,920
- It's gonna be a long drawn-out process.
- I know the drill.

260
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,440
And you know it may not turn out well.

261
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:23,280
If you want me to put somebody who's
less emotionally involved on this, I will.

262
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,400
I can do my job, George.

263
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,760
OK.

264
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
- Any word from Chapelle?
- I still can't get ahold of him.

265
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:41,320
Unbelievable. Hope that bastard doesn't
plan on blaming me if things go wrong.

266
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,520
- Take it.
- No way.

267
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,600
- I said take it.
- No.

268
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,200
Who's smokin' pot?

269
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,800
- That one.
- She threw it at me.

270
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,920
Bitch! Why you lyin'?

271
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,160
Give it to me.

272
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,640
Give it to me!

273
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,200
- And who are you?
- I swear it wasn't me.

274
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:39,200
Oh, you're comin' with me.

275
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,480
She's telling the truth.

276
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,360
- Don't make a liar outta me, blondie.
- No need. You are one.

277
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,840
I didn't do nothing! Get off me!

278
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:10,360
I'm gonna get you back,
blondie, don't you worry!

279
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,640
Officer?

280
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,840
Wait.

281
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:22,400
I wanna talk to the cop who busted me today.
I think his name is Krugman.

282
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,400
- You wanna talk to him about what?
- What happened tonight.

283
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:30,560
He wants to know about it,
so tell him that I'm ready to talk.

284
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,600
Come on.

285
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:50,080
Two years ago in Kosovo

286
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:54,520
the man who went into the building
before the explosion obviously wasn't you.

287
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,600
- You were using a double.
- A common technique.

288
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:02,000
I am surprised your people
were fooled by it.

289
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,360
- That's not my point, Victor.
- What is your point, Jack?

290
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:11,160
You were using a double.
That means you thought you were a target.

291
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:15,480
When you let that man near your family,
you put them in danger.

292
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:18,360
You're responsible for their deaths.

293
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:23,160
They were away on a trip.
My daughter was ill.

294
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,800
They returned one day earlier than expected.

295
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:34,000
But, yes, I should have been more careful.

296
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,480
Father, are you all right?

297
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:52,280
Over the last two years

298
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:58,080
I have accepted my share of responsibility
for the death of my family.

299
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:02,280
This is the day...

300
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:05,680
you accept your share.

301
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:12,000
Come, Dada.

302
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,520
Make sure he does not die.

303
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,200
Come.

304
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,520
Is this what you wanted?

305
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,600
Mm-hm. Much better.

306
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,520
- Senator?
- Yeah, Elaine?

307
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:03,080
- Mike says they're ready for you downstairs.
- Tell him I'll be down in 20 minutes.

308
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:07,400
- Do you have a copy for the TelePrompTer?
- Uh, it's this one.

309
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:10,360
All but the last page.

310
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,640
OK. Thanks.

311
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,640
Would you like to be left alone?

312
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:18,280
No. You can work in here if you want.

313
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,600
I'm sorry.

314
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,680
What is it?

315
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:55,200
It's just that I feel bad that
this day's been tainted for you.

316
00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:00,760
Don't feel bad for me.
It's Keith and Nicole who have been suffering.

317
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,280
Excuse me for saying this,
but you do that too much.

318
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:07,640
- Do what?
- You worry about everybody else.

319
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:10,000
Who takes care of you?

320
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,920
You all take care of me.

321
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:19,240
No. We all wantto, but planning
schedules and writing speeches

322
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,400
isn't taking care of someone.

323
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,200
I'm fine, Patty.

324
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:41,160
Just relax.

325
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,480
You need this.

326
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,200
Oh, that does feel good.

327
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,240
I appreciate it, Patty.

328
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,240
I really do.

329
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,920
But if I get too comfortable,
I may not get off this couch.

330
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,520
Yeah, well, uh...

331
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:24,600
I'll just go prepare tomorrow's briefing
with Mike. Excuse me.

332
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,720
- CTU. Myers.
- Chapelle calling for Mason.

333
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,960
Yes. I'll put you through.

334
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,400
- Mason.
- It's Chapelle.

335
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,560
Ryan, I've been tryin'
to reach you for a half-hour.

336
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:58,000
Yeah. Well, I've been getting
reamed by DOD and the Pentagon.

337
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,080
But I think I've managed
to untangle the mess you've made.

338
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:03,760
What are you talking about?

339
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,520
You should have kept Bauer
on a tighter leash, a lot tighter.

340
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:11,160
- I'm not in love with the guy, but he delivers.
- Oh, really?

341
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:15,840
Let's face it, if it wasn't for Jack,
Victor Drazen would have escaped,

342
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:19,560
which would have been embarrassing
for some, if I'm not mistaken.

343
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,840
- You're very mistaken.
- I beg your pardon?

344
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:24,800
Come on, George. Think it through.

345
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:29,880
Drazen wasn't officially a prisoner, right?
So he couldn't officially escape.

346
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:33,000
It wouldn't have embarrassed anyone.
It would have been...

347
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:35,280
- A nonevent.
- Exactly.

348
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:39,280
Instead, we have an assault team out there
with all kinds of people in the loop.

349
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:43,000
Soon the cops'll get wind of it,
and then, God forbid, the press.

350
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,760
You wanna talk about embarrassing?

351
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:51,760
Now, we have to end this thing. And
I'm not talking hours, I'm talking minutes.

352
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,680
What about Bauer?

353
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,920
Nobody asked him to go out there tonight.

354
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,400
Now, get on with it,
or I'll find someone who will.

355
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,840
Yeah?

356
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,320
I'm gonna have to order a full assault,
starting in about five minutes.

357
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:23,840
Team's making their final preparations.

358
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,600
I'm sorry.

359
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,200
Teri, it's Tony. Can you pick up?

360
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,920
- Hello?
- Look, we've found Kim.

361
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,040
She's fine. She's in a precinct.
They're bringing her over.

362
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:49,360
- Are you sure she's OK? Can I talk to her?
- We'll put you through as soon as we can.

363
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,440
OK. You patch her through
as soon as she calls.

364
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,160
- Thank you.
- OK.

365
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,920
- They found Kim.
- They did?

366
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,440
- Yeah.
- That's great.

367
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,400
I'm so relieved.

368
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,400
Um...

369
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,720
Teri, I have some information about Jack.

370
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,760
Why don't you sit down?

371
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:23,920
We think he may have been captured by
the same group that was after you and Kim.

372
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,040
Oh, my God!

373
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:32,800
I know that sounds bad,
but we have rescue teams on the site,

374
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,240
and the people who have Jack
have been completely surrounded.

375
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:47,840
Teri... I know Jack.

376
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:52,440
I know he will get out of this.

377
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:04,000
I knew you'd want to be told.

378
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:35,640
Team One is inside.
Repeat: Team One is inside.

379
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,920
Charges are in place. We are good to go.

380
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:48,320
- Yeah?
- This is it.

381
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,760
- All right.
- What about Bauer?

382
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:03,320
Just make sure you get Drazen. Go.

383
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,560
Hit it.

384
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,000
Go! Go!

385
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,920
Kimberly.

386
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,960
- What is it?
- We're releasing you.

387
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:44,280
- Did you speak to my dad?
- No, but I talked to the people he works with.

388
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:53,240
Melanie told me she lied before. She admitted
you had nothing to do with the drug deal.

389
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:56,520
So I called the number you gave me,
and everything checked out.

390
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:00,120
- Sounds like you had a tough day.
- Yeah. Did you speak to my mom?

391
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,400
- She's waiting at CTU.
- Are you serious?

392
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,000
I'm serious. I'm gonna drive you there myself.

393
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,120
- Ready?
- I think so.

394
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,920
- Would you do me a favour, David?
- What's that, Mike?

395
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,080
Smile.

396
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:19,560
Not a politician's smile, a real one.

397
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,800
You've been through hell today,
but you've come through it.

398
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:27,480
And tomorrow morning the fight starts again.

399
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:30,560
But tonight you need to celebrate.

400
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:32,600
I'll be fine, Mike.

401
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,680
Let go of it, just for a little bit.

402
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,320
I can't.

403
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:42,400
This thing with Keith is just beginning.

404
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:47,560
And as for Sherry and me? You've had a
front-row seat today. You know it's not good.

405
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,840
Let me explain something to you.

406
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:56,480
Once you're in the White House,
everything defers to the office.

407
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:00,160
It's what you need to do the job.

408
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,880
If it's your marriage that helps you...
that's great.

409
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:10,880
But if not... well, that's OK, too.

410
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:17,440
You can have whatever you want, David.

411
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:27,200
All right, Mike. Let's go.

412
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,960
Report.

413
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,920
One dead body.

414
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,680
No hostiles. Sector One secure.

415
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:06,560
Sector Two secure. One dead body.
Appears to be the warden - DeSalvo.

416
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:09,120
No hostiles.

417
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,040
Drake, this is Mason.
What's goin' on down there?

418
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,520
The entire staff,
including the warden, is dead.

419
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:17,840
But Drazen's gone, and so
is anyone else who was here.

420
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:29,800
Looks like they broke through another wall.
Some sort of tunnel.

421
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:32,760
- Maybe an old sewer system.
- Follow them.

422
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:42,920
Drake?

423
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,200
Drake?

424
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:49,160
It's booby-trapped. Laser mines.

425
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,040
- Can you disarm?
- Given time.

426
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:54,320
How much?

427
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,880
About a half-hour.

428
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:02,360
Do what you can.

429
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:10,720
Get your hands back on your head.

430
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,400
Well done.

431
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:24,240
Father, we have less than
three hours left. Get down.

432
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,560
Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.

433
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:30,000
I will offer you one consolation.

434
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:34,480
Your family will be joining you soon.

435
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,640
Your son Alexis -
do you wanna see him again?

436
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,920
- Alexis is dead.
- No, he's not. We've got him.

437
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,440
You are lying.

438
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:47,520
How else would I know that he was
supposed to meet with one of Palmer's staff,

439
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:52,640
a woman named Elizabeth Nash,
in room 1243 at 4.30 this afternoon?

440
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:56,680
- Yeah, that much is true.
- We captured him. I know where he is.

441
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,840
Get him in!

442
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,400
- Can I borrow your phone?
- Oh, yeah.

443
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:49,240
- Hello?
- Hey, Mom. It's me.

444
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,520
- Hi, honey.
- Can't wait to see you.

445
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:54,440
I can't wait to see you.
I'm glad you're OK. I thought...

446
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:57,360
I know. I thought they had you again.

447
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:01,800
- How did you end up in jail?
- I'll tell you when I get there. Where's Dad?

448
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:08,080
He's not here. He's working.
I'm hoping he'll call in very soon.

449
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:13,360
I love you so much, Mom. And I'm
gonna be there in a few minutes, OK?

450
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,360
I love you too, honey.

451
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,880
- Bye.
- Bye.

452
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,920
Thanks.

453
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:43,800
- I'm real sorry about not believin' you at first.
- Don't worry. Not sure if I believe it myself.

454
