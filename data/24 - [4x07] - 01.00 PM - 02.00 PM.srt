1
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:19,953
- Stand down!
- Step back or I'll kill her.

2
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:23,476
- Put your gun down now.
- Step back! I'll kill her!

3
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,278
I will kill her!

4
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,754
When I was inside,
I recognised one of the men.

5
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,556
Who?

6
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,200
I can't place him,
but I know that I saw him before today.

7
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:40,438
Why did they think you were
holding something back from them?

8
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:44,991
But I am not going to tell these people things
about my private life they don't need to know.

9
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,548
That you don't <i>think</i> they need to know.

10
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,154
Why are you here?

11
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:52,516
Your mother told Marwan
you took care of the American girl?

12
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,512
- Yeah.
- Then you need help getting rid of the body.

13
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,795
He's going to kill our son.

14
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,154
Yes.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,672
I took care of the girl. Marwan knows.

16
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,433
It's not Marwan who wants you dead.

17
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,999
Who wants me dead?

18
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,869
Your father.

19
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,119
Thank you for helping me out.
They said Maya's arrived.

20
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,998
She's in the exam area.
We're about to do a workup.

21
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,548
She suffers from schizophrenia.

22
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,478
I want us to be together again.

23
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,028
I'm sorry, Paul.

24
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,475
I'm seeing someone.

25
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,913
Paul, this is Jack Bauer.

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,309
Nice to meet you.

27
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,995
What was your courier transporting?

28
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,957
<i>It's a Dobson-type override. </i>

29
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,190
What exactly does this override do?

30
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,990
<i>It can remotely take control</i>
<i>of a nuclear power facility. </i>

31
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:47,277
A person with this program,
could they do the opposite?

32
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,590
Create a disaster at a plant, a meltdown?

33
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,590
<i>Theoretically. </i>

34
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:54,309
How many nuclear plants
in this country would be vulnerable?

35
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,913
<i>All of them. </i>

36
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,712
- <i> Yes?</i>
- It's me.

37
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,792
They found out about the override.

38
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,190
- Did you get the surveillance footage?
- No.

39
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,070
The Heritage dinner was monitored
by a private company, Felsted Security.

40
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,596
They've got the tapes, but
they're working off a closed system.

41
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,989
I've got to go pick up the tapes for you to ID.

42
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,119
- Where are you on the guestlist?
- I'm having it sent here.

43
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:41,035
- You know, we're running out of time.
- What do you mean? Is it that urgent?

44
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,875
Yes. It turns out your kidnapping was
just a cover for a much larger attack.

45
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:50,988
The trial was used to overload the Internet
to divert us from what they were really doing.

46
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:54,629
- I need a full tactical for my vehicle.
- Which is what?

47
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,632
They're in possession
of a device called an override.

48
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:01,110
With that they have control
of 104 nuclear plants in this country.

49
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,760
The device maintains heat levels
of the reactors.

50
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,389
Effectively, they can melt down
every one of those plants.

51
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,232
Thank you.

52
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,676
The man you saw when you
were held captive, he's our only lead.

53
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,911
Let me come to Felsted Security for the ID.
It'll be quicker.

54
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,073
I can't. After what you've been through today,
I'm not gonna put you at risk.

55
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:24,312
Our nation's nuclear plants will melt down
if we don't find that override.

56
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,472
We can't afford to waste any more time.

57
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,152
Come with me.

58
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,119
There are 104 nuclear power stations
in the US.

59
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:40,557
We've learnt that terrorists are trying
to convert all 104 cores into weapons.

60
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,154
Give us the worst-case casualty scenarios.

61
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:47,358
This graphic represents a single
meltdown scenario. Edgar, break it down.

62
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:52,878
The override will stop the coolant system
and the core will melt through containment.

63
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:57,795
The population within a ten-mile radius
will receive the highest doses of radiation.

64
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,758
Those people will die within two days.

65
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:05,356
Now, the smallest of these 104 cities
represents 75,000 people.

66
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:10,753
Multiply that by 104. We're looking at
7.8 million casualties, and that's conservative.

67
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,559
The environmental impact
will be catastrophic.

68
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:18,236
30 miles in all directions of each plant
will be uninhabitable for at least five years.

69
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,312
Don't plants have security systems
to prevent breaches?

70
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,198
They do, but the override's
already de-activated them.

71
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:28,717
And if we don't succeed, how long
before these cores start to melt down?

72
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,476
We're projecting the first radiation shock
waves in approximately three hours.

73
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:38,190
I want comm and logistics to work
on getting a handle on the software.

74
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:43,957
The rest of you will handle support
along with NRC personnel. Let's get to work.

75
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,679
- Erin, we're leaving now.
- Where are you going?

76
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,035
Audrey's given us a lead
we need to follow up.

77
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,430
- What kind of lead?
- I recognised someone, an American.

78
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,750
I saw him at a function
a couple of months ago.

79
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,355
We're going to view surveillance tapes
at a private security firm.

80
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:02,115
I don't want her going out now.
Why can't you access the tapes here?

81
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,236
I wish we could, but they're offline.

82
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,313
They'd have to record four hours of material
for us to view. We don't have time.

83
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,554
These people want to use nuclear plants
as weapons. We have to follow this lead now.

84
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:17,315
Sir, Audrey's the only person
who can make this ID.

85
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,234
If anything happens, Jack,
I will hold you personally responsible.

86
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,709
I understand.

87
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,597
- How far away is this facility?
- Not far, Burbank.

88
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,910
- Audrey.
- Paul.

89
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,116
- I'll get the team set up.
- We need to talk.

90
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,350
- We'll do it when I get back.
- From where?

91
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,955
We're following up on something.
Please, can we do this later?

92
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,632
- How many on your team?
- Four.

93
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:46,396
Set up a weapons package.
I'll meet you in the motor pool.

94
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,668
I don't know about this, but I know
about you and him, and I am not OK with it.

95
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:59,150
- You and I aren't together.
- We were trying to work things out.

96
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,835
Yeah, I tried.
But you kept putting it off, so I gave up.

97
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:06,151
We haven't been together for months.
We're not working it out.

98
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,310
- Sorry to interrupt.
- She is my wife.

99
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,789
Paul, please.

100
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,912
Excuse me.

101
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,070
She's my wife.

102
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,514
Don't you forget that.

103
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,315
Yeah.

104
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,469
Let's go.

105
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,790
- Jack, I'm sorry.
- It's fine.

106
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:44,349
I just received these files from DOD.
I need to give them to Bauer.

107
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:48,228
- Oh, you can't. Jack just left.
- Oh. Can I forward them to him?

108
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:52,108
He went with Audrey to Felsted Security
to look at some archive footage.

109
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,714
OK. I guess I could just
hold onto them for him.

110
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,268
Yeah, that'd be fine.

111
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:26,112
- Paul.
- Jim. We need to talk.

112
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,710
Come in here.

113
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,991
Do you know about Audrey and Jack Bauer?

114
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,674
Not till an hour ago.

115
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:45,320
They were carrying on right under your nose.

116
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:49,598
That's pretty unprofessional,
wouldn't you say?

117
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,280
Look, I understand your feelings about this,

118
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,717
but you and Audrey have been separated
for almost a year. Paul, I'm sorry.

119
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:02,032
She's a big girl, she can do what she wants.

120
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:06,398
Well, what she's doing is...
she's breaking my heart.

121
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,310
- Marianne.
- Sarah.

122
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:34,110
- What do you need back here?
- Edgar asked for a manual reboot of hub five.

123
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,510
- I can do that for him.
- No, no. It's fine.

124
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,556
OK.

125
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,753
- <i> Yes?</i>
- Bauer and Audrey left five minutes ago.

126
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:58,391
- Where'd they go?
- Felsted Security. 357 White Oak Boulevard.

127
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,473
All right. Good. You're going to need
to set things up on your end.

128
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,994
What? I should be done here.

129
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:08,152
No. When Jack Bauer
and Audrey Raines are killed,

130
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:13,109
CTU is going to know
that someone inside leaked their location.

131
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,918
- All right. What do I do?
- Divert suspicion.

132
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,108
Fine.

133
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,914
<i>I'm standing live just outside the perimeter. </i>

134
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,958
<i>Unfortunately the Pentagon</i>
<i>is not commenting,</i>

135
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:39,036
<i>but we do know that at 12:10pm Secretary</i>
<i>Heller and his daughter, Audrey Raines,</i>

136
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,874
<i>were successfully rescued. </i>
<i>The number of fatalities is unknown,</i>

137
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:47,511
<i>but sources say there might have been</i>
<i>as many as 20 terrorists inside the building,</i>

138
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,909
<i>and there are no survivors among them. </i>

139
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,991
- Yes?
- <i> Any lost data?</i>

140
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,958
The critical instructions
uploaded before the assault.

141
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,031
- <i>Good. Then we're all set?</i>
- Yes.

142
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:04,516
- The override has control of the plants.
- What about Behrooz? What about our son?

143
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:11,155
We have to be strong now.
We'll mourn him when this is over.

144
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,714
- Hello?
- <i> Mom?</i>

145
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,792
Behrooz? Are you all right?

146
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,110
Tariq tried to kill me.
He was gonna shoot me.

147
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,794
- I had to defend myself.
- What did you do?

148
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,759
- I killed him. You can't let Father know.
- Why not?

149
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:49,516
He's the one who told Tariq to do it. He wants
me dead because I messed up with Debbie.

150
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,991
Behrooz, that's not possible.
Your father would never want to hurt you.

151
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:57,550
It's true. Mom, I don't know what to do.

152
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,995
- You have to help me.
- Where are you now?

153
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:03,231
I'm near the Metrolink station
on Lassen in Chatsworth.

154
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,515
- Are you using Tariq's car?
- <i>Yes. </i>

155
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,831
Hide it. I'll pick you up there in a half hour.

156
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,911
Hurry.

157
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:20,117
- Who was on the phone?
- It was nothing important.

158
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,316
Liar.

159
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:27,313
- What did Behrooz do?
- What did you do? Did you give the order?

160
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:32,315
Behrooz was not committed. It was just
a matter of time before he turned against us.

161
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,233
You ordered Tariq to kill him.

162
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,470
To kill our own son.

163
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,790
No, no, no!

164
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,598
You...

165
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,709
- Where's Tariq?
- Behrooz killed him.

166
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,634
- That's impossible.
- Because you think he's weak? He's not.

167
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:55,794
Nothing, nothing will stand in the way
of what needs to be done.

168
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:59,190
Not him, not you.

169
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:03,910
- Where is he now?
- Why? What are you going to do?

170
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,596
- You're hurting me.
- I will do more than that.

171
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,750
Now, you listen to me, woman.

172
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:17,392
You will do exactly as you told him.
You will pick him up in half an hour.

173
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,278
What did you say to Paul?

174
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,834
That I'm filing for divorce
as soon as I get back to DC.

175
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,158
Are you sure that's what you want?

176
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,671
Yes.

177
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,791
OK.

178
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,755
Do you have something?

179
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:42,233
It seems the override hasn't completely taken
control. I'm starting to get some response.

180
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,550
- What can I do?
- Stay off hub five, I need it.

181
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:47,473
- I thought hub five was out for a reboot?
- No.

182
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,670
Curtis, come here.

183
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,631
- Could I talk to you for a minute?
- Actually, I'm kind of busy.

184
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,917
You lied to me
about doing a reboot for Edgar.

185
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,956
- Yes, I did.
- Why?

186
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,833
I made a personal call and I knew
it was inappropriate during the crisis.

187
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,878
- I didn't want anybody to know.
- Why'd you do it in here?

188
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,190
Why didn't you just go outside?

189
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:18,159
I was trying to make it look
like I was working. OK?

190
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,516
Look, I'm sorry. It won't happen again.

191
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,476
It's Marwan.

192
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:45,558
- Yes?
- Has Tariq taken care of your son?

193
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:49,428
I haven't spoken with Tariq, but
if there was a problem he would've called.

194
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:52,592
The fact I'm even talking to you
about this is a problem.

195
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:55,433
The next two hours are crucial.
I can't be distracted.

196
00:14:55,520 --> 00:15:00,878
I understand. I will personally oversee
the situation to make sure it's resolved.

197
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,679
- Fix this, Navi.
- Of course.

198
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,073
What is Marwan going to say
if he finds out Behrooz killed Tariq?

199
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,630
Tariq is expendable, like we all are.

200
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,870
Marwan understands that.

201
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:24,594
All he cares about is that Behrooz is silenced.

202
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:32,508
I will not be able to look at you after today
without thinking about what we did to him.

203
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,112
- I think I got it.
- What?

204
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,749
- The override. I got a piece of the code.
- What does that mean?

205
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,831
I can turn off the override,

206
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,229
- stop some of the meltdown.
- What do you need?

207
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,676
To get into the kernel, but the NRC
won't let me. It's too dangerous.

208
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:05,150
- Why?
- If I screw up, I could start a chain reaction.

209
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:09,358
All right. I need you to present this to Heller.
He can order NRC to let you in.

210
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,159
- Heller?
- He's in the situation room. Why?

211
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,832
- I shouldn't.
- Why not?

212
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,595
- I could faint. I have low blood sugar.
- It's just Driscoll and Heller.

213
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,275
- Driscoll's in there too?
- You'll be fine.

214
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,309
Excuse me. I'm gonna have to interrupt.

215
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,709
- What is it?
- This is Edgar Stiles.

216
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,792
He's requesting access
to the kernels of the power plants.

217
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:35,555
My understanding is that no one
is to manipulate those kernels

218
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,915
while the plants are online.

219
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,116
There is a way to do it if you're careful.

220
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:44,751
I'd stay away from the precompiled headers
while putting a lock on the override code.

221
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,990
The chances of a load imbalance...

222
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:52,074
I don't understand what you're talking about.
Just tell me what the downside is

223
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,994
if the kernels are disrupted
because of your manipulation.

224
00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:02,189
If I make a mistake, I can accelerate
a core meltdown in some of the reactors.

225
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,714
This is a bad idea.
Maybe we shouldn't do it.

226
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:08,873
- If you're successful, you can regain control?
- Yes.

227
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:14,557
Edgar, what we need to know
is can you do this without making a mistake?

228
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,837
- Yeah, I can do it.
- You're not filling me with confidence, Edgar.

229
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,797
Look,

230
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:29,431
I'm just a little nervous,
but if I say I can do it, I can do it.

231
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,435
- He'll run away the moment he sees you.
- He won't see me.

232
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,671
You'll be the only one in the car
when you pick him up.

233
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,716
- It's Behrooz.
- Answer it.

234
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,031
- Hello?
- Are you almost here?

235
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,680
<i>Yes. </i>

236
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:00,311
- What did you tell Dad?
- I didn't, I just left. He was busy working.

237
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:04,196
What are we going to do?
Wherever we go, he'll find us.

238
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:07,078
No, he won't. I know a safe place.

239
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:15,396
I didn't understand until today
what it would feel like doing these things.

240
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:19,519
They're wrong, Mom. And I see it now.

241
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:24,196
Don't think about that any more.
You'll be safe now.

242
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:27,078
But I am thinking about it.

243
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,958
I should go to the police
and tell them everything.

244
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,076
We'll talk about it when I get there.

245
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,231
OK.

246
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,795
You did well.

247
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:22,438
- Who are they?
- Don't worry about it.

248
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,750
Take the second exit at Angeles Crest.

249
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:28,150
- He's going to ask me why I'm stopping.
- Let him ask.

250
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,959
- What do I tell him?
- Don't tell him anything.

251
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,596
We'll meet you there.

252
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,596
- Erin. We're making good progress.
- Tell me.

253
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:09,673
- We've taken 87 plants offline. They're safe.
- What about the other 17?

254
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,830
The terrorists blocked a shutdown.

255
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:15,230
- Everything we're trying is repelled.
- How do we get around it?

256
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:19,871
Believe me, Erin, we're trying everything.
If there's a way, we'll find it.

257
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:22,076
I'll keep you posted.

258
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,279
- Sweetheart?
- Mom.

259
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:36,876
- How are you feeling?
- Not good. I want Dr Arnowitz.

260
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,236
- You can't see him today.
- Why not?

261
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,959
Because I can't leave, but I want you close by.

262
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,873
Then stay here with me.

263
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,752
I'll be back in a few minutes, I promise.

264
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:54,753
But you have to do something for me, OK?
I need you to do something.

265
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,831
Maya, look at me.

266
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:01,397
You need to cooperate with the doctors.

267
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,993
- OK?
- OK.

268
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,754
OK.

269
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,831
Come on.

270
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,550
I'll be back.

271
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,870
I promise.

272
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,878
Take these, please.

273
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:37,273
Your son underwent SDT
for two and a half hours.

274
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,828
- What'd he say when you took him off it?
- Nothing.

275
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:44,436
You tortured my son for almost three hours
and ended up yielding nothing?

276
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,715
You gave the order, sir.

277
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:00,072
- <i>Give us a moment, please. </i>
- <i>Yes, sir. </i>

278
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:10,158
I'm sorry this had to happen, but we had to
make sure you weren't withholding anything.

279
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,231
I hate you.

280
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:16,357
I never want to see you again.

281
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:24,432
Please understand that I am responsible
for the lives of millions of people.

282
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,228
You torture me
and now you want me to forgive you?

283
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:35,394
It just confirms everything
I always knew about you.

284
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,195
Am I free to leave?

285
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,316
Yes.

286
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,477
- Yeah, Paul?
- <i>Audrey, do you have a minute?</i>

287
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,073
Sure.

288
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:14,597
Your dad said something that I've been
thinking about. He said you were a big girl.

289
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:18,719
- I think I've been treating you like a child.
- I don't think that, Paul.

290
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:22,156
<i>Whether it comes off that way or not,</i>
<i>I need to respect your choices,</i>

291
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,550
<i>respect who you are, and... </i>

292
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,271
<i>I've been so stupid about all of this. </i>

293
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,795
I've lost sight of the things I love about you.

294
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,358
Look...

295
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:40,195
I hear what you're saying, but I...
I don't really know how to respond to that.

296
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,840
You don't have to.
I just want you to know that...

297
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:45,992
<i>I've been wrong about a lot of things. </i>

298
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,595
<i>Before you make any big decisions,</i>
<i>that you're entitled to make,</i>

299
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,152
let some time go by.

300
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,949
<i>Is that fair?</i>
<i>Is that fair of me to ask?</i>

301
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:58,235
Yeah, yeah, that's fair.

302
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:02,875
<i>OK, well, I'll... I'll see you later. </i>

303
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,996
Yeah, see you later.

304
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,392
- How far out are we?
A few miles away, sir.

305
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,471
OK.

306
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,480
- Where are we gonna go?
- Out of the city.

307
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,994
Why did Father want to kill me? I'm his son!

308
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:51,870
Stop, Behrooz, you can't
think about that now. Get in, get in.

309
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,873
We killed two people today.

310
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,919
- I can't do this. I'm freaking out.
- Sh.

311
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,953
Get on the train.

312
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:12,237
- What?
- Your father's following us.

313
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,834
- What?
- It was the only way I could save you.

314
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:17,070
Now! Dammit, Behrooz, get out! Go!

315
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,992
Go!

316
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,355
- Obey me!
- Mom!

317
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,717
Go!

318
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:51,953
<i>... the secretary's rescue. </i>
<i>Mark Scortino is standing by. </i>

319
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:54,508
<i>Mark, what's going on down there?</i>

320
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:58,798
- Is it taken care of?
- No. There's a problem.

321
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,952
My wife and Behrooz have betrayed us.

322
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,269
- Where are they now?
- I don't know.

323
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:21,238
But Dina's wounded.
She'll need medical attention.

324
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:25,199
So you come to me,
asking me for help with this mess?

325
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:29,590
I can't do it alone, Marwan.

326
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,750
I'm ashamed of myself.

327
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,559
Allow me to make this right.

328
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,916
- What would you need?
- To monitor the local hospitals.

329
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:44,110
I'll also need drivers,
as well as access to police frequencies.

330
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:47,476
- You think she'll go to the police?
- No. No.

331
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:52,156
But they may pick her up
if they find out she's been shot.

332
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:03,719
I told you.
I can't be distracted by this right now.

333
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:12,635
Give him what he needs. Make sure Dina and
the child are captured before they do us harm.

334
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,790
Thank you. Thank you.

335
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:22,792
No matter what happens today,
you will answer for this.

336
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,433
I understand.

337
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,434
- <i> Has she seen the tapes?</i>
- No.

338
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:45,593
- <i>I'll put the guestlist together. </i>
- How long will it take to create the database?

339
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:48,399
<i>Not long. </i>
<i>Once you identify him, we'll run it through. </i>

340
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,674
OK.

341
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:53,992
- <i>I'll let you know the second it's done. </i>
- OK, Marcy. Thanks.

342
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:57,072
We have a copy of the guestlist
from the dinner.

343
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:00,709
Once you make an ID, we'll send it
through a database, find out who it is.

344
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,552
- OK.
- I'm carrying.

345
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,108
Yeah?

346
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,953
- This is Marianne Taylor at CTU.
- <i>What is it?</i>

347
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:11,953
Curtis says that as soon as
Audrey recognises someone from the video,

348
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,600
he wants it sent to my system.
I'm on 60 Casper.

349
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,671
Why didn't he tell me himself?

350
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:20,389
They're trying to shut down
the remaining plants. Everybody's on that.

351
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,278
Are they gonna be able
to control them in time?

352
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,716
- I don't know.
- OK, keep me informed.

353
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:30,349
- What is it?
- We don't have a lot of time.

354
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:35,994
- She's doing better now she's sleeping.
- That's very good news.

355
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,791
- Did you give her Haldol?
- Why?

356
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,235
She's allergic to it. It's in her file.

357
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,550
- The date is old, it's the wrong file.
- Maya!

358
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,551
Maya!

359
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,517
She's unconscious.

360
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,672
Mary, we have a code.
I need 25ccs of norepinephrine.

361
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:59,433
How could you
have got the wrong file?

362
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,190
Excuse me, please step back.

363
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:04,919
I need that syringe now.

364
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,955
- Doctor, 25ccs.
- Ms Driscoll, Secretary Heller...

365
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:14,112
- Let's go, Mary.
- Mary, make sure I get a crash cart...

366
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,395
What is it, Sarah?

367
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,198
Sarah?

368
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:21,192
- Secretary Heller needs you.
- For what?

369
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:26,877
He's going online with the president and
wants to know our progress on the reactors.

370
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:33,672
Tell him Edgar's still trying to get control of
the kernel and we'll know more in 15 minutes.

371
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:38,231
If we do stop the meltdown, he wants to know
if there'll be any system contamination.

372
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:42,791
No, there won't be any contamination.
It'll take 36 hours to reboot the reactors.

373
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,792
Is there anything else?
- No, that's all.

374
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,871
All right, go.

375
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:58,232
We had security cameras
running on only two areas.

376
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:01,153
One covering the main ballroom,
one at the entrance.

377
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,390
OK. Put them both on.

378
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:13,834
Ballroom angle's too wide.
Let's just go with the entrance.

379
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,036
What time is that?
- 6:39.

380
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:20,477
That's too early.
I met him when I arrived, around 9, 9:15.

381
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:23,154
All right.

382
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:36,918
Wait, stop.

383
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:41,310
- Can you back this up a few frames?
- Sure.

384
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:48,597
Wait, wait. Stop. There.

385
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,190
I think that's him.

386
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,869
- Can you enhance him right here?
- Yeah.

387
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:58,349
That image won't process. We need it clearer.

388
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:01,238
Let me see if I can get that for you.

389
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,994
Who's supposed to be at that desk?

390
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:14,153
Oh, that's Mitchell.
Probably went out for another smoke.

391
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,915
That gate's open. No one's there.
Do you copy?

392
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,560
Craig?

393
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:24,230
Rick?

394
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,311
- How many ways into this area?
- Two.

395
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:29,472
Put 'em up. Rick!

396
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,955
Get down!

397
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:39,070
- You OK?
- Yeah.

398
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,674
Dammit.

399
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:49,038
I'm gonna call for help, but I need to know
where the tape is. Where's the source?

400
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:52,829
The... main... server.

401
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,831
How do I access it?

402
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:58,913
- On the... flash memory.
- OK.

403
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,878
Watch the security monitors.

404
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,839
Do you have Sticks?

405
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:13,238
- Gary, do you have Sticks?
- In my... p-pocket.

406
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,510
OK.

407
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,875
Stay with me.

408
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:33,192
- He's gone.
- Jack, they're coming!

409
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,994
- They're sealing us off.
- Should we call CTU?

410
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:40,914
No. CTU's been compromised. That's
the only way they'd know we were here.

411
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,991
We gotta get out of here.

412
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,994
Move. Go, go!

413
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,551
Go.

414
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,910
Come on.

415
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,235
Go, go.

416
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,908
- There's one in the pipe. Safety's off.
- Jack.

417
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,117
You can do this. We'll cover each other.

418
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:40,629
- I thought CTU had been compromised?
- It has been.

419
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:44,393
Then who are you calling?

420
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:49,037
The only person I can trust right now.

421
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,750
And if there are 17 nuclear power plants
about to melt down,

422
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:12,071
I need to update an evacuation strategy.

423
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:15,596
I agree. I've laid the groundwork
with the National Guard.

424
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:22,153
<i>They will go into individual communities</i>
<i>and effect evacuation upon your command. </i>

425
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,471
A worst-case scenario
gives us approximately three hours?

426
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,915
That's correct, sir.

427
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,356
<i>Erin, what are our chances</i>
<i>of shutting down the remaining 17?</i>

428
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,716
At this time, I would say
it's less than 50 per cent.

429
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,678
But we're trying something
to improve those chances.

430
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,876
- <i>When will you know more?</i>
- 15 minutes.

431
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:42,394
- <i>Keep me updated. </i>
- Yes, Mr President.

432
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,677
Let's find out if Jack and Audrey
have come up with anything.

433
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,751
Yes, sir.

434
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:57,749
Mr Secretary. I can have a room
prepared for you to rest, if you'd like.

435
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:00,479
You've been under a great deal of strain.

436
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:03,757
No, I don't think I can rest.
But thanks anyway.

437
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,994
- Erin.
- Yes, sir?

438
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:13,037
I understand your daughter's
down in the clinic.

439
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:16,908
- Yes, but it won't interfere with my work.
- I'm sure it won't.

440
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,992
I was just wondering if everything was OK.

441
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:25,113
It's something we've lived with
since she was six.

442
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,953
There are good days and bad days.

443
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:30,031
Today's a bad one.

444
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:32,634
I'm sorry.

445
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,399
We gotta go right.

446
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,475
OK, come on.

447
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:59,639
We're clear.

448
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,556
Move. Move!

449
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:21,756
I don't think there's anybody here.

450
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,440
We'll get through this,
but you gotta listen to me.

451
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,318
I need to get that guy's weapon,
I need you to cover me.

452
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:46,154
Save your ammunition.
Space out your shots. You ready? OK.

453
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,391
Dammit!

454
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,872
- Audrey, get down!
- I'm out!

455
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,076
Stay down!

456
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,351
- I'm empty. I'm empty!
- What?

457
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,869
- Jack!
- Tony!

458
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:34,555
- You OK?
- Yeah, we're all right! Move. Move!

459
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:55,120
- Edgar's on the final sequence.
- Is he in the kernel?

460
00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:01,309
Yes. He can't make a mistake or it'll accelerate
the meltdowns instead of stopping them.

461
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:08,595
Sarah, look up the op-code
for the load A register conditional.

462
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:11,717
- FFO9.
- No, that's a jump A. I need a load A.

463
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,950
Dammit. Move.

464
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:20,633
- That's it. ABA1. I think I got it.
- What do you mean you "think"?

465
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:23,871
- I'd like to go through it again.
- How long will that take?

466
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:26,076
- Ten minutes?
- We don't have time.

467
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:29,675
- Let me just check the headers.
- Now, Edgar.

468
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,354
I did the best I could, sir. I hope it works.

469
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:48,431
So do I.

470
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:08,594
There's no response.

471
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,909
Come on.

472
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,595
There they go.

473
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:40,790
- Congratulations, Edgar.
- Thank you, sir.

474
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:57,230
- No, don't tell me that.
Edgar, what's going on?

475
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:02,149
Why are some of the reactors
still not shutting down?

476
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,988
Edgar, talk to me.

477
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:13,118
Six of the reactors
are immune to the kill sequence.

478
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:17,239
- The override's taken over their system.
- Those six are going to melt down?

479
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:20,153
The shutdown codes
have been completely corrupted.

480
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:25,394
Contact Bauer. Either he finds the people
responsible for planting the override,

481
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:29,112
or we're looking at a nuclear holocaust.

482
