Episode 16

6
00:00:10,505 --> 00:00:12,805
Previously on 24 ...

7
00:00:16,338 --> 00:00:17,640
No!

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,652
Sir, it's Senator Mayer.

9
00:00:19,772 --> 00:00:22,015
He's dead.
Are you telling me

10
00:00:22,084 --> 00:00:23,984
that Jack Bauer just killed

11
00:00:24,052 --> 00:00:25,986
a United States Senator?

12
00:00:26,054 --> 00:00:27,421
How could you have let
this happen?!

13
00:00:27,489 --> 00:00:29,690
Mr. Kanin, you are not going
to lay this one at my feet.

14
00:00:29,757 --> 00:00:32,193
What is it, Ethan, what's wrong?

15
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:33,827
Madam President,
I'm afraid I have no choice

16
00:00:33,895 --> 00:00:36,029
but to resign
as your chief of staff.

17
00:00:36,098 --> 00:00:38,265
You're taking this too far.

18
00:00:38,333 --> 00:00:40,267
Where's Jack?
We don't have him.

19
00:00:40,335 --> 00:00:41,335
The man

20
00:00:41,403 --> 00:00:42,769
who framed Jack
for Burnett's murder was

21
00:00:42,837 --> 00:00:45,068
John Quinn,
a Starkwood contractor.

22
00:00:45,188 --> 00:00:47,040
Jack went to Mayer
to get the evidence

23
00:00:47,109 --> 00:00:48,542
to prove it.

24
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:49,776
Starkwood was involved
with everything

25
00:00:49,844 --> 00:00:51,212
that's happened today.
They were the ones

26
00:00:51,279 --> 00:00:53,114
that helped Juma and his men
bring down the planes and attack

27
00:00:53,181 --> 00:00:54,248
the White House.

28
00:00:54,316 --> 00:00:55,616
In exchange,
they were allowed to develop

29
00:00:55,683 --> 00:00:58,319
and manufacture a WMD
in Sangala.

30
00:00:58,386 --> 00:01:00,387
The text message I got
off their agent's cell phone

31
00:01:00,455 --> 00:01:02,156
said "Port of Alexandria,

32
00:01:02,224 --> 00:01:04,325
lot "C," 10:15 p.m."

33
00:01:04,392 --> 00:01:06,727
Code red, code red!
Engage, engage.

34
00:01:15,036 --> 00:01:16,670
Get that truck out of here now!

35
00:01:16,738 --> 00:01:18,172
Tony!
The truck--

36
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,173
I'm going after it!

37
00:01:19,241 --> 00:01:20,274
Cover me now!

38
00:01:31,153 --> 00:01:32,353
I'm in possession
of a biological weapon

39
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:33,854
interdicted
at the Port of Alexandria.

40
00:01:50,138 --> 00:01:52,005
What's your status?

41
00:01:52,073 --> 00:01:53,340
Package is secure;
we're inbound.

42
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:54,343
What about Bauer?

43
00:01:54,463 --> 00:01:55,543
He's at the scene, sir,

44
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:56,877
but he sought cover nearby.

45
00:01:56,944 --> 00:01:59,346
We have to assume that
he contacted the authorities,

46
00:01:59,414 --> 00:02:01,649
so we'd better be
on an accelerated timetable.

47
00:02:01,716 --> 00:02:03,184
Get over here.

48
00:02:03,251 --> 00:02:04,885
Starkwood reacquired
the bioweapon.

49
00:02:04,952 --> 00:02:06,620
They airlifted the freight
right out of here.

50
00:02:06,688 --> 00:02:08,556
They were headed due west
from my current position.

51
00:02:08,623 --> 00:02:09,990
Jack, I can't assault
a private compound

52
00:02:10,058 --> 00:02:11,727
unless I have proof
that a weapon exists.

53
00:02:11,847 --> 00:02:13,294
Okay, where is the CDC?

54
00:02:13,361 --> 00:02:14,695
They're scrambling a team
right now.

55
00:02:14,762 --> 00:02:15,762
Send them to me.

56
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:17,494
You'll have
all the proof you need.

57
00:02:17,614 --> 00:02:18,499
Jack, what happened?

58
00:02:18,567 --> 00:02:20,668
I was exposed.

59
00:02:21,069 --> 00:02:25,969
The following takes place
between 11:00 P.M. and 12:00 A.M.

60
00:02:39,987 --> 00:02:42,089
We're ready for you, sir,
come with me.

61
00:02:54,068 --> 00:02:55,168
Mr. Bauer.

62
00:02:55,237 --> 00:02:57,003
Dr. Macer, CDC.

63
00:02:57,071 --> 00:02:58,772
We need you to
get undressed.

64
00:03:01,909 --> 00:03:04,278
You're the one
that talked to Agent Moss?

65
00:03:04,346 --> 00:03:05,579
He brought me up to speed,

66
00:03:05,647 --> 00:03:07,381
said you had some information
about the bioweapon.

67
00:03:07,449 --> 00:03:09,916
All I know is that it was
developed in Sangala,

68
00:03:09,984 --> 00:03:11,852
and according to rumors
from the village

69
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:13,086
that it was tested on,

70
00:03:13,154 --> 00:03:15,165
all the victims suffered
from dementia and paralysis.

71
00:03:15,285 --> 00:03:17,413
Check neurological
vectors and pathogens.

72
00:03:17,533 --> 00:03:19,192
How much was released?

73
00:03:19,261 --> 00:03:21,729
I'm not exactly sure.

74
00:03:21,796 --> 00:03:23,718
The weapon was stored
in a pressurized canister.

75
00:03:23,838 --> 00:03:25,566
It was breached
for maybe two minutes

76
00:03:25,634 --> 00:03:26,833
before I could seal it off.

77
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:34,875
This is not
a reaction.

78
00:03:34,942 --> 00:03:36,143
I've had
these scars.

79
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:39,194
This is a full
spectrum antibiotic.

80
00:03:39,314 --> 00:03:40,113
It should counteract

81
00:03:40,181 --> 00:03:42,190
a wide range of
known pathogens.

82
00:03:44,786 --> 00:03:46,887
Step inside, sir.

83
00:03:55,129 --> 00:03:58,198
Raise your arms and
close your eyes.

84
00:04:08,725 --> 00:04:09,359
Janis, where are we?

85
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:12,212
Metro closed down a six-mile
stretch of Highway 236.

86
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,147
The CDC first responders
are on-site. What the hell's

87
00:04:14,215 --> 00:04:15,596
going on?
One of the bioweapon canisters

88
00:04:15,716 --> 00:04:17,918
was breached.

89
00:04:17,985 --> 00:04:19,085
Jack may have been exposed.

90
00:04:19,153 --> 00:04:22,022
Oh, my God.
Starkwood took the canisters.

91
00:04:22,089 --> 00:04:23,722
They're probably flying it
back to their main compound

92
00:04:23,842 --> 00:04:25,759
in Virginia, along
with Tony Almeida.

93
00:04:25,827 --> 00:04:27,453
- Almeida?
- Yeah, he was working with Jack.

94
00:04:27,573 --> 00:04:28,862
We think he might have been
taken captive.

95
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:30,597
Hang on one second. I
need you to put together

96
00:04:30,665 --> 00:04:31,732
a briefing packet
on Starkwood.

97
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,367
I want every division
caught up to speed

98
00:04:33,435 --> 00:04:34,702
on what we might
be dealing with.

99
00:04:34,769 --> 00:04:35,869
You planning to
move on Starkwood?

100
00:04:35,937 --> 00:04:37,404
That place is enormous;
it's practically

101
00:04:37,472 --> 00:04:39,373
a military base.
We're not going to do anything

102
00:04:39,441 --> 00:04:41,208
till we have concrete evidence
on the bioweapon from CDC.

103
00:04:41,275 --> 00:04:42,676
Then I'll inform
the president.

104
00:04:42,744 --> 00:04:44,712
She'll decide
how to proceed.

105
00:05:25,086 --> 00:05:28,389
Almeida's not going
to talk.

106
00:05:28,456 --> 00:05:30,424
He's not the type;
he's the brave type.

107
00:05:30,492 --> 00:05:33,226
Know the psychology
of your subject.

108
00:05:33,294 --> 00:05:36,196
That's in our manual.

109
00:05:36,264 --> 00:05:37,865
Here we go.

110
00:05:43,471 --> 00:05:45,406
Mr. Hodges,

111
00:05:45,473 --> 00:05:47,941
we isolated
the damaged canister.

112
00:05:48,009 --> 00:05:49,476
We got lucky.

113
00:05:49,544 --> 00:05:51,077
They know we
have the weapons.

114
00:05:51,145 --> 00:05:52,245
That's not so lucky.

115
00:05:52,313 --> 00:05:53,480
How fast can you
have them ready?

116
00:05:53,548 --> 00:05:55,482
It's going to take me
at least two hours.

117
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:57,284
Too long, Tom.
Sir, we don't know

118
00:05:57,351 --> 00:05:58,351
what the government knows.

119
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,720
They're coming,
and they'll be coming

120
00:05:59,788 --> 00:06:02,088
with everything they've got,
and the only thing

121
00:06:02,156 --> 00:06:04,758
that's going to stop them
is getting these weapons ready

122
00:06:04,826 --> 00:06:05,826
to deploy.

123
00:06:05,894 --> 00:06:08,295
Yes, sir, I'll do my best.

124
00:06:08,362 --> 00:06:10,864
I know you will.

125
00:06:16,771 --> 00:06:17,805
Okay, let's go!

126
00:06:33,354 --> 00:06:35,889
What does
the FBI know?

127
00:06:35,957 --> 00:06:37,491
I'm not going to
ask you again.

128
00:06:39,193 --> 00:06:40,427
(coughing)

129
00:06:44,432 --> 00:06:46,266
Okay.

130
00:06:50,204 --> 00:06:51,705
You're a good man, Tony.

131
00:06:52,874 --> 00:06:54,842
I know your profile.

132
00:06:54,909 --> 00:06:56,710
You've had some
hard breaks.

133
00:06:56,778 --> 00:07:00,581
I don't want to see you hurt,

134
00:07:00,648 --> 00:07:02,483
so you just tell me
what the FBI knows

135
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:05,953
about what we're
doing here,

136
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:08,355
and I can't say you'll
walk away smiling--

137
00:07:08,422 --> 00:07:10,491
that would be
unrealistic--

138
00:07:10,558 --> 00:07:13,894
but you'll be alive.

139
00:07:15,663 --> 00:07:17,631
You hear me?

140
00:07:24,706 --> 00:07:30,143
But I don't know
anything, Mr. Hodges.

141
00:07:40,187 --> 00:07:44,791
I'm giving you
a way out, Tony.

142
00:07:44,859 --> 00:07:46,894
Sir,

143
00:07:46,961 --> 00:07:48,629
may I speak to you for a moment?

144
00:07:48,696 --> 00:07:51,364
Not now, Greg.

145
00:07:51,432 --> 00:07:52,699
Please, sir,

146
00:07:52,767 --> 00:07:54,167
just for a moment.

147
00:08:02,744 --> 00:08:04,678
What is it?

148
00:08:04,746 --> 00:08:07,836
This was supposed to
be a covert operation.

149
00:08:07,956 --> 00:08:08,742
That is not
the case

150
00:08:08,862 --> 00:08:09,750
anymore.

151
00:08:09,817 --> 00:08:11,718
The government knows
that we have these weapons,

152
00:08:11,786 --> 00:08:13,954
and they're not just going
to sit on that information.

153
00:08:15,056 --> 00:08:17,991
What are you suggesting, Greg?

154
00:08:18,059 --> 00:08:21,261
Maybe we should destroy
the evidence

155
00:08:21,328 --> 00:08:23,129
while we still have
some time.

156
00:08:24,165 --> 00:08:26,099
I can't believe

157
00:08:26,167 --> 00:08:28,802
that I'm hearing
this from you.

158
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:30,037
I'm just trying
to help, sir.

159
00:08:30,104 --> 00:08:32,338
I care about this company
as much as you do.

160
00:08:32,406 --> 00:08:34,908
Oh, I doubt that.

161
00:08:34,976 --> 00:08:37,510
We've invested a lot
of blood and treasure

162
00:08:37,579 --> 00:08:39,947
to get these weapons, and I'm
not going to give them up.

163
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:44,217
Think about what
you're risking, sir--

164
00:08:44,285 --> 00:08:47,287
everything,
everything you've built.

165
00:08:47,354 --> 00:08:49,022
You say you're
trying to help.

166
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:50,724
You know what I think?

167
00:08:50,792 --> 00:08:52,459
I think you're worried
about your own ass.

168
00:08:52,526 --> 00:08:55,729
Get him out of here and
do what you have to do.

169
00:08:55,797 --> 00:08:58,632
Think about what I said,
young man.

170
00:08:58,700 --> 00:08:59,766
You're a little nervous,
Greg.

171
00:08:59,834 --> 00:09:01,001
Well, I've got a news flash:

172
00:09:01,069 --> 00:09:02,669
we're all nervous.

173
00:09:02,737 --> 00:09:04,471
Keep your doubts to yourself.

174
00:09:04,538 --> 00:09:06,974
I'm not going to tell you again.

175
00:09:10,678 --> 00:09:12,445
We're going to need to take
more blood and saliva samples,

176
00:09:12,513 --> 00:09:14,881
and I'd like to collect
a spinal fluid specimen.

177
00:09:14,949 --> 00:09:16,016
Until we know
what we're dealing with,

178
00:09:16,084 --> 00:09:17,517
we need to keep you
under quarantine.

179
00:09:17,585 --> 00:09:18,852
How long is it gonna be
till you know

180
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:19,953
whether or not
I've been infected?

181
00:09:20,021 --> 00:09:21,488
We should have the
preliminary results

182
00:09:21,555 --> 00:09:22,823
in the next
15 minutes.

183
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:24,024
Okay.
Dr. Macer,

184
00:09:24,092 --> 00:09:25,859
we've detected

185
00:09:25,927 --> 00:09:27,494
trace amounts of an
airborne pathogen.

186
00:09:27,561 --> 00:09:29,162
It's concentrated
near the truck.

187
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:30,697
We're also picking it up in
the surrounding environments

188
00:09:30,765 --> 00:09:31,999
at much lower
concentrations.

189
00:09:32,066 --> 00:09:33,166
Can you identify it?

190
00:09:33,234 --> 00:09:34,701
No, but we're analyzing
a sample now.

191
00:09:34,769 --> 00:09:36,503
These levels shouldn't present
any danger

192
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:37,704
to the nearby population,

193
00:09:37,772 --> 00:09:39,472
but I still want
atmospheric monitors set up.

194
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:42,575
It's a good thing you sealed
off the canister, Mr. Bauer.

195
00:09:42,644 --> 00:09:44,911
You saved a
lot of lives.

196
00:09:44,979 --> 00:09:46,980
You're going to have
to transport me back to FBI.

197
00:09:47,048 --> 00:09:49,315
I'm still material evidence
in an ongoing terrorist threat.

198
00:09:49,383 --> 00:09:50,316
Those were
our orders.

199
00:09:50,384 --> 00:09:51,417
We can run our
tests from there.

200
00:09:51,485 --> 00:09:53,486
Okay.

201
00:09:57,792 --> 00:10:00,260
Bob Justman's been
associate counsel

202
00:10:00,327 --> 00:10:01,528
for the past three years.

203
00:10:01,595 --> 00:10:03,931
He and Ethan worked
very closely together.

204
00:10:04,051 --> 00:10:07,034
He is certainly qualified
to be chief of staff.

205
00:10:07,101 --> 00:10:08,735
But...

206
00:10:08,803 --> 00:10:11,204
After what's happened today,

207
00:10:11,272 --> 00:10:13,675
I think you should be looking
outside your administration.

208
00:10:13,795 --> 00:10:15,842
An insider has a leg up.

209
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:19,846
Chief of staff has a
steep learning curve.

210
00:10:19,914 --> 00:10:22,200
I think you're underestimating

211
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,950
the value
of a fresh perspective.

212
00:10:24,018 --> 00:10:26,553
You have
someone in mind.

213
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,689
I do.

214
00:10:28,756 --> 00:10:29,890
Rick Berman.

215
00:10:33,194 --> 00:10:35,975
Would Rick even consider leaving
the private sector?

216
00:10:36,095 --> 00:10:37,230
Well, he's made his fortune.

217
00:10:37,298 --> 00:10:39,232
I think he'd jump at the
chance to serve his country.

218
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,600
Let's sit down with him.

219
00:10:40,668 --> 00:10:42,202
Great.

220
00:10:42,269 --> 00:10:43,564
But keep Bob on the list.

221
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:46,173
I still have a good feeling
about him.

222
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,875
I'll start to set up
meetings tomorrow.

223
00:10:48,943 --> 00:10:53,646
Livy, it could take weeks
to find Ethan's replacement.

224
00:10:53,715 --> 00:10:56,482
In the meantime,

225
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:59,438
I'm going to need
a provisional chief of staff.

226
00:10:59,558 --> 00:11:01,254
I'd like that to be you.

227
00:11:03,825 --> 00:11:05,480
Um...

228
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,245
Madam President?

229
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:07,043
Yes?

230
00:11:07,163 --> 00:11:09,863
Tim Woods is here to see you.
Just give me a minute,

231
00:11:09,931 --> 00:11:11,064
please, and then
send him in.

232
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:15,202
Livy, I need someone
I can trust.

233
00:11:15,269 --> 00:11:18,205
Especially after everything
that's happened today.

234
00:11:18,272 --> 00:11:21,942
You're not going to say "no"
to your mother, are you?

235
00:11:24,511 --> 00:11:26,546
Of course not.

236
00:11:26,614 --> 00:11:28,548
Good.

237
00:11:29,751 --> 00:11:31,952
Madam President,
I have Larry Moss

238
00:11:32,019 --> 00:11:33,620
at FBI calling for you.

239
00:11:33,687 --> 00:11:34,755
What's this about?

240
00:11:34,822 --> 00:11:36,223
I don't know the specifics,

241
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:38,308
but he says it involves
an imminent homeland threat.

242
00:11:39,526 --> 00:11:40,761
Put him through.

243
00:11:42,363 --> 00:11:43,463
It's all right, Tim.

244
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:46,599
I've made Olivia
Acting Chief of Staff.

245
00:11:48,535 --> 00:11:50,436
Agent Moss,
you're on with the president.

246
00:11:50,504 --> 00:11:53,106
Madam President, we have
a situation developing.

247
00:11:53,174 --> 00:11:55,541
First of all, you need
to know that Jack Bauer

248
00:11:55,609 --> 00:11:58,278
did not kill Ryan Burnett
nor Senator Blaine Mayer.

249
00:11:58,345 --> 00:11:59,479
He was framed
for their murders.

250
00:11:59,546 --> 00:12:00,613
I knew it.

251
00:12:00,681 --> 00:12:02,715
Who framed him?
Our operational theory

252
00:12:02,784 --> 00:12:04,918
is that he was set up
by Starkwood.

253
00:12:04,986 --> 00:12:07,420
I don't understand.
Why would Starkwood frame Jack?

254
00:12:07,488 --> 00:12:10,090
To cover up the fact that
they helped Juma stage

255
00:12:10,158 --> 00:12:11,992
the terrorist attacks today.

256
00:12:12,059 --> 00:12:12,993
What?

257
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,294
Ma'am, we have evidence

258
00:12:14,361 --> 00:12:15,962
that Starkwood provided Juma

259
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:17,764
with technological
support and intelligence.

260
00:12:17,832 --> 00:12:20,100
And in return, Juma allowed
Starkwood to use Sangala

261
00:12:20,168 --> 00:12:22,335
as a base to operate
without having

262
00:12:22,403 --> 00:12:23,536
to worry about any oversight.

263
00:12:23,604 --> 00:12:25,238
A base for what?

264
00:12:25,306 --> 00:12:27,573
To manufacture
weapons of mass destruction.

265
00:12:27,641 --> 00:12:30,844
Specifically,
biological weapons.

266
00:12:41,422 --> 00:12:43,824
What kind of bioweapons
are you talking about?

267
00:12:43,891 --> 00:12:45,358
We're not sure,
but it could be

268
00:12:45,426 --> 00:12:47,427
some kind of neurological
pathogen.

269
00:12:47,494 --> 00:12:49,637
CDC has obtained a sample
and they're analyzing it now.

270
00:12:49,757 --> 00:12:51,788
Agent Moss, you said there
was an imminent threat.

271
00:12:51,908 --> 00:12:53,715
Yes, a large shipment
of bioweapons

272
00:12:53,835 --> 00:12:55,274
was delivered
to Starkwood.

273
00:12:55,394 --> 00:12:56,926
We believe they're
in possession of them now.

274
00:12:57,046 --> 00:12:58,839
Are you saying these weapons
are on U.S. soil?

275
00:12:58,906 --> 00:13:00,340
We suspect they're
at the Starkwood

276
00:13:00,407 --> 00:13:01,541
headquarters
in Virginia.

277
00:13:01,608 --> 00:13:03,176
You're not suggesting
that Starkwood

278
00:13:03,244 --> 00:13:06,012
intends to use those weapons
to attack this country?

279
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,882
We don't know,
but, given their actions today,

280
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:10,884
we need to move
on Starkwood immediately.

281
00:13:13,955 --> 00:13:18,124
Madam President?

282
00:13:18,192 --> 00:13:20,626
Assemble the Cabinet
and the Joint Chiefs.

283
00:13:20,694 --> 00:13:22,462
Yes, ma'am.

284
00:13:43,077 --> 00:13:45,715
Jack was right about Starkwood.

285
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:48,852
You found evidence that
they've been supporting Juma.

286
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,186
Yeah.

287
00:13:50,254 --> 00:13:52,155
Did you find out why?

288
00:13:52,222 --> 00:13:53,957
I mean, what could Starkwood
possibly get from Juma?

289
00:13:54,025 --> 00:13:56,426
The infrastructure to develop
and test biological weapons.

290
00:13:56,493 --> 00:13:58,061
We think they're
holding them somewhere

291
00:13:58,128 --> 00:13:59,829
on the Starkwood compound.

292
00:13:59,897 --> 00:14:01,330
Okay, where's Jack?

293
00:14:02,733 --> 00:14:05,368
He's on his way over here.

294
00:14:06,857 --> 00:14:09,039
What, Larry?

295
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:14,644
He managed to secure
the weapons, but then, uh,

296
00:14:14,712 --> 00:14:16,746
Starkwood got them back.

297
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:19,816
And when that
happened, um...

298
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:24,921
Jack was exposed.

299
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:26,089
He may have
been infected.

300
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:27,857
He's being placed
under quarantine.

301
00:14:27,925 --> 00:14:30,326
Listen, he's on his way here
and we need to find out

302
00:14:30,394 --> 00:14:32,195
everything that he learned
about these weapons.

303
00:14:32,262 --> 00:14:34,297
And I think you should be
the one who debriefs him.

304
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:41,104
And I owe you
an apology.

305
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:43,039
I was wrong not to trust you,

306
00:14:43,107 --> 00:14:47,510
and I-I let my prejudice
about Bauer get in the way.

307
00:14:47,578 --> 00:14:50,446
But...

308
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:53,316
Renee, you should've
kept me in the loop.

309
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,721
You should've
trusted me.

310
00:15:01,425 --> 00:15:03,660
I know.

311
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:06,062
I should have.

312
00:15:13,638 --> 00:15:15,639
When are we moving
on Starkwood?

313
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,343
Aaron?

314
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:22,012
I'll check in
with you guys later, okay?

315
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,080
Thank you.

316
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:27,851
May I speak with
you for a moment?

317
00:15:27,918 --> 00:15:29,185
Of course.
I heard you finished

318
00:15:29,253 --> 00:15:30,987
your debrief and were
on your way out.

319
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:32,321
Yes, ma'am.

320
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:34,490
Well, I need you to stay.

321
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:35,859
Ma'am?

322
00:15:35,926 --> 00:15:38,695
I've been appointed
Acting Chief of Staff.

323
00:15:38,763 --> 00:15:40,930
Secret Service is going
to assign an agent

324
00:15:40,998 --> 00:15:43,166
to handle my
security detail.

325
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:44,567
I'd like that to be you.

326
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:49,438
Well, I'm truly flattered,
ma'am,

327
00:15:49,506 --> 00:15:51,374
but as you know,
I'm retired.

328
00:15:51,441 --> 00:15:53,176
I can have you reinstated.

329
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:55,545
There are plenty
of fine agents

330
00:15:55,612 --> 00:15:57,246
on the roster.
But I don't want them.

331
00:15:57,314 --> 00:15:58,682
I want you.

332
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:02,686
I can't go into
the details now,

333
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:05,188
but the threat to this
country isn't over.

334
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:07,223
We're in the middle
of a crisis,

335
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:09,225
and I need people
around me I can trust.

336
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:13,296
I trust you, Aaron.

337
00:16:13,363 --> 00:16:15,865
I can't say that
about a lot of people.

338
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:18,301
I'm running into a meeting
with the president.

339
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:21,838
I'll assume your
answer is "yes."

340
00:16:30,681 --> 00:16:33,950
Gentlemen, ladies,
please take your seats.

341
00:16:37,387 --> 00:16:39,689
Now, those of you who
haven't had a chance

342
00:16:39,757 --> 00:16:41,191
to finish your briefing packets,

343
00:16:41,258 --> 00:16:43,159
please keep reading.

344
00:16:46,363 --> 00:16:48,164
As we've all
just learned,

345
00:16:48,232 --> 00:16:50,333
this day is not over.

346
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,803
Our national security is
still being threatened,

347
00:16:53,871 --> 00:16:56,305
and we are here
to consider our options.

348
00:16:56,373 --> 00:16:57,807
Mr. Woods.

349
00:16:57,875 --> 00:16:59,508
Your briefing materials

350
00:16:59,576 --> 00:17:01,611
include FBI intelligence
about a cache

351
00:17:01,678 --> 00:17:04,413
of biological weapons on
Starkwood's main compound

352
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:05,815
in Northern Virginia.

353
00:17:05,883 --> 00:17:08,551
This is a recent satellite
view of the compound.

354
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:11,420
Over three square miles,
259 structures--

355
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:12,455
the weapons
could be hidden

356
00:17:12,522 --> 00:17:13,757
anywhere on
the facility.

357
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:14,991
What kind of bioweapons

358
00:17:15,059 --> 00:17:16,126
are we talking about?

359
00:17:17,962 --> 00:17:19,763
This is Ben Landry,
he's director of CDC.

360
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,564
He's here to answer any
questions you may have

361
00:17:21,632 --> 00:17:22,766
in regards to the pathogen.
Ben.

362
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:25,334
I've just received
a preliminary report

363
00:17:25,402 --> 00:17:26,669
from our agents
in the field.

364
00:17:26,737 --> 00:17:29,372
They've identified
the pathogen as a prion variant

365
00:17:29,439 --> 00:17:31,507
indigenous to the East Congo.

366
00:17:31,575 --> 00:17:34,077
It's a form
of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.

367
00:17:34,145 --> 00:17:36,012
It attacks the brain
and the nervous system,

368
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,281
causes dementia,
physical deterioration,

369
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:39,949
ultimately death.

370
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:41,918
Standard CJD kills
within several months,

371
00:17:41,986 --> 00:17:44,254
but this strain
kills more quickly.

372
00:17:44,321 --> 00:17:45,554
How long?

373
00:17:45,622 --> 00:17:46,923
A day, maybe two.

374
00:17:46,991 --> 00:17:48,491
There's no treatment
for this disease.

375
00:17:48,558 --> 00:17:49,959
There's no cure.
If dispersed

376
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:51,127
over a populated area,

377
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:52,595
the results would be
catastrophic.

378
00:17:52,663 --> 00:17:54,898
But it goes
without saying

379
00:17:54,965 --> 00:17:57,533
we cannot allow
a private military force,

380
00:17:57,601 --> 00:18:00,636
these killers, to possess
weapons of mass destruction.

381
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:02,538
We need to find these weapons,

382
00:18:02,606 --> 00:18:05,041
and arrest those bastards
in Starkwood

383
00:18:05,109 --> 00:18:07,343
who are responsible
for bringing them here.

384
00:18:08,846 --> 00:18:10,079
Madam President.

385
00:18:12,283 --> 00:18:15,451
Given the size of the compound,
it would take

386
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:17,653
a considerable force
to locate these weapons.

387
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:20,589
Not to mention the fact
that there are 1,500

388
00:18:20,657 --> 00:18:23,293
highly-trained mercenaries
on that base.

389
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,494
God forbid
they decide to resist.

390
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:28,464
We could have a small war
in our own backyard.

391
00:18:29,381 --> 00:18:31,600
I share those concerns,
Madam President.

392
00:18:31,668 --> 00:18:33,736
We also have to consider
the possibility

393
00:18:33,804 --> 00:18:35,972
that Starkwood might use
these biological weapons

394
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,340
against our own forces.

395
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:38,975
What about an air strike?

396
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:43,313
A facility that large would
require multiple bombing runs.

397
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,048
We'd be looking
at massive casualties

398
00:18:45,115 --> 00:18:46,482
on the Starkwood base,

399
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:48,417
with no guarantee
of destroying the bioweapons.

400
00:18:48,485 --> 00:18:49,485
For all we know,

401
00:18:49,553 --> 00:18:50,519
they've been
buried underground

402
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:51,821
or in fortified facilities.

403
00:18:51,889 --> 00:18:54,123
There's also a risk that
hitting these weapons

404
00:18:54,191 --> 00:18:55,725
with insufficient force
could release the bio-agent

405
00:18:55,792 --> 00:18:56,960
into the atmosphere.

406
00:18:57,027 --> 00:18:58,928
We can't just
ignore the law here.

407
00:18:58,996 --> 00:19:01,904
All these scenarios
would be in violation

408
00:19:02,024 --> 00:19:03,699
of the Posse
Comitatus Act.

409
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:06,535
I mean, we can't deploy
military personnel

410
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:08,704
in a law enforcement
capacity.

411
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:12,108
Not without
congressional approval.

412
00:19:12,176 --> 00:19:13,309
What I'm hearing

413
00:19:13,377 --> 00:19:16,980
is that there are
no good options.

414
00:19:17,047 --> 00:19:19,148
I don't accept that.

415
00:19:20,184 --> 00:19:21,284
Until we find

416
00:19:21,352 --> 00:19:23,152
a way to contain this threat,

417
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:26,389
we are risking another attack
on this country.

418
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:29,458
And that is an option
I won't consider.

419
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:35,731
Mr. Hodges
wants to know

420
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:38,268
if you've given
any thought to his offer.

421
00:19:41,738 --> 00:19:44,874
Why this loyalty to a government
that screwed you over?

422
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,676
I don't get it.

423
00:19:47,744 --> 00:19:48,978
Just tell us

424
00:19:49,046 --> 00:19:51,281
what the FBI knows
and you can walk.

425
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:57,420
For the record,

426
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:59,422
I bet Mr. Hodges a pair
of Redskins tickets

427
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:01,958
you wouldn't talk.

428
00:20:06,196 --> 00:20:07,430
Looks like I'm going
to be sitting

429
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:09,899
on the 50 yard line.

430
00:20:13,103 --> 00:20:15,071
Hey.

431
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:18,841
Hey, what
the hell is going on?

432
00:20:21,778 --> 00:20:23,346
I need your help.

433
00:20:23,414 --> 00:20:25,114
My help?

434
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:27,250
We need to stop this.
It's gone too far.

435
00:20:27,318 --> 00:20:30,453
Look, I'm not going anywhere

436
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,088
until you tell me
why you're doing this.

437
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:40,463
I'm not spending
the rest of my life

438
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:42,932
in prison because Jonas Hodges
has lost his mind.

439
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,600
You know where the weapons are?

440
00:20:44,668 --> 00:20:45,935
Yes.

441
00:20:46,003 --> 00:20:47,770
Then you better
tell me right now.

442
00:20:47,838 --> 00:20:49,605
I want immunity.

443
00:20:49,673 --> 00:20:51,874
Look, I can't promise you
anything.

444
00:20:51,942 --> 00:20:54,143
We can call the FBI
and negotiate a deal,

445
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:56,112
immunity in exchange
for your help

446
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:58,281
in recovering the weapons,
that's the best I can do.

447
00:21:00,317 --> 00:21:02,651
I can set up a secure
landline in my office.

448
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:04,053
Good, let's go.

449
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:16,399
We're pulling up to FBI.

450
00:21:16,467 --> 00:21:18,501
We have to put you
in an isolation suit

451
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:20,669
to transfer you to
the quarantine area.

452
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:22,338
I understand.

453
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:23,672
How are you feeling?

454
00:21:25,642 --> 00:21:27,143
No different.

455
00:21:28,645 --> 00:21:30,480
We have the results
of Mr. Bauer's blood work.

456
00:21:30,547 --> 00:21:31,881
Thank you.

457
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:41,324
Open it.

458
00:21:59,176 --> 00:22:00,076
Thank you.

459
00:22:18,315 --> 00:22:19,282
Excuse me.

460
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:20,516
Larry wanted me
to tell you,

461
00:22:20,584 --> 00:22:22,151
that CDC arrived
with Jack Bauer.

462
00:22:22,219 --> 00:22:23,919
I'll meet them down in quarantine.
He's not in quarantine.

463
00:22:23,988 --> 00:22:26,622
I don't understand.

464
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:27,957
That's all I know.

465
00:22:28,025 --> 00:22:29,625
They just cleared security.
He's on his way up.

466
00:22:39,007 --> 00:22:41,404
Jack, are you okay?

467
00:22:41,472 --> 00:22:43,406
My blood work came
back positive.

468
00:22:43,474 --> 00:22:44,740
I'm infected.

469
00:22:44,808 --> 00:22:47,010
Mr. Bauer, there's a room
for you to change in.

470
00:22:47,077 --> 00:22:49,045
Thank you.

471
00:22:49,113 --> 00:22:51,647
It's fine.

472
00:22:53,683 --> 00:22:56,285
But he's not in quarantine.

473
00:22:56,353 --> 00:22:58,454
We've learned the disease
isn't contagious.

474
00:22:58,522 --> 00:23:00,356
It was engineered that way
to prevent blowback

475
00:23:00,424 --> 00:23:01,857
on the people deploying it.
Okay,

476
00:23:01,925 --> 00:23:02,958
but there has to be something

477
00:23:03,027 --> 00:23:04,827
that you can do
to help him.

478
00:23:04,895 --> 00:23:06,496
There's no cure.

479
00:23:06,563 --> 00:23:07,630
But he's patient zero.

480
00:23:07,697 --> 00:23:08,864
Whatever we learn
from the pathogen

481
00:23:08,932 --> 00:23:10,433
will come from the tests
we still need to run.

482
00:23:12,403 --> 00:23:15,038
Excuse me.

483
00:23:15,105 --> 00:23:18,207
This is Macer.

484
00:23:18,275 --> 00:23:20,510
He's stable for
the moment.

485
00:23:24,148 --> 00:23:26,149
Yeah?

486
00:23:29,853 --> 00:23:31,987
Jack, um...

487
00:23:32,056 --> 00:23:34,457
I don't know what to say.

488
00:23:34,525 --> 00:23:37,060
Then tell me that Agent Moss
followed up on Starkwood.

489
00:23:40,964 --> 00:23:42,898
Sorry.

490
00:23:42,966 --> 00:23:44,900
Larry debriefed the White House

491
00:23:44,968 --> 00:23:46,469
and we're waiting
on the president

492
00:23:46,537 --> 00:23:48,003
to decide on a course of action.

493
00:23:48,072 --> 00:23:49,472
Good.

494
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:50,573
Any word on Tony?

495
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,943
Sorry, we don't know
anything yet.

496
00:23:55,812 --> 00:23:57,980
I need to debrief you

497
00:23:58,048 --> 00:24:00,015
on the canisters that you saw.

498
00:24:00,084 --> 00:24:02,017
You okay with that?

499
00:24:02,086 --> 00:24:03,752
Yeah.

500
00:24:07,124 --> 00:24:08,924
I read the statement

501
00:24:08,992 --> 00:24:11,427
from the Port
Authority cop.

502
00:24:11,495 --> 00:24:13,563
He said that
you risked the mission

503
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:15,631
to save his life.

504
00:24:17,301 --> 00:24:19,935
You did the right thing.

505
00:24:20,971 --> 00:24:23,206
Thanks.

506
00:25:05,382 --> 00:25:07,583
Uh, it's the lab.

507
00:25:08,652 --> 00:25:10,386
It's probably
Hodges.

508
00:25:10,454 --> 00:25:11,887
We should talk to him.

509
00:25:11,955 --> 00:25:13,956
Put it on speaker.

510
00:25:16,126 --> 00:25:18,093
Seaton.

511
00:25:18,162 --> 00:25:19,795
Where the hell have you been?

512
00:25:19,863 --> 00:25:20,829
I've been trying

513
00:25:20,897 --> 00:25:21,830
to reach you.

514
00:25:21,898 --> 00:25:24,167
I was, uh, checking
on Almeida.

515
00:25:24,234 --> 00:25:26,769
Did Stokes get him to talk?

516
00:25:26,836 --> 00:25:28,003
He's still working
on that, sir.

517
00:25:28,071 --> 00:25:30,005
I told him to put
Almeida down

518
00:25:30,073 --> 00:25:31,307
if he didn't
start talking.

519
00:25:31,375 --> 00:25:33,842
I think we should give him
a few more minutes, sir.

520
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:36,187
We're busting our asses to
get these weapons ready

521
00:25:36,307 --> 00:25:38,013
before the government
makes their move,

522
00:25:38,081 --> 00:25:40,983
I want all hands on deck.

523
00:25:41,051 --> 00:25:42,351
We'll be there soon, sir.

524
00:25:42,419 --> 00:25:44,320
See that you are, Greg.

525
00:25:46,089 --> 00:25:47,723
Call FBI.

526
00:25:47,791 --> 00:25:50,059
I need to set up
the secure landline.

527
00:25:50,126 --> 00:25:51,694
Make sure nobody's listening.

528
00:25:51,761 --> 00:25:53,696
All right, well, do it.

529
00:25:55,144 --> 00:25:57,733
I never thought Jonas
would take it this far.

530
00:25:57,801 --> 00:25:59,902
I mean, the man's a patriot.

531
00:25:59,969 --> 00:26:02,205
He founded Starkwood to protect

532
00:26:02,272 --> 00:26:03,539
this country.

533
00:26:03,607 --> 00:26:05,548
Yeah, well,
why is he attacking it?

534
00:26:05,668 --> 00:26:06,933
It's complicated.

535
00:26:07,617 --> 00:26:10,713
I don't understand
it myself.

536
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:13,115
I should've done more
to stop this.

537
00:26:15,052 --> 00:26:15,476
I should've

538
00:26:15,596 --> 00:26:17,086
called FBI months ago.

539
00:26:17,153 --> 00:26:19,555
Well, you're doing
the right thing now.

540
00:26:19,623 --> 00:26:22,057
I've pulled together everything
we have on Starkwood.

541
00:26:22,125 --> 00:26:24,393
Structural specs,
aerial maps,

542
00:26:24,461 --> 00:26:25,961
topography,
company roster,

543
00:26:26,029 --> 00:26:27,129
the whole works.
All right.

544
00:26:27,197 --> 00:26:29,332
Upload it onto
the interagency servers.

545
00:26:29,399 --> 00:26:31,467
Let's get everybody
on the same page.

546
00:26:33,036 --> 00:26:34,537
That's good work, Janis.

547
00:26:34,605 --> 00:26:35,871
Renee...

548
00:26:38,709 --> 00:26:40,309
I heard about Jack.

549
00:26:40,377 --> 00:26:41,844
I'm sorry.

550
00:26:41,911 --> 00:26:43,879
I'm still debriefing him
but I brought a full

551
00:26:43,947 --> 00:26:45,481
description of
the canisters.

552
00:26:45,549 --> 00:26:47,350
All right.

553
00:26:47,417 --> 00:26:49,594
All right, get this out
to the field agents.

554
00:26:50,219 --> 00:26:51,354
How's he doing?

555
00:26:51,421 --> 00:26:54,189
Hard to tell.

556
00:26:56,092 --> 00:26:58,026
Larry, so many people
have died today.

557
00:26:58,094 --> 00:26:59,428
We cannot let their deaths be

558
00:26:59,496 --> 00:27:00,633
for nothing.
We won't.

559
00:27:00,753 --> 00:27:02,898
Larry.
I've got Tony Almeida

560
00:27:02,966 --> 00:27:04,734
on the phone.
Almeida?

561
00:27:04,801 --> 00:27:06,602
He says he's calling
from inside Starkwood.

562
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:09,142
Put him through.

563
00:27:09,262 --> 00:27:10,906
Go ahead, Tony.

564
00:27:10,974 --> 00:27:12,007
Who am I talking to?

565
00:27:12,075 --> 00:27:13,876
It's Larry Moss.
What's going on?

566
00:27:13,943 --> 00:27:15,311
I'm on the Starkwood compound.

567
00:27:15,379 --> 00:27:17,647
I was being held by a man
named Jonas Hodges,

568
00:27:17,714 --> 00:27:19,509
but I was released
by one of his executives.

569
00:27:19,629 --> 00:27:21,717
A man named Greg Seaton.

570
00:27:21,785 --> 00:27:23,218
Now he wants
to cut a deal.

571
00:27:23,287 --> 00:27:24,553
He wants immunity.

572
00:27:24,621 --> 00:27:26,175
What's he offering
in return?

573
00:27:26,295 --> 00:27:28,190
He knows where the weapons
are being held.

574
00:27:29,959 --> 00:27:32,328
All right, Tony, I got to run
this by the president.

575
00:27:32,396 --> 00:27:33,996
Wait, Larry.

576
00:27:34,063 --> 00:27:35,598
Do you know
what happened to Jack?

577
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,267
He's here.

578
00:27:38,335 --> 00:27:40,269
He's in medical.

579
00:27:40,337 --> 00:27:41,837
Was he hit?
No.

580
00:27:41,905 --> 00:27:43,739
One of the canisters
was breached.

581
00:27:43,807 --> 00:27:45,808
He's been infected.

582
00:27:47,003 --> 00:27:49,178
Tony, I got to call
the White House. Stand by.

583
00:27:49,245 --> 00:27:50,613
Janis, set up a secure
connection in the conference

584
00:27:50,681 --> 00:27:52,515
room with Almeida and the White
House for this signature.

585
00:27:52,582 --> 00:27:54,283
And get me the president
on the phone.

586
00:28:17,606 --> 00:28:18,873
What is this?

587
00:28:18,941 --> 00:28:20,875
Footage recovered from Sangala.

588
00:28:20,943 --> 00:28:22,677
It was smuggled out
of the remains

589
00:28:22,745 --> 00:28:26,648
of a biological weapons lab
about 45 minutes ago.

590
00:28:26,715 --> 00:28:30,318
It's a confirmation that
Juma was experimenting

591
00:28:30,385 --> 00:28:33,054
with biological weapons

592
00:28:33,121 --> 00:28:35,089
on the local population.

593
00:28:35,157 --> 00:28:38,023
These poor people
were suffering

594
00:28:38,143 --> 00:28:41,496
from the effects of the
weaponized prion variant.

595
00:28:41,564 --> 00:28:44,666
And that's what
we allowed Starkwood

596
00:28:44,733 --> 00:28:46,701
to bring into this country.

597
00:28:46,769 --> 00:28:48,736
We didn't allow this.

598
00:28:48,804 --> 00:28:51,573
Starkwood is a monster
we created, Olivia.

599
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:54,075
We have been feeding it
for years.

600
00:28:54,142 --> 00:28:56,010
We gave them military contracts.

601
00:28:56,078 --> 00:28:58,012
We relied
on their paid mercenaries

602
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,514
instead of our own soldiers,

603
00:28:59,582 --> 00:29:02,116
outsourced intelligence
gathering operations.

604
00:29:02,184 --> 00:29:03,952
My God, we even passed a law

605
00:29:04,019 --> 00:29:05,620
so that they could build
a military base

606
00:29:05,688 --> 00:29:07,589
13 miles
from the nation's capitol.

607
00:29:07,656 --> 00:29:09,591
You fought against all that.

608
00:29:09,658 --> 00:29:11,392
You've been trying
to limit Starkwood's power

609
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:12,855
ever since you took office.

610
00:29:12,975 --> 00:29:15,597
I didn't do enough...

611
00:29:15,664 --> 00:29:17,632
fast enough.

612
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:20,902
And now it may be too late.

613
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:22,937
Madam President, Tim Woods

614
00:29:23,005 --> 00:29:24,606
and Admiral Smith
are here to see you.

615
00:29:24,673 --> 00:29:26,674
Send them in.

616
00:29:29,712 --> 00:29:31,646
Madam President, Larry Moss
at FBI is calling in.

617
00:29:31,714 --> 00:29:32,680
He says it's urgent.

618
00:29:32,748 --> 00:29:34,148
Put him through.

619
00:29:34,216 --> 00:29:36,217
Agent Moss,
the president's here. Go ahead.

620
00:29:36,284 --> 00:29:37,685
Madam President,
we've been contacted

621
00:29:37,753 --> 00:29:39,721
by someone inside
Starkwood.

622
00:29:39,788 --> 00:29:41,723
Ma'am, it's Tony Almeida.

623
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:43,391
Almeida?

624
00:29:43,458 --> 00:29:45,493
He's been working with Jack
Bauer to recover these weapons.

625
00:29:45,561 --> 00:29:47,529
He was taken captive
but then released

626
00:29:47,596 --> 00:29:49,130
by someone on the inside.

627
00:29:49,197 --> 00:29:50,832
His name is Greg Seaton.

628
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:53,134
He's part of Jonas
Hodges' inner circle.

629
00:29:53,201 --> 00:29:54,802
Ma'am, he says
he's willing to tell us

630
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:57,171
where the weapons are
in exchange for immunity.

631
00:29:57,239 --> 00:29:59,173
Now, I've already started
mobilizing

632
00:29:59,241 --> 00:30:00,742
for a targeted raid.

633
00:30:00,809 --> 00:30:02,076
We can catch 'em by surprise

634
00:30:02,144 --> 00:30:03,110
and lock down
these weapons.

635
00:30:03,178 --> 00:30:04,478
But I'm going to
need you to sign

636
00:30:04,547 --> 00:30:05,747
an immunity agreement
for this man.

637
00:30:05,814 --> 00:30:06,814
How confident

638
00:30:06,882 --> 00:30:08,315
are you of Seaton's intel?

639
00:30:08,383 --> 00:30:09,918
We believe it's genuine, ma'am.

640
00:30:10,786 --> 00:30:11,786
Madam President,

641
00:30:11,854 --> 00:30:13,320
we may not get a chance
like this again.

642
00:30:13,388 --> 00:30:15,222
Admiral Smith?

643
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:16,558
I concur,

644
00:30:16,625 --> 00:30:18,359
but I would suggest
we supplement the FBI

645
00:30:18,427 --> 00:30:19,727
with a seal squad.

646
00:30:19,795 --> 00:30:21,162
They're ready to move
on my order.

647
00:30:21,229 --> 00:30:22,702
The attorney general
will raise hell

648
00:30:22,822 --> 00:30:24,732
about us involving the military
in this operation.

649
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,734
We'll deal with him later.

650
00:30:26,802 --> 00:30:28,235
Agent Moss, you have

651
00:30:28,303 --> 00:30:31,238
my direct authorization
to move on Starkwood.

652
00:30:31,306 --> 00:30:33,240
How soon can you be ready?

653
00:30:33,308 --> 00:30:35,076
We've already drafted
an executive pardon,

654
00:30:35,143 --> 00:30:36,878
and set it up via WebEx.

655
00:30:36,946 --> 00:30:39,847
You'll be able to give a secure digital 
signature and we're good to go.

656
00:30:39,915 --> 00:30:42,349
We have the document set up
at your assistant's computer.

657
00:30:51,393 --> 00:30:53,360
Agent Moss,

658
00:30:53,428 --> 00:30:54,696
the president
is prepared to sign.

659
00:30:54,763 --> 00:30:56,097
Go ahead, ma'am.

660
00:31:01,136 --> 00:31:03,638
All right,
it's done.

661
00:31:03,706 --> 00:31:05,039
Tony, did you get
the signature?

662
00:31:05,107 --> 00:31:06,074
Yeah, we're good.

663
00:31:06,141 --> 00:31:08,175
When can you be
at Starkwood?

664
00:31:08,243 --> 00:31:10,011
We can be there
in ten minutes.

665
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:11,813
Agent Moss, thank you.

666
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,114
And good luck.

667
00:31:13,181 --> 00:31:14,148
Thank you, ma'am.

668
00:31:14,216 --> 00:31:16,684
Let's go.

669
00:31:16,752 --> 00:31:18,753
Madam President, we may have
just caught a lucky break.

670
00:31:18,821 --> 00:31:20,421
Until this plays out,

671
00:31:20,489 --> 00:31:23,357
I want everyone to keep looking
for other options.

672
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:33,567
All right, Mr. Seaton.

673
00:31:33,636 --> 00:31:35,569
Go ahead.

674
00:31:35,638 --> 00:31:37,605
The weapons are
in a warehouse

675
00:31:37,673 --> 00:31:40,274
on the northeast quadrant
of the compound.

676
00:31:40,342 --> 00:31:43,444
32, 44.23 north...

677
00:31:43,512 --> 00:31:46,380
117, 10.42 west.

678
00:31:47,716 --> 00:31:50,284
Mr. Seaton, it would help
to have someone on the ground

679
00:31:50,352 --> 00:31:51,418
doing recon.

680
00:31:51,486 --> 00:31:53,121
Can you get Tony
to that warehouse?

681
00:31:53,188 --> 00:31:54,255
I think so.

682
00:31:54,322 --> 00:31:55,823
See if you can get ahold
of a hand radio.

683
00:31:55,891 --> 00:31:56,858
We'll be on 480 kilohertz.

684
00:31:56,925 --> 00:31:58,526
All right, we'll be there.

685
00:31:58,593 --> 00:32:01,295
If we land here, we'll be within
50 yards of the warehouse.

686
00:32:01,363 --> 00:32:02,329
Yeah, support
teams here

687
00:32:02,397 --> 00:32:03,330
and here.
Shore us up.

688
00:32:03,398 --> 00:32:05,332
Coordinate
with the navy.

689
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,035
Get moving.
I'll meet you upstairs.

690
00:32:07,102 --> 00:32:08,317
Let's move!

691
00:32:11,273 --> 00:32:12,874
You're mobilizing.
What's going on?

692
00:32:12,941 --> 00:32:14,909
We got a call
from Tony.

693
00:32:14,977 --> 00:32:16,978
He's working with an informant
inside Starkwood.

694
00:32:17,046 --> 00:32:18,379
We got a location
on the weapon,

695
00:32:18,446 --> 00:32:19,547
we're getting ready
to stage

696
00:32:19,614 --> 00:32:21,315
a raid on the compound.
I want to go.

697
00:32:21,383 --> 00:32:23,785
I can understand why,
but I'm sorry.

698
00:32:23,852 --> 00:32:25,319
I can't allow it.
Larry, I can help you with this.

699
00:32:25,387 --> 00:32:26,487
I'm the only one who's
seen the canisters,

700
00:32:26,555 --> 00:32:28,355
I know exactly what
we're looking for.

701
00:32:28,423 --> 00:32:29,390
I read your debrief.

702
00:32:29,457 --> 00:32:31,726
You gave us all the
details we need.

703
00:32:31,794 --> 00:32:34,580
Larry, please, I've earned this.

704
00:32:36,198 --> 00:32:37,965
Jack, I know

705
00:32:38,033 --> 00:32:39,801
what you've done today,

706
00:32:39,868 --> 00:32:41,169
the sacrifice you've made.

707
00:32:41,236 --> 00:32:43,571
Uh, under any
other circumstances,

708
00:32:43,638 --> 00:32:46,040
I'd want you out there
with us, but you're sick,

709
00:32:46,108 --> 00:32:47,308
and we have no idea

710
00:32:47,375 --> 00:32:49,077
when you're going to
start showing symptoms.

711
00:32:49,144 --> 00:32:50,745
I cannot risk
that happening

712
00:32:50,813 --> 00:32:52,046
out in the field.

713
00:32:52,114 --> 00:32:54,082
I need my best men
for this operation.

714
00:32:56,484 --> 00:32:58,186
I hope you can understand that.

715
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:04,092
You're right.

716
00:33:05,961 --> 00:33:07,962
You're right.

717
00:33:10,332 --> 00:33:12,499
Yeah.

718
00:33:12,567 --> 00:33:15,502
I always knew eventually
we'd agree on something.

719
00:33:18,006 --> 00:33:20,141
I'm so sorry, Jack.

720
00:33:56,947 --> 00:33:59,048
Mr. Seaton?
Murphy, I need

721
00:33:59,116 --> 00:34:00,880
to check the personnel that...

722
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,414
That's it.

723
00:34:33,374 --> 00:34:36,219
The weapons are
inside there.

724
00:34:36,286 --> 00:34:38,320
How many men inside?

725
00:34:38,388 --> 00:34:41,224
Hodges, munitions team,
security.

726
00:34:41,291 --> 00:34:43,592
I'm guessing a
dozen or more.

727
00:34:47,164 --> 00:34:49,632
Wolves are at the door, Tommy.

728
00:34:49,699 --> 00:34:51,634
How much longer?

729
00:34:51,701 --> 00:34:53,736
We're still an hour away
from being armed, sir.

730
00:34:53,804 --> 00:34:56,139
We just intercepted
a government transmission.

731
00:34:56,206 --> 00:34:58,440
FBI is on the way.

732
00:34:58,508 --> 00:35:01,844
Sir, we haven't even run
the sequence checks yet.

733
00:35:01,912 --> 00:35:03,579
Let's do it!

734
00:35:03,647 --> 00:35:06,082
Oh, damn it.

735
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:12,955
What's our ETA?

736
00:35:13,023 --> 00:35:15,124
Two minutes, sir.

737
00:35:15,192 --> 00:35:16,826
Tony, it's Larry Moss.

738
00:35:16,894 --> 00:35:18,227
Are you in position?

739
00:35:18,295 --> 00:35:19,528
Affirmative.

740
00:35:19,596 --> 00:35:21,998
We're about 50 yards
north of the warehouse.

741
00:35:22,065 --> 00:35:23,833
What can you tell me?

742
00:35:23,901 --> 00:35:26,002
Got two entrances,
north and south.

743
00:35:26,069 --> 00:35:27,804
Heavy steel doors.

744
00:35:27,871 --> 00:35:30,206
Two guards armed
with automatic weapons.

745
00:35:30,274 --> 00:35:32,541
Seaton says there's probably
about a dozen inside.

746
00:35:32,609 --> 00:35:34,710
We have to assume
they're armed, as well.

747
00:35:34,778 --> 00:35:36,212
All right.
We're almost there.

748
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:38,114
I'm gonna need your eyes
on the ground in case

749
00:35:38,182 --> 00:35:39,315
there's any resistance.

750
00:35:39,382 --> 00:35:40,516
Copy that.

751
00:35:40,583 --> 00:35:41,818
Aerial One to home base.

752
00:35:41,885 --> 00:35:43,886
Target has been confirmed.
We are go

753
00:35:43,954 --> 00:35:46,655
for Tac plan Alpha.
Copy that, Aerial One.

754
00:35:46,723 --> 00:35:48,691
All feeds are live.
We're monitoring your approach.

755
00:35:53,263 --> 00:35:55,298
Sir, we're being signaled
by Starkwood's air tower.

756
00:35:55,365 --> 00:35:56,699
Let me talk to them.

757
00:35:58,601 --> 00:35:59,335
You're on.

758
00:35:59,402 --> 00:36:00,569
This is Special Agent

759
00:36:00,637 --> 00:36:02,038
Larry Moss from FBI.

760
00:36:02,105 --> 00:36:03,906
We have an executive order

761
00:36:03,974 --> 00:36:05,341
from the president
of the United States

762
00:36:05,408 --> 00:36:07,176
to search one of your buildings.

763
00:36:07,244 --> 00:36:09,478
FBI? I'll need
to get authorization

764
00:36:09,546 --> 00:36:10,646
from my superior.

765
00:36:10,714 --> 00:36:11,814
We have sent you

766
00:36:11,882 --> 00:36:13,649
a digital copy
of the executive order.

767
00:36:13,717 --> 00:36:14,984
Check your wireless frequency.

768
00:36:15,052 --> 00:36:16,152
That is all

769
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:18,054
the authorization
you will need.

770
00:36:18,121 --> 00:36:20,756
Make no attempt to interfere,
or you will be arrested.

771
00:36:20,858 --> 00:36:22,124
Do you understand?

772
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:25,261
Do you understand?

773
00:36:25,329 --> 00:36:26,628
Understood, FBI.

774
00:36:26,696 --> 00:36:29,065
Take us in.

775
00:36:30,367 --> 00:36:32,301
Aerial One to home base.

776
00:36:32,369 --> 00:36:33,535
We're good to go.

777
00:36:33,603 --> 00:36:34,703
Copy that, Aerial One.

778
00:36:34,771 --> 00:36:35,972
Looks like
you have got a clean approach.

779
00:36:36,039 --> 00:36:37,206
No hostiles in sight.

780
00:37:42,539 --> 00:37:43,505
You all right?

781
00:37:43,573 --> 00:37:44,873
We have a medic.

782
00:37:44,942 --> 00:37:46,275
I'm fine.

783
00:37:46,343 --> 00:37:49,412
Seaton, I need you
to stay behind us.

784
00:37:49,479 --> 00:37:51,480
Let's go.

785
00:38:13,536 --> 00:38:14,670
Stand down!

786
00:38:15,653 --> 00:38:17,506
You were told to stand down!

787
00:38:17,574 --> 00:38:20,609
Lower your weapons
and get on the ground now!

788
00:38:21,711 --> 00:38:23,468
Lock them down!

789
00:38:30,954 --> 00:38:33,055
It's locked, sir.

790
00:38:33,123 --> 00:38:34,390
Blow it.

791
00:38:40,178 --> 00:38:41,197
Blasting!

792
00:38:41,264 --> 00:38:44,333
Three. Two. One!

793
00:38:46,269 --> 00:38:48,070
Go. Go!

794
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:04,753
Where are the weapons?

795
00:39:04,821 --> 00:39:06,571
I don't know.

796
00:39:06,691 --> 00:39:08,324
What do you mean,
you don't know?

797
00:39:08,392 --> 00:39:09,925
Almeida was threatening
to kill me.

798
00:39:09,993 --> 00:39:11,827
I told him
what he wanted to hear.

799
00:39:11,895 --> 00:39:13,729
You lying son of a
bitch! You came to me!

800
00:39:13,796 --> 00:39:15,597
Now, where are
the weapons?!

801
00:39:15,717 --> 00:39:18,600
Where are the damn weapons?!
Tell him to take his hands off of me.

802
00:39:18,668 --> 00:39:21,504
Tony? Tony! I need you
to stand down now!

803
00:39:21,571 --> 00:39:23,172
You're not getting away
with this.

804
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:24,507
Secure him!

805
00:39:26,743 --> 00:39:28,177
He's lying, Larry.

806
00:39:29,702 --> 00:39:31,914
He played me.

807
00:39:31,981 --> 00:39:33,682
Yeah, I know.
It looks that way.

808
00:39:46,196 --> 00:39:48,830
Well, what do you know?

809
00:39:48,898 --> 00:39:51,133
Little old Seaton
bought us some time.

810
00:39:51,201 --> 00:39:55,204
They're on the other
side of the compound.

811
00:39:55,272 --> 00:39:58,441
We just have
to keep them there.

812
00:40:24,634 --> 00:40:26,868
There's nothing here, sir.

813
00:40:29,973 --> 00:40:31,407
Renee, the warehouse is empty.

814
00:40:31,475 --> 00:40:32,975
Tony's informant

815
00:40:33,042 --> 00:40:34,076
sent us to the wrong location.

816
00:40:34,144 --> 00:40:36,078
This whole thing
was a diversion.

817
00:40:36,146 --> 00:40:38,180
They couldn't have
gotten them out that fast.

818
00:40:38,248 --> 00:40:39,715
The weapons are
there somewhere.

819
00:40:39,782 --> 00:40:41,317
Larry, the weapons have to be

820
00:40:41,384 --> 00:40:42,485
inside of Starkwood.

821
00:40:42,552 --> 00:40:43,885
Tell them to
keep looking.

822
00:40:43,953 --> 00:40:45,988
Stand by.

823
00:40:48,077 --> 00:40:50,326
All right, everyone
outside now.

824
00:41:06,109 --> 00:41:08,043
All right, listen up.

825
00:41:08,111 --> 00:41:09,612
We're going
to do a point-by-point

826
00:41:09,679 --> 00:41:11,947
search of this entire compound.

827
00:41:12,015 --> 00:41:13,882
Good.

828
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:15,784
I want four teams sweeping

829
00:41:15,852 --> 00:41:17,853
every structure
on this property.

830
00:41:25,262 --> 00:41:26,228
Jack.

831
00:41:28,498 --> 00:41:29,431
Hold your fire!

832
00:41:30,467 --> 00:41:32,168
Hold your fire.

833
00:41:36,139 --> 00:41:37,506
Hold your fire.

834
00:41:37,574 --> 00:41:39,141
Stay in position.

835
00:41:41,411 --> 00:41:42,944
Tell Larry to have
his men stand down.

836
00:41:43,012 --> 00:41:45,447
Are you kidding me? They just
drew on federal forces.

837
00:41:45,515 --> 00:41:46,748
If you don't want to lose
your men, you'll get them

838
00:41:46,816 --> 00:41:47,949
to stand down now. Now!

839
00:41:50,053 --> 00:41:52,054
Hold your fire!

840
00:41:58,061 --> 00:41:59,127
That's far enough.

841
00:42:04,301 --> 00:42:07,002
We cooperated
with your demand

842
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:08,937
to search this building.

843
00:42:09,005 --> 00:42:10,105
Now, we're asking you to leave.

844
00:42:10,173 --> 00:42:11,273
There are biological

845
00:42:11,341 --> 00:42:12,441
weapons on this facility.

846
00:42:12,509 --> 00:42:14,109
We're not going anywhere
without them.

847
00:42:14,177 --> 00:42:15,648
Now, tell your men
to stand down.

848
00:42:15,768 --> 00:42:17,479
Those charges are absurd,

849
00:42:17,547 --> 00:42:19,981
and we're not going to
let you keep searching.

850
00:42:20,049 --> 00:42:21,617
You're on private property,

851
00:42:21,685 --> 00:42:23,999
and we're prepared
to defend it if necessary.

852
00:42:24,119 --> 00:42:26,455
You are threatening
federal agents.

853
00:42:26,523 --> 00:42:28,457
Stand down! Now!

854
00:42:28,525 --> 00:42:29,725
We're protecting our rights

855
00:42:29,792 --> 00:42:31,293
against a hostile
government that's using

856
00:42:31,361 --> 00:42:34,029
false charges to
try to shut us down.

857
00:42:34,097 --> 00:42:35,931
Now, we don't want
any bloodshed.

858
00:42:38,201 --> 00:42:41,803
But if you try
to advance any farther,

859
00:42:41,871 --> 00:42:44,340
you will be fired upon.
