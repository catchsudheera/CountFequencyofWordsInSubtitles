1
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,711
Everything that's happened today, from
the infected body to Salazar's prison break,

2
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,075
has been part of an elaborate sting operation.

3
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:25,870
<i>Some Ukrainian scientists were trying to sell
a weaponized virus on the open market.</i>

4
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,235
<i>I suggested the Salazars as potential buyers.</i>

5
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,278
<i>Our goal was to remove
the virus stockpile from the marketplace.</i>

6
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:35,194
<i>But all of this hinged on me convincing
the Salazars that I had switched sides.</i>

7
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,748
Tell me how the man who betrayed us
is now our friend.

8
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:43,198
Bauer came to me with an opportunity to
make more money than we ever dreamed of.

9
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,477
- What's in it for you, Jack?
- 15 million dollars.

10
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:49,393
I would never have thought
that Jack Bauer was for sale.

11
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:54,669
You said you'd take me away from here.
Do you remember, Jack?

12
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:55,829
Yes, I remember.

13
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,516
There was one small thing
you forgot to mention - you were a cop.

14
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,239
Even that wouldn't matter
if you'd meant what you said to me.

15
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,880
I meant everything I ever said to you.

16
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:11,956
For the next few hours, all of our resources
are dedicated to helping Jack get this virus.

17
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:15,112
Tony, I spoke to Chase.
He's not coming back to CTU.

18
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,955
- He still thinks my father was captured.
- And he thinks he's going in to rescue Jack.

19
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,316
Dammit, he'll blow Jack's cover
and we'll lose this virus.

20
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,119
I know this man. He's Bauer's partner.

21
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,875
- What the hell's going on, Jack?
- Shut up. You shouldn't have followed me.

22
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,269
- You're with them?
- Yes, I'm with them.

23
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,753
- Jack?
- Shut up, Chase.

24
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,638
You wanna get through this, just shut up!

25
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:45,557
- The transponder on Jack's watch went dead.
- Dammit!

26
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:49,315
By the time the assault teams are in position,
we'll have no idea where he is.

27
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:09,828
The president will make a brief statement.
There will be no questions at this time.

28
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,879
My fellow Americans, good evening.

29
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:24,316
A few hours ago
I had to terminate a presidential debate

30
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,678
in order to handle what was at the time
a national security threat.

31
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:32,719
I can't reveal to you at this time
the details surrounding the situation.

32
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,951
Those will be forthcoming
in the next few hours.

33
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:40,238
Let me assure you that the danger
that existed a few hours ago has passed.

34
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,796
America is safe.

35
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,348
The American people are safe.

36
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:49,395
I apologize to my opponent, Senator Keeler,

37
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:54,474
and to the millions of you expecting
to see the two of us engage in the issues.

38
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,437
The debate will be rescheduled.

39
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:00,479
I'd like to thank you all for your patience
and understanding. Good night.

40
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,515
Mr President...

41
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:07,072
There are rumors that this crisis was
manufactured to protect Dr Anne Packard.

42
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,549
How do you respond to that, sir?

43
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,678
Those allegations were false.

44
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,718
Senator Keeler's charges were unfounded
and we have proof.

45
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,110
Proof that comes directly
from Anne Packard's ex-husband.

46
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:27,320
In fact, in the next few weeks, Senator Keeler
will have his own explaining to do.

47
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:33,030
Anne Packard
is an individual of the utmost integrity.

48
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,317
- She didn't deserve this.
- Mr President...

49
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,871
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
That's it. No more questions.

50
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:45,272
Bauer's with the Salazar brothers in Mexico.
His transponder signal stopped working.

51
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,794
We're doing all we can to re-establish contact.

52
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,633
Tell the Delta units to hold their position.

53
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,631
All right, thanks.

54
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:59,076
- Let's try an amplification module.
- I cycled through it three times.

55
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:02,869
- It's not a weak signal, there's no signal.
- What do we think happened here?

56
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,315
Jack's cover might have been blown.

57
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,870
There's no indication his transponder's
been found or his cover blown.

58
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:12,430
Maybe he can't get a signal
or the transponder's broken.

59
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,034
Damage might have knocked it
to another frequency.

60
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,712
- Let's run a scan.
- I am.

61
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,758
I'm a third of the way through the spectrum,
but so far no luck.

62
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,434
All right, I'll get you some help.

63
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,393
- Kim?
- Yes, Tony?

64
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,596
- Do you know how to do a frequency scan?
- Yeah.

65
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,194
We want to pick up
your father's transponder signal.

66
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,475
Michelle's begun it. Coordinate with her.

67
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,996
- What's the signature?
- I already told you, 30 over five.

68
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,991
You didn't tell me.

69
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,073
Look, Kim, I know this is hard on you,
your father's life being at stake.

70
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,436
- But I need you to focus, OK?
- Sorry.

71
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,475
All right, good. Call me if anything changes.

72
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,548
Why are we stopping?

73
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,949
Tomás says there's no sign
of anyone following.

74
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:12,318
Until we know more,
we're better off staying here.

75
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,239
Could he have come here on his own,
without backup?

76
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:20,278
Maybe he came by himself to rescue you.

77
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,679
How sad.

78
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:25,036
Does it bother you that your partner's
going to die trying to save you?

79
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,076
It breaks me up.

80
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,993
This man Amador should have called
to set up the meeting.

81
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,992
He's gonna call.
Make sure you've got your money ready.

82
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,878
<i>The money's ready.</i>

83
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,909
- Yeah?
- It's Amador.

84
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,797
<i>- We're ready.
- Where?</i>

85
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,030
Put Bauer on the phone.
I only deal with him.

86
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,110
<i>- This is Jack.
- Hello, Jack.</i>

87
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,795
Five kilometers north of town,
a trail splits off the road into the woods.

88
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:11,793
- Take it for two kilometers, 15 minutes.
- Got it.

89
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,633
The meeting's north of here. 15 minutes.

90
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,038
Hey, wait. The phone.

91
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,712
- What if he calls back?
- I'll take a message.

92
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,669
Look at you, Jack. You are a mess.

93
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:35,394
- We gotta get you straight.
- I'm not gonna fix.

94
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,590
Take them. You'll feel better.

95
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,351
I need to use the bathroom.

96
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,111
They're in the back.

97
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,033
- I want you to get some sleep.
- I'm not tired.

98
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,270
I'll wake you when it's time to leave.

99
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,112
- Where's Hector?
- He's busy.

100
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,033
You'll see him tomorrow morning.

101
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,680
Go to sleep.

102
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,671
I love you.

103
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,797
Claudia, stay down, stay down.

104
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,917
I need you to listen to me.

105
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,276
Hector and Ramón are trying to buy a virus
to use as a weapon.

106
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,918
Millions of people could die.

107
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,516
I've set up this deal so my government
can destroy the virus. Do you understand?

108
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,478
- You're still with CTU?
- Yes, I'm still with CTU.

109
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,312
But you broke Ramón out of prison.

110
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,073
So I could gain his trust,
to make the deal happen.

111
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,833
I cannot allow this virus
to get into the wrong hands.

112
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,709
You betrayed us once.
Now you'll betray us again?

113
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,839
- No, them, not you.
- I was a fool to believe any of it.

114
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:07,469
"I'm going to protect you,
get your family somewhere safe." All lies.

115
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,676
I wanted to come back for you earlier.

116
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,115
When I heard about this virus,
I had to deal with it.

117
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:16,910
Millions of lives are at stake.
You have to understand that.

118
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,629
But I can get you out now.
You, Sergio and your father.

119
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:26,039
- How?
- American soldiers are not far from here.

120
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:30,432
They're waiting for my signal. I can't reach
them because my transmitter's destroyed.

121
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:34,559
Claudia, I have nothing to gain
from telling you this if it's not the truth.

122
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,995
One word from you and I'm a dead man.

123
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,551
What do you want me to do?

124
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:46,996
First I need a cellphone.
I need to let CTU know where I am.

125
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:51,710
Then I need you to do whatever you can
to help my partner Chase. Keep him alive.

126
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:55,475
- When Hector realizes, he's gonna kill me.
- You'll be gone by then.

127
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,915
Chase can help you get out. I promise.

128
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:03,230
But if I can't contact CTU, this is all
for nothing. You've gotta get me that phone.

129
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,756
- Please.
- I'll do what I can.

130
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,798
I have to go.
They're waiting for me.

131
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:29,549
If you're lying to me again, I'll kill you myself.

132
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,316
Help Chase.

133
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,879
Jack Bauer broke Ramón out of prison.

134
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:57,236
Your people are sending forces
to bring them back.

135
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,231
When are they coming?

136
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,196
When?

137
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,039
And where?

138
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,435
Get Ramón.

139
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,556
Aargh!

140
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,959
He was your partner.
You must be feeling something.

141
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:39,558
I got a 15-million-dollar payday
when this deal goes down. He's on his own.

142
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,871
Is he as tough as you?

143
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,712
He still believes in the lie.

144
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,953
- What lie?
- That what he's doing has purpose.

145
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,351
Belief is a beautiful thing.

146
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,912
Hello.

147
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,154
- Where are you going?
- Please.

148
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,959
- No, don't leave.
- No.

149
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,278
<i>- Mi amor.
- Sit down for a minute.</i>

150
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,475
Ramón is waiting, OK?

151
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,596
All right. All right.

152
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,669
Claudia.

153
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,678
- I left my phone inside.
- I'll get it.

154
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,954
<i> Let's go.</i>

155
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,994
- Chloe, have you heard from Chase?
- No.

156
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,913
Are there alternate frequencies
he might use to contact you?

157
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,912
Yeah, and they're on autoscan.
He hasn't checked in.

158
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,594
I know you're busy.
Maybe we can reach him by satellite.

159
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,558
Satellite. I didn't think of that
I'll get right on that.

160
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:53,394
You don't have to be sarcastic with me.
This is someone I care about.

161
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,313
Get a grip.

162
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,277
I have to update the president.

163
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,193
I don't wanna tell him
we're still in the same place - nowhere.

164
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:04,592
I don't want excuses.
Just get me the answer, all right?

165
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,558
- I need to finalize the com file.
- It should have been done.

166
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:11,158
I need the format code.
You said you'd download it.

167
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:15,552
- Delta-733-Golf.
- That's the code from the previous file.

168
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,159
Delta-723-Bravo.

169
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,229
- Thank you.
- All right.

170
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,831
- Did you get it?
- Yeah, I got it.

171
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:34,435
Eight minutes shot to hell on an invalid code.

172
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,632
Access granted.

173
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:48,717
That could have been a disaster. Without
those files, we can't track the rescue teams.

174
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,238
<i>Come.</i>

175
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,997
Bad news. CTU lost track of Jack Bauer.

176
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,991
- Is he in trouble?
- We don't know.

177
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:14,117
- Does he have the virus yet?
- We don't know that either.

178
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,350
<i>Come.</i>

179
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:21,634
Mr President,
I have Alan Milliken on the line for you.

180
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,196
I'll take it.

181
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,794
- Alan?
- David.

182
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,077
- You angry with me?
- Of course I'm not angry with you.

183
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,630
Your first time in LA in three years
and you don't even call.

184
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:47,038
- It's been a bad day, Alan.
- I know. I've been watching the news.

185
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,430
I don't want to add to your burdens,
but I'd like to come by and see you.

186
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:55,913
- See me?
- David, I wouldn't ask if it weren't important.

187
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,755
I know you're busy. After all,
you are the President of the United States.

188
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,956
In large part, thanks to you.

189
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,957
I'll come to you, Alan.
I'll be there in 15 minutes.

190
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,474
Thank you, David. And one more thing.

191
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,514
As a personal favor to me,

192
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,591
I'm asking you not to bring Wayne.

193
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,552
- May I ask why?
- It's something I'd rather explain in person.

194
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,351
All right.

195
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,670
Where are we?

196
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:39,390
So far we've been unable to pick up Jack
on any of our imagery.

197
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,272
How long we been out of contact?

198
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:46,478
His tracking beacon went dead
27 minutes ago.

199
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,632
- Last known location?
- Here.

200
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:52,280
He can't be much farther
than 30 miles in any direction.

201
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:57,309
- Unless he was choppered out.
- No way. Air Tactical's watching the skies.

202
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,389
Where's Bauer?

203
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:05,074
We don't know yet.

204
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,752
That's great.

205
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:11,755
This entire operation, which hinges on Jack
being on site when they deliver the virus,

206
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,912
is going down the tubes
because we don't know where he is.

207
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,118
- How does that happen?
- Ryan, you want to chew us out, do it later.

208
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,351
- We're trying to get this back on track.
- I will.

209
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,034
You better find Bauer
and make this thing work.

210
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,078
Otherwise, the two of you and Jack,
assuming he's still alive,

211
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,515
are gonna take the fall for everything today.

212
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:36,152
From the prison riot to Salazar's escape
and every dead body in between.

213
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:44,115
So what happens
if Jack goes to this meeting without backup?

214
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,316
The Salazars get the virus.

215
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,516
What happens from there?

216
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,473
I don't know.

217
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,470
Feeling better?

218
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,312
I'm fine.

219
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,554
Amador.

220
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:29,630
Hello, Jack. So these must be the buyers
you're representing.

221
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:32,518
This is Hector and Ramón Salazar.

222
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:38,836
There's 100 million dollars in escrow
accounts in Geneva and Hong Kong.

223
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,559
We'll give instructions
to have the money transferred

224
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,518
when we have confirmation
that the virus has been delivered.

225
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:48,115
There's been a complication.
Another buyer's interested in the virus.

226
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,668
- What? We have a deal.
- What's going on, Jack?

227
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,478
I had nothing to do with it.

228
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,950
This is a new development
that's surfaced in the last few hours.

229
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,190
We'll auction the virus to the highest bidder.

230
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,191
- You son of a bitch!
- No!

231
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:05,314
Mr Salazar,
I merely represent the wishes of my client.

232
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:09,513
- May we have a moment?
- Of course.

233
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:16,153
Hector, this does not need to be a problem.

234
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,435
- It's a huge problem.
- Think it through.

235
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,476
Add 50 million dollars to this price tag

236
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,552
and you're still looking
at over an 800-million-dollar profit.

237
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,712
You said you could move the virus
for a billion dollars, right?

238
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,712
- Something like that.
- You've come this far. Don't stop.

239
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,392
Let it play out.

240
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,831
The other buyer's here.

241
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,634
You know her?

242
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,718
What the hell is he doing here?

243
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,439
- That man is a federal agent.
- I know who he is, Nina.

244
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,909
- Everything's fine.
- It's not. He's setting us up.

245
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,195
You have to kill him. Kill him!

246
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,038
The first man who fires gets cut down.
That's a promise.

247
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:25,350
- Why is he here?
- He represents a buyer, Nina, just like you.

248
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,079
No, he doesn't. Believe me, I know him.

249
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,515
Whatever's he's told you, he's lying.

250
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:34,798
I don't work for CTU any more, Nina.
I work for myself.

251
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,111
- I'm out of here.
- Nina, please.

252
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,475
Let her go and honor the original agreement.

253
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:47,438
Nina, I don't think
your client's gonna be too happy

254
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,557
if you walk out
and let the virus go to another buyer.

255
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,916
We gotta close this deal.

256
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:02,236
We have a wide perimeter
and we're monitoring every frequency.

257
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,676
There's no law or military
within 25 kilometers.

258
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,351
You know how I work.

259
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,351
This area's completely secure.

260
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,151
If I had the slightest doubt, I wouldn't be here.

261
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:22,070
I suggest we all take a few minutes
to calm ourselves.

262
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:26,438
And I'll explain the ground rules
and we'll proceed with the bids.

263
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,431
Agreed?

264
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,471
Agreed.

265
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,550
<i>-  Fine.
- Good.</i>

266
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,478
- David.
- Alan, it's good to see you.

267
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:40,599
- Thanks for finding the time to fit me in.
- You've always made time for me, Alan.

268
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:43,069
Even when there was
no obvious reason to do so.

269
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:46,197
Your potential was always obvious, David.

270
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:49,556
- How are you doing?
- I could use a few new body parts.

271
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:52,632
- But besides that...
- You look well.

272
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:59,795
I know you're wondering what could be
so important that I'd ask you here.

273
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,519
So I'll be brief and I'll be blunt.

274
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,511
I want your brother off the team.

275
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,955
I don't understand.
You were supportive of Wayne.

276
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,873
I was. I'm not any more.

277
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,718
What's this all about, Alan?

278
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,830
<i>- Yes, sir?
- Tell my wife to come in here.</i>

279
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,831
<i>Right away, sir.</i>

280
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,631
- Julia.
- Mr President.

281
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,239
David is wondering
why I want him to fire Wayne.

282
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,440
And I thought you should explain.

283
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,430
As you know,
I've known Wayne for some time.

284
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:55,075
Three years ago,
when he was president of Alan's company,

285
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:58,436
we began to spend
quite a bit of time together.

286
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,476
Get to it, Julia.

287
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,512
Wayne and I became involved.

288
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:08,354
They had an affair
while I was recuperating from the stroke.

289
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,115
That's how your brother thanked me.

290
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,669
Go on.

291
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:23,596
We saw each other for a year, before
you asked him to join your administration.

292
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:26,353
- Then we broke it off.
- Hold on.

293
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:32,392
- If you knew, why didn't you say something?
- I didn't.

294
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,994
I just found out recently.

295
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,876
Did you know, David?
Did you keep it from me too?

296
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,030
Of course not.

297
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,475
- I can hardly even believe it's true.
- It's true.

298
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,196
- I've told you how sorry I am.
- You can go.

299
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:59,797
I waited for you to come to Los Angeles
so I could do this face to face.

300
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:03,759
I gave your brother my company
and he took my wife.

301
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:07,193
Now I'm taking away his job.

302
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,310
Wayne is my chief of staff, my closest friend.

303
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:16,679
- I trust him.
- I don't. Neither should you. He's dishonest.

304
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:20,269
I think you'll agree, David,

305
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:25,593
that you wouldn't be where you are
without my support over the years.

306
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:30,879
I've never asked you for anything in return,
but I'm asking you now.

307
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,871
Fire Wayne.

308
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:37,352
I'm sorry, Alan, I can't do that.

309
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:46,912
I'm disappointed, but not surprised.

310
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:51,552
You know me well enough
not to be surprised by repercussions.

311
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:54,200
I hope you're not threatening me.

312
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:58,353
I don't make threats, David.
I just tell it like it is.

313
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:02,278
You let me know if you change your mind.

314
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:18,037
Have them open up the field search
to these coordinates. Tell them it's priority.

315
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:21,237
Sorry, I don't mean to interrupt,
but can I see you for a minute?

316
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,878
Do you have enough to go on?

317
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,679
I'll let you know
if the satellite guys give me trouble.

318
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:31,635
- What is it?
- It's actually about Tony.

319
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:36,032
Look, I don't know if he's...

320
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,316
You don't know if he's what?

321
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,435
I don't know if he's well enough to do his job.

322
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:46,195
He was shot a few hours ago.
He's not gonna be working at full capacity.

323
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:49,113
I know,
but what if he misses something important?

324
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,668
- I mean, he's running things.
- What happened?

325
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:57,357
He asked me to finalize the com files,
but he forgot to give me the format codes.

326
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:01,319
And he chewed me out for forgetting
something he thought he told me,

327
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,789
except he never told me.

328
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,916
He's under a lot of stress. We all are.

329
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,911
That's my point.

330
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:11,877
Michelle, you're his wife,
but you're also second in command.

331
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:14,758
If Tony can't do the job,
somebody has to tell Chappelle,

332
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:17,798
and I think that someone should be you.

333
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,231
- What are you doing?
- Taking a rest.

334
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:43,039
There's oil under Hector's truck.
It needs to be fixed before Hector gets back.

335
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,791
Now!

336
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,676
OK, I'll check it out.

337
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:20,073
Here. I have a message from Jack.
Can you hear me?

338
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:24,119
Things aren't what they seem.
Jack isn't really with Ramón and Hector.

339
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:27,431
Everything he's done
has been to earn their trust.

340
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:32,913
The virus they're going to buy, Jack is going
to take it from them. Do you understand?

341
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,355
There are soldiers from your country nearby.

342
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,834
- They'll come when Jack calls for them.
- Claudia?

343
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:43,071
Jack promised to get me and my family
out of here if I help you.

344
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:47,950
- Then help me.
- I can't now. There are too many men around.

345
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:52,033
Don't give up. I'll figure out a way, all right?

346
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,668
Each party will make one final bid in writing.

347
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:05,228
Amador wants to start
in the next ten minutes.

348
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:08,232
You have to come up with a number.

349
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,915
We are offering 100. She must have
made him an offer to make this worthwhile.

350
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,629
- Say another 50.
- So we go 175.

351
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:18,109
More. If we do this, we do it to win.

352
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,232
At least 200.

353
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,276
Make the calls.

354
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,950
Who is she?

355
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,915
- I told you, she worked for me at CTU.
- No.

356
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,117
There's more between you and this woman.

357
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,955
She killed my wife.

358
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:55,193
Is this going to be a problem, Jack?

359
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,071
No.

360
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,071
No problem.

361
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,796
- Where are we going?
- We'll be together.

362
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,871
We're together now.
Is Hector coming?

363
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,793
- Sergio, just be ready to leave.
- What about Hector...

364
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:29,431
Sergio, forget about Hector!
Just do what I'm telling you!

365
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,476
What are you going to do?

366
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:55,155
Jack said if I help his partner
he'll get us out of here, Papa.

367
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:59,199
These people - Ramón, Hector, Jack Bauer -
you can't trust any of them.

368
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:02,511
Jack's not like Ramón and Hector.

369
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:06,832
Papa, please,
this is our chance to get out of here.

370
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,715
Then go.

371
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,078
No.

372
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:15,071
No, we're all going.

373
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,515
No, I'm not going without you.

374
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:34,113
What about Landsat Alpha-39?

375
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,310
Yeah. That's about it, right? Thanks.

376
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:47,354
I checked the NSA logs. There's no satellites
in the area we think Jack's in.

377
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,512
I'll check the flight paths just in case.

378
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,353
Just in case what? I just checked it.

379
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,710
There have been other mistakes today, Tony.

380
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:02,990
Mistakes? That you think I made?

381
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:05,719
Sweetheart,
you should still be in the hospital.

382
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,268
- You should step down.
- I'm fine.

383
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:11,158
- After what you've been through...
- I just said I'm fine.

384
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,674
End of discussion, please.

385
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,155
Tony, I've got something. NSA has
a satellite we may be able to reposition.

386
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,515
We just have to ask for access.

387
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,196
- All right, thanks.
- Yeah.

388
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,555
<i>... also I'd like to redo that email</i>

389
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:44,189
<i>and determine how best to use
these resources for this compressed divert.</i>

390
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:47,431
<i>As for the information packets,
they have online synoptic...</i>

391
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:50,318
- Yes?
- I need to talk to you, Ryan.

392
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,197
<i>- I think it's best...
- Hold on.</i>

393
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,077
I don't think Tony should be here.

394
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,469
My understanding is
he's not in imminent danger.

395
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,437
No, it's not that.

396
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:05,035
I've had reports he's been forgetful.
Missing things.

397
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:08,438
- Like what?
- Key information. Format codes.

398
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,556
Things that are causing delays.

399
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:17,875
On any other day I wouldn't be worried about
this, but I'm not sure if he's up to it today.

400
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:22,351
If I pull him now, that sets us back too.
No one can replace what he does.

401
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:25,398
He, Gael and Jack
have been working this from the beginning.

402
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:28,870
- If you think his mistakes are significant...
- I do.

403
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,793
Or else I wouldn't be bringing this to you.

404
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,437
All right. Just let me wrap up this call
and I'll get into it.

405
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,431
Thank you.

406
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:51,272
<i>- You need to make it happen.
- We're working on it, sir.</i>

407
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,998
All right. Thanks.

408
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:55,389
I just got back from seeing Alan.

409
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,710
- What did he want?
- I think you know.

410
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:02,439
- Know what, David?
- He wants me to fire you.

411
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:06,718
What the hell were you thinking,
carrying on an affair with a married woman?

412
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:10,429
- The wife of my biggest supporter.
- Listen, I am sorry.

413
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:13,956
- But it was a mistake and I corrected it.
- Not in Alan's mind.

414
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:16,918
For him, this is fresh.

415
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,470
He just found out
and he wants to make you pay.

416
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:26,669
We both know you can't afford
to make an enemy out of Alan.

417
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:30,594
He wields too much power, so I'll resign.

418
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:34,673
You'll leave only if I decide
it's the right thing to do, not Alan Milliken.

419
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:39,995
David, Alan is a very dirty fighter, trust me.

420
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,230
Sure you want to get down
in the gutter with him?

421
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,834
You haven't left me much choice, have you?

422
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,988
- You want to see me, Ryan?
- Yeah.

423
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:16,755
What's going on?

424
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:21,391
I asked you here because your competency
has been brought into question.

425
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,550
By whom?

426
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,717
By me.

427
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,473
- An employee had some concerns...
- An employee?

428
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,471
Kim Bauer.

429
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,232
I felt I needed to address them.

430
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:36,198
With Ryan? You didn't come to me first?

431
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,350
- I tried to talk to you.
- That's enough.

432
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:42,353
The point is, Ryan, that they're wrong.
I am fit for duty, completely.

433
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:48,270
All right. When you entered the room,
the monitor was on.

434
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,271
Tell me what it showed.

435
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:01,155
On the left side
was a C-TAN schematic of the country,

436
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:05,711
indicating an ongoing investigation
in Florida, New York and Montana.

437
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:09,475
On the right side was an all-clear report
from the Austin branch.

438
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:15,037
That's correct. But it still doesn't ease
my mind considering the slips you made.

439
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,035
- What slips?
- Michelle?

440
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:23,592
You thought you gave Kim the signature
on the frequency scans. You didn't.

441
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,951
Not verbally, no.

442
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:29,077
I put them on her in-screen
15 minutes before I talked to her.

443
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,878
Anything else?

444
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:35,477
She said you didn't load the format codes
onto the grid in time.

445
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:38,757
No, I didn't load the format codes
onto her grid.

446
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:43,069
I put them in the shared volume, on time.
Check it.

447
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,436
It's there.

448
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,670
All right. I'm sorry, Tony.

449
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,910
- We're done here.
- Good.

450
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:17,274
You've wasted time we don't have.

451
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,756
Are you ready with your bids?

452
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,592
- Yes.
- Yes.

453
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,511
Let me see them.

454
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:33,398
The banks will verify
the presence of these funds?

455
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,828
Yes, that is correct.

456
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:50,314
The bank will verify those as well.

457
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:55,558
Your bid is 225 million dollars.

458
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,272
Hers is 240.

459
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:03,555
Nina, you win.

460
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,948
You are a dead man.

461
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:11,316
My people will escort you out.

462
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:17,391
The transfer will take place in two hours.

463
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,560
You said would deliver the virus
and you didn't.

464
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,596
Not now, Hector. Come on.

465
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:32,110
I'll be contacting you with the details.

466
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,998
Excellent. We'll be waiting for your call.

467
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,150
Let's go.

468
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:02,992
You can't let Nina Myers just walk away.
Put a man on her.

469
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,389
- Shut up.
- Ramón, listen to me.

470
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:08,597
If Nina gets away she'll disappear.
You'll never find her again.

471
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:11,399
You had your chance, Jack.

472
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,878
All right. This is good enough.

473
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:52,588
- Ramón, please. You're making a mistake.
- Get out.

474
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:56,753
- Look, I can explain. I didn't know that...
- Get out!

475
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:01,275
You're of no use to us any more! You failed!

476
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,191
Hector, don't do this!

477
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,110
Ramón, think this through.

478
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,510
What about your buyers around the world
that you promised the virus to?

479
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:15,390
They'll know you were double-crossed and
did nothing about it. What will you tell them?

480
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:18,199
"I'm sorry,
we'll try and get it right next time?"

481
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:22,432
The Salazar name will be a joke.
You can't let that happen.

482
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,958
Come on!

483
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:29,909
Five hours ago you were in prison.
Now you're free because I broke you out!

484
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,195
Then I brought you the deal of a lifetime.

485
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:35,559
What do I have to do
to prove to you I'm on your side?

486
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:42,272
This deal can still happen.
We can get the virus.

487
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:45,079
- How do you get the virus?
- I told you.

488
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:47,594
- The woman, Nina.
- The woman? She's the problem.

489
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:51,514
- She outbid us.
- I know her. I trained her. I can get to her.

490
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:54,068
- You don't even know how to find her!
- I'll find her!

491
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,515
Please, Ramón. You can't lose here.

492
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,916
If I fail, you get to kill me. Fine.

493
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:04,791
But if I succeed, the deal will go forward.
We'll be back on track. We'll all get paid!

494
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:07,999
Please.

495
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:17,512
Hector, let's play this out a little longer.

496
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,388
The man has more lives than a cat.
