24 - Season 7
Episode 22

4
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:12,840
Previously on 24...

5
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:16,220
Agent Walker told me
that there's a chance...

6
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:19,520
a small chance that I could help you.

7
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:24,410
I'm dying. And whatever small chance
there is to stop that from happening

8
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:29,270
it is not worth the pain for me to
let you sit there and watch me die.

9
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,720
Daddy, I don't want to lose you.

10
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:35,530
- Come here.
- I don't.

11
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:37,500
What is it?

12
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:40,220
Sweetheart, I'm sorry,

13
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,380
but you need to go.

14
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:44,240
Hodges was behind everything
that happened today,

15
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:47,110
from the planes going down to the
attack on the White House. - What?

16
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:49,860
He's also responsible for
the death of my brother.

17
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:52,640
All you need to know
is Hodges worked a deal.

18
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:54,460
Witness Protection.
My mother approved it

19
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:57,660
and he's going free...
unless someone intervenes.

20
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,520
I'll get you contact information, a price

21
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,410
and instructions on how
to transfer the funds.

22
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:06,610
Martin, it's Olivia Taylor,
I spoke to the contact,

23
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:08,450
but I couldn't go through with it.

24
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,480
Listen to me, Jibraan.

25
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,450
If you don't do exactly as I say,

26
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:23,100
you're going to watch your younger
brother die right in front of your eyes.

27
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,310
And then...

28
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:28,050
I'm gonna kill you, hmm?

29
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:30,360
It was the Americans who
killed our parent Hamid.

30
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:31,510
I'm going to make them pay.

31
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:32,740
What have you done to my brother?

32
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:35,030
You've poisoned his mind.
This isn't my brother.

33
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:36,600
We're looking for a
man who worships here.

34
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:39,950
His name is Jibraan Al-Zarian.
Do you know him?

35
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:42,540
I know him, but he is not a terrorist.

36
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,430
We did not come here to debate
this with you! Where does he live?!

37
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:48,730
You come into a house of worship with
information you should not have,

38
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:50,410
an outrageous accusation,

39
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,820
no legal warrant and threaten me.

40
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,920
I have not threatened you.

41
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:58,910
Not yet, but we both
know where this is going.

42
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,080
Jack, it's Chloe. I found something weird
about these hits on Jibraan Al-Zarian.

43
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:03,400
You know how I said that the $2.000.000

44
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:06,170
was deposited into his account
over a period of six months?

45
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,820
Well, that wasn't right.
They were backdated.

46
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:09,550
What about the extremist
Web sites he was visiting?

47
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:11,210
Same thing with the time stamps.

48
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,060
The hits were backdated 30 minutes ago.

49
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:15,060
Jibraan could be innocent.

50
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:16,600
What do you have, Agent?

51
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,730
Armed hostile in the back
room holding a hostage.

52
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,460
- What about Almeida?
- He's not in there.

53
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:22,690
See for yourself.
Is that who you're looking for?

54
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,670
- No.
- It's Jibraan's brother Hamid.

55
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,390
They're using him as leverage
to make Jibraan do what they want.

56
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:30,860
- How can you be sure?
- Because that's what I would have done.

57
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:39,660
Hamid, stop! Put it down.

58
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:41,940
We're FBI. We need him alive.

59
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:46,380
The following takes place
between 05:00 A.M. and 06:00 A.M.

60
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:53,010
The canister's being retrofitted
to maximize dispersion.

61
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:57,060
We're on target to release the bioweapon at
Washington Central Station within the hour.

62
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:59,470
Your casualty estimates are holding up?

63
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,940
I think they're conservative.

64
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:04,740
A significant portion of the pathogen will
escape into the station's ventilation system,

65
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,790
which will circulate it for us.

66
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:10,370
Between 8.000 and 10.000
commuters will be exposed.

67
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:13,120
Tell me about Mr. Al-Zarian.
Is he compliant?

68
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:17,240
Yes. His primary concern at this
point is for the safety of his brother.

69
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:20,620
All right. What's his level of
awareness regarding the plan?

70
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:23,770
He won't know anything about
the canister until it's too late.

71
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:27,140
Good. We'll talk once it's done.

72
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:40,940
Trigger mechanism's working.

73
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:03,370
This device will tell me
where you are at all times.

74
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:07,300
It will also allow us
to talk to each other.

75
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:09,340
Talk about what?

76
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,070
You still haven't told
me what you want me to do.

77
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,530
Right now I just want
you to get on the subway

78
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:17,450
and take the Red Line all
the way to Washington Center.

79
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:19,660
And when I get there?

80
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:22,070
I'll let you know then.

81
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,500
I'm not stupid.

82
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:27,460
I know you are going to
blame me for something.

83
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,690
- Jibraan...
- What's your plan, huh?

84
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,880
You are going to hurt people?

85
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:37,260
Jibraan, the only person you need to
worry about right now is your brother.

86
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:40,800
You follow my instructions,
and Hamid lives.

87
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:44,340
You do something stupid, and he dies...

88
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:47,630
badly. Understood?

89
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,700
Good.

90
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:55,390
Red Line, westbound, to
Washington Center, got it?

91
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,600
Let's go. Come on.

92
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,910
Sorry this had to happen like this.

93
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:27,490
We will find your brother.

94
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:35,690
You should talk to him.

95
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,070
Kid doesn't know anything,

96
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:43,020
except that his brother was taken
by Tony about a half an hour ago.

97
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:45,970
He didn't overhear anything
about a target or the time frame.

98
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:48,340
Right now, he's our only lead.

99
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,550
He's badly injured. I don't know
if he's in any condition to talk.

100
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:51,550
My God!

101
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:53,930
Hold his head. I'm going
to give him some morphine.

102
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:57,520
No, you're not.

103
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,810
His wound is in the
middle of a nerve cluster.

104
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:01,120
He can go into shock from the pain.

105
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:04,030
I know. Back off.

106
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:15,770
You should step out of the room.

107
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,060
Do what you need to do.

108
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:22,360
Where's Almeida?

109
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,490
Please, just give me the morphine.

110
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:27,170
I'll give you the morphine as soon
as you talk. Where's Tony Almeida?

111
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,220
- What's the target?
- I don't know...

112
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,500
- What's the target?!
- I don't know!

113
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:36,110
I'm telling you the truth!

114
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,720
My job was just to watch the
kid and monitor things here.

115
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:41,710
Almeida didn't tell me where he
was going or where the target is.

116
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:43,460
How do you contact him?

117
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,250
I can't.

118
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:50,340
Okay, okay. I have a number.

119
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:53,170
But I'm not supposed to use
it unless there's a problem.

120
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:55,830
You better start thinking of one fast.
Where is his phone?

121
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,560
I have it here.

122
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:02,330
Give him enough morphine so that he can
take the pain out of his voice. Nothing more.

123
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:05,380
I want you to get Chloe to
run a trace on this number.

124
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:08,120
Tell her to feed it
back to our cell phones.

125
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:16,650
You better start thinking
about what you're going to say.

126
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,420
You try and screw with me on this,

127
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:21,120
it'll be the last thing you ever do.
You understand me?

128
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:25,920
- Do you understand me?
- Yes.

129
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,640
- Janis Gold.
- It's Renee.

130
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:31,830
I need Chloe to run a peer-to-peer
cellular trace from a GSM I.D.

131
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,860
I can do that.

132
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:35,250
Jack asked for Chloe to run point on this.

133
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:37,040
What's the number?

134
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:39,660
- Alpha-Charlie-3316.
- Got it.

135
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:41,410
I'll need you to run it
backthrough to me and Jack.

136
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:42,620
Hold on.

137
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,700
- She's working on it.
- Good.

138
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:49,020
I'll open up the locate protocol.
You establish a secure VPN.

139
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:51,780
All right, opening a
channel on the Inter-Sat...

140
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:54,880
- Why would you do that?
- What?

141
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:57,760
You know connecting through a
DMA node would be a lot faster.

142
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,810
No, I don't know it's
quicker to use a DMA node

143
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,320
or else I would have done just that.

144
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:03,530
I had no idea the DMA
nodes were up and running.

145
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:07,050
Really? Because they've been up
and running for about two years.

146
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:11,470
It's obvious I'll never be able to
do things as well as you did at CTU.

147
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:15,850
All I ask is that you not make me feel like
an idiot while you're pointing that out.

148
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:19,370
All right.

149
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:23,590
Agent Walker, the trace is up and
running whenever you're ready.

150
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,140
- Jack.
-Chloe, I'm on.

151
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,460
You ready?

152
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:33,400
What's the number?

153
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:37,000
202... 555...

154
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:40,260
0147.

155
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,930
It's ringing.

156
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:48,910
- Why are you calling me?
- I was checking Al-Zarian's computer,

157
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:52,120
- double-checking everything we planted.
- And?

158
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:54,420
The bank that we use in
Switzerland just e-mailed him,

159
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:57,750
rejecting one of the transfers
we made in Al-Zarian's name.

160
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,670
You know how to resubmit it?

161
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,940
I'm not sure

162
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:02,140
Are you getting this?

163
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,500
Tony's got something on his phone
that's encrypting his location.

164
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:06,620
I'm trying to get around it.

165
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:10,370
All right. Call our man in Zurich.

166
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,120
He'll walk you through it.

167
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:14,920
All right. I just wanted to get
your authorization before I did that.

168
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:17,410
Any other problems?

169
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:20,210
- No.
- Good.

170
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,440
Chloe, did you get that?

171
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:23,290
I didn't have time to
decrypt all the location data.

172
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:26,330
All I know right now is that he's
somewhere in the Adams Morgan district.

173
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:28,590
We're running out of time.
We're going to have to narrow that down.

174
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,290
I'm trying. I have to decrypt
the rest of the location data.

175
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:33,430
- How long is that going to take?
- I don't know.

176
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,410
Damn it, Chloe, we've got
to do better than that.

177
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:36,550
I need to get off the phone.

178
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:39,280
Janis, I want you to contact Metro P.D.

179
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,920
I want you to get them
to move their Hazmat teams

180
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,240
and their Tactical teams
over to Adams Morgan.

181
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:45,550
We're on our way now. Let's go.

182
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:08,040
Metro passengers, this weekend there will be no
Blue Line Express service to Arlington and McClean.

183
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:11,580
Express service will
be resumed on Monday.

184
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:15,780
- I need you to call the police.
- Excuse me? Speak up, sir.

185
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:19,050
I can't do that. They're listening.

186
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:20,130
Who's listening?

187
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:22,760
The people who have my brother.

188
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:25,970
The terrorists.

189
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:28,750
They're going to kill my brother
unless I do what they say.

190
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,340
They want me to get on this train.

191
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,600
That's it? Just get on the train?

192
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,030
Yes, please. You have to help me, okay?

193
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,580
You have to call the police.

194
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,330
Is there a problem here, sir?

195
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,360
Yes, yes, thank you, officer.
Please, I need your help.

196
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:47,420
Sir, just calm down and step this way.

197
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:50,210
What is it?

198
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,920
Listen, they have my brother hostage.
Okay, you have to believe me!

199
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:57,030
Put the earpiece back in.

200
00:11:57,260 --> 00:12:01,040
- What?
- I said, put the earpiece back in.

201
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,390
Now.

202
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:18,570
Listen, Jibraan, I
understand you had to try.

203
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,880
But don't do it again.

204
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,550
Your brother's life depends on it.

205
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:25,260
Yes, okay, please, okay, just
don't hurt him, okay?

206
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:26,850
Well, that's up to you.

207
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,050
Yes, I'll do whatever you say, okay?

208
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,490
I won't cause any more problems.
I promise.

209
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,290
All right.

210
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:35,550
Do you remember your instructions?

211
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:37,380
Yes, uh...

212
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:40,620
Westbound Red Line to Washington Center.

213
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:45,530
We'll be watching.
We're always watching.

214
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:19,040
Hello?

215
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:21,710
Ms. Taylor, this is Agent Pierce.

216
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,570
Yes, Aaron?

217
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,630
Secretary Woods was asking for you.

218
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:27,600
You told me you were
retiring to the residence,

219
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:30,750
but upstairs detail confirmed
that you're not there.

220
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,200
Why is Tim looking for me?

221
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:35,890
The Justice Department is investigating
the Jonas Hodges car bombing.

222
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:40,160
They're requesting phone and internet records
and want to interview everyone as well.

223
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:42,660
I didn't realize Justice
was getting involved.

224
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:45,630
Apparently, there were only 11
people who knew Hodges was alive.

225
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,610
It stands to reason that
information was leaked.

226
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:51,810
- Okay, I'll get there as soon as I can.
- Where are you?

227
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:54,610
I needed to run a personal errand.

228
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:57,540
Ma'am, am I to understand that
you've left the White House premises

229
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:59,840
without Secret Service protection?

230
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,800
I won't be long, Aaron. Ten minutes.

231
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:03,310
Ms. Taylor,

232
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:06,070
this is a serious breach of protocol.

233
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:09,250
Your safety is my responsibility.

234
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:10,470
Aaron, I know.

235
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:12,730
I promise you it won't happen again.

236
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:15,190
Just cover for me till I get back?

237
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,520
Will you do that for me, Aaron?

238
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,200
- Yes, ma'am.
- Thank you.

239
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,770
This is a mistake, Martin.
We shouldn't be meeting.

240
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:34,160
Okay, you need to calm down, Olivia.

241
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:36,530
I needed to see you;
you were hysterical on the phone.

242
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:39,520
No, you don't understand!
There's an investigation.

243
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:42,820
The Justice Department is 
asking about my whereabouts!

244
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:46,580
Okay, did you think no one would bat an
eye when a government witness was murdered?

245
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:49,130
I told you I changed my mind.

246
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:50,660
I didn't transfer the funds.

247
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:54,940
The man you put me  touch with said he
wouldn't act until he received payment.

248
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:58,130
Why would he go ahead and
kill Hodges if he wasn't paid?

249
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:00,540
Because I told him to.

250
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:01,830
What?

251
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:04,500
He called me and told me the
money hadn't come through yet.

252
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:06,950
I told him you were
good for it and to proceed.

253
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:08,370
Why, Martin?
Why would you do that?

254
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,340
Hodges was going into
Witness Protection,

255
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:13,030
there was a finite
window of opportunity.

256
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:15,890
And because it's what you wanted.
Right?

257
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:18,470
Despite all my warnings
for you to reconsider,

258
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,980
you looked me straight in the eye

259
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:23,440
and you said you wanted Hodges
dead, to make it happen.

260
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,760
And I did, and he's dead.

261
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:30,340
Oh, my God...

262
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,820
But my phone records...m-my
computer... everything...

263
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,120
Don't worry about any of those.

264
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:36,750
I'll send you a program to
erase your internet tracks.

265
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:38,680
The calls to me mean nothing.

266
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,130
Olivia, the time to worry
about your conscience

267
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:45,450
was before you put this in motion.

268
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,720
If you let this eat away at you,

269
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,210
people are going to
notice and get suspicious.

270
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,780
You will bring us both down...

271
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:56,590
destroy your mother and her
administration. Think about it.

272
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,400
- Is that what you want?
- No.

273
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:02,160
Okay,then pull yourself together.

274
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:07,830
I promise you, this will all
pass if you do what I say.

275
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,240
Can you do that?

276
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:13,370
Say it.

277
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:16,230
I can do it.

278
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:21,380
You need to transfer the funds, Olivia.

279
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:24,860
You do not want this
man unhappy with you.

280
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:38,590
- Hey, honey.
- Sorry I woke you.

281
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,980
No, no, no, that's okay. I've been
up with Teri a couple times anyway.

282
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:43,850
She's been having a rough night.

283
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,270
I think she misses her mother.

284
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:49,170
Oh, well, listen, I just called to let
you know that my flight's been delayed.

285
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:51,240
Yeah, how long?

286
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:54,300
Well, they're saying an hour.
Which probably means two.

287
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:56,410
Okay.

288
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:59,950
- What? - I don't know, maybe
you should see this as a sign.

289
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:01,720
A sign?

290
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:04,320
That you should stay there...
try to convince your father

291
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:08,120
that, uh, he should be spending whatever
time he has left with his only dauter.

292
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:10,590
As much as I want to,

293
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:14,640
he made it very clear that he does
not want me around to watch him die.

294
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:17,630
Okay, all right. Sorry I brought it up.

295
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,640
Teri and I will be at
the airport to pick you up.

296
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:24,250
Wha... Oh... My battery is dying.

297
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:26,720
Is the hospital okay with that?

298
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:29,030
Yeah, I talked to Kevin.
He said he'd cover my rounds.

299
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:32,030
Well, that's-that's... that's great.
Well, I can't wait to see you guys.

300
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,320
- Love you.
- Okay, bye.

301
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:45,340
- Oh, excuse me, sorry.
- That's all right. Sorry.

302
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:48,460
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, yeah, sorry.

303
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:19,390
This stop, L Street. This stop, L Street.

304
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:46,010
Next stop, Washington Center.

305
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:50,950
Next stop will be the last one.
Next stop Washingto Center.

306
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:55,430
The package is in place.

307
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:59,080
The dispersal mechanism is set to go off
while the train is stopped at Washington Center.

308
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:02,520
Good, we're on the move.
I'll pick you up at 22nd.

309
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,520
Jack, I unlocked Tony's location data.

310
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:15,440
Where is he?

311
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:18,450
Three blocks immediately
south of your position on 22nd.

312
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,210
Where exactly on 22nd?

313
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,450
West side of the block
you're coming up on.

314
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,670
900 feet ahead of you...

315
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,800
800 feet...

316
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:29,850
All teams, bring your units up from
the south and prepare to move in.

317
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:31,040
You probably got him.

318
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:34,010
- Okay, we've got him.
- Suspect is in a black van.

319
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:37,590
We can't let this turn
into a pursuit. Hold on.

320
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:44,250
Hold on!

321
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,940
Tony was trying to destroy some
kind of device when I grabbed him!

322
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,850
I got it!

323
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,770
Lock down this piece of crap.

324
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,290
What do u got?

325
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,810
Some kind of mobile computer,
but he damaged it pretty badly.

326
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:18,200
This has got something
to do with the attack.

327
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:19,580
Contact Chloe, see what we can find.

328
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,660
I'm gonna sweep the
van for the canister.

329
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:45,080
Tony's UMPC device is
damaged everywhere I look.

330
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,080
I don't think there's a way
to get it back up and running.

331
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:48,560
Well, then try a partial reconstruct.

332
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:50,430
Anything that can help us find
out what Tony's been up to.

333
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:53,110
At this point I don't even know
about our chances of even doing that.

334
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,040
- Chloe.
- I know.

335
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:57,240
Do me a favor. Send me your screen.

336
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:59,530
- Why?
- Why not?

337
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:08,740
What?

338
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:12,960
Looks like I can reconstruct the memory
state of the UMPC at the time it was damaged.

339
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:14,660
No. There isn't enough intact data.

340
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,560
Yeah, there, in the PROM module.

341
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:19,500
A lot of handheld devices back
up their memory state there.

342
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,530
That can't be done, not
without the file headers.

343
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:23,770
Really?

344
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:26,180
Mr. Bauer, Almeida just
regaet consciousness.

345
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:29,040
Thank you. Stay with this.

346
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:41,040
I need you to walk away.

347
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:45,760
Please, can you and
your men just walk away.

348
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:00,580
Where is it?

349
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:03,490
Where's the canister?

350
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:07,730
I am not going to stop until
you tell me where it is.

351
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:19,960
Why did you betray me?

352
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:24,200
Why?

353
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:29,900
I have nothing left to lose.

354
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:34,890
You either tell me where that canister is,
or so help me God,
I will lay you down right here right now

355
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:39,600
You think I've got anything left to loose Jack?

356
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,540
Do it.

357
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:55,500
There were a number of applets running.

358
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,340
We should be able to run them on our hardwe.

359
00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:00,100
I'm uploading a mirror to you now.

360
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,240
You should have it.

361
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,700
You think it's Jibraan?

362
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:07,710
I can't tell. But whoever it is, they're
southbound on Connecticut at 30 miles an hour.

363
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:11,780
And they just went right through
St. Matthew's Cathedral and out the other side.

364
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:14,370
He's got to be on the Metro.

365
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:18,560
Yes, the Red Line ending
at Washington Center.

366
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,360
Washington Center's the target.

367
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,600
Put these in the car.

368
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:28,030
Jack, we have Jibraan.

369
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:53,220
Jibraan is on the Metro,
headed toward Washington Center.

370
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:55,940
Chloe, it's Jack. I'm back on comm.
How much time do we have?

371
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:57,620
Not long. He's almost there.

372
00:23:57,620 --> 00:24:00,420
Okay, listen. Tony had to be able
to communicate with Jibraan somehow.

373
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:04,150
See if they were using some kind of comm frequency
that was strong enough to work in the subway.

374
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:06,950
Looking... okay.

375
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:09,470
Wait. There's a proprietary K-band running.

376
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:12,290
That's it. Okay. Patch me through.

377
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:14,600
Go ahead, Jack.

378
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:19,170
Jibraan? Jibraan my name is
Jack Bauer. Can you hear me?

379
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:20,510
Uh, yes.

380
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:22,260
Your brother is safe.
I'm working with the FBI.

381
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:26,580
The man who was holding him hostage
has been taken into custody.

382
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:27,820
Let me talk to Hamid.

383
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:29,120
He's not with us right now.

384
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,800
No, no. I need to talk to him.

385
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:34,090
Jibraan, listen to me.
Your brother is safe, but you are not.

386
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:37,870
The people who are doing this,
they gave you some kind of a package.

387
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:41,440
No, no, no.
They didn't give me anything.

388
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,600
We've got real time
coverage of the station.

389
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,780
Jibraan, these people are trying
to frame you for a terrorist attack.

390
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:50,370
They had to give you
some kind of a package.

391
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:55,680
Then it's got to be on the train. I want you
to start looking for an abandoned suitcase,

392
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,550
gym bag, knapsack, anything like that.

393
00:24:57,550 --> 00:24:59,940
No, I can't tell. There's nothing.

394
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:03,420
It's got to be there. Keep looking.

395
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:06,800
There was a woman.

396
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,770
What woman?

397
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:11,090
She was with them when, uh,
when they took Hamid.

398
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:12,820
I think maybe I saw her get off the train.

399
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:15,400
Are you pulling into the station right now?

400
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,720
Uh, yes.

401
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:22,180
Okay, I want you to stay on the train and
wait for all the passengers to get off.

402
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,000
It's a bomb, isn't it?

403
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,290
It's a biological weapon. If it goes off,
a lot of people are going to die.

404
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:49,570
Are all the passengers off the train?

405
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:50,700
Yes.

406
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:53,580
- Can you see the package?
- I don't know.

407
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:58,430
Jibraan, keep looking.
It's got to be there.

408
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,380
Jibraan?

409
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:04,680
Yes, yes. I see it.
I see a duffel bag.

410
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:07,380
I need you to open it.

411
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:11,940
Wait. Why me?
W-W-Why must I do this?

412
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,360
'Cause right now,
you're the only person that can

413
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,760
and if you don't,
thousands of people are going to die.

414
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:19,250
Jibraan, I need you to open the bag.

415
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:23,430
Look, I know I'm asking you a lot.

416
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:25,840
Please.

417
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:32,230
Jibraan, are you still there?

418
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:35,030
It looks like a bomb.

419
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:37,440
I-I see a light.

420
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,450
It's a timer.
It's counting down.

421
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:41,060
How much time is left?

422
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:42,460
Uh, two minutes, ten seconds.

423
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:44,460
That's not enough time
for us to get down to you.

424
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:45,920
I want you to try and
get the device outside.

425
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:48,310
There's an escalator to your right.
I want you to start moving now.

426
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:51,800
Start moving now.
I'll meet you on the street.
We're about a minute out.

427
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,940
Okay.

428
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:14,720
That's him. Hold on!

429
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,750
- Hold on. What's the hurry?
- I have to get out. I have to get out.

430
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:17,890
What is that?

431
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:20,680
Is that even yours?

432
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,710
I have a bomb! Okay?

433
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:29,070
This is a bomb. Get back!
Everybody, get back!
Get back! I have a bomb!

434
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:47,720
Wait, he's with us. Jibraan!

435
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:50,550
Jibraan. I'm the man who was
talking to you. Give me the canister.

436
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:53,380
Go with these men.
They'll help you. Go!

437
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:30,990
- Is he all right?
- Yes.

438
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,350
- You're Mr. Bauer?
- Yes.

439
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:36,680
You did great. Thank you for everything.

440
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,170
I want to see my brother.

441
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:40,520
I know.
We're going to bring him here.

442
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:45,470
But right now, I'd like you to go with Agent Moran,
so he can take your statement, please.

443
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,330
Follow me.

444
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:01,010
- Jack...
- It's all right, it's all right.

445
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:01,790
You need to give yourself a shot.

446
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:04,260
I already did, 20 minutes ago.
It's not working.

447
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:07,520
It's okay. It's okay.

448
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:10,870
We stopped it.

449
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:15,760
You can finally rest.

450
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,670
Can I have a piece of paper?

451
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:47,350
Yeah, sure, you can have all this.

452
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:48,700
What's that?

453
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,550
This is section "A";
it's the only thing I want.

454
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:53,440
I'll give it to you
as soon as I'm done.

455
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:02,140
Excuse me,
do you mind if I sit here?

456
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:04,670
No, of course not.

457
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:09,660
- You heading home?
- Yeah

458
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:10,880
Us too.

459
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,280
We live in Glendale.

460
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,570
Woodland Hills. Oh!

461
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:15,550
My husband's parents live there.

462
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:17,890
You know the Pelusos?

463
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:20,910
I don't think so.

464
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:23,050
You mind doing me a favor?

465
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:24,740
Sure.

466
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:30,490
Do you see the man behind us at a table?
He's wearing a suit.

467
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:32,470
Uh, short, dark hair?

468
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:36,330
Yes. Yes, is he staring over here?

469
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:39,120
No. You know him?

470
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,690
No, it's just that he
was staring at me earlier.

471
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:44,840
Well, you're very pretty.

472
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:50,720
-What?
-No, he's moving away now.

473
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,830
I've got her in sight.
She's waiting at the gate now.

474
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:57,330
They should begin boarding
within the hour.

475
00:30:57,330 --> 00:30:59,240
Okay, look, I know that
the bioweapons threat is over,

476
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:02,330
but I'd feel a lot better if you'd watch
over her until she gets on that plane.

477
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:04,240
Yes, sir, I'll let you know
when she's in the air.

478
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,210
Thanks.

479
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:07,720
I need you to contact the Bureau office.

480
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:10,260
Tell them we need a full interrogation
package ready for when we arrive.

481
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:12,840
- Yes, sir.
- Thanks.

482
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:20,040
Jack?

483
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,070
I just got word.

484
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:23,800
Jonas Hodges was killed with
a car bomb less than an hour ago.

485
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,600
What? How?

486
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,310
We don't have any leads yet,

487
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:31,510
but obviously somehow the people he
was working for found out he was still alive.

488
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:33,130
That means they're going
to be coming after Tony.

489
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:35,720
We need to transport him in a convoy...
full guard detail, weapons ready.

490
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:38,560
We're not losing him again.

491
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:49,590
The FBI located Al-Zarian.
There was nothing we could do.

492
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:53,640
You're telling me the canister is gone.

493
00:31:56,210 --> 00:31:58,250
Damn it!

494
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:03,490
Without that pathogen,
everything that we've worked for is finished.

495
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:06,420
You should also know the FBI has Tony.

496
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:08,090
Then you need
to have him eliminated.

497
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:10,320
- Alan.
- He knows too much, Cara.

498
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:13,290
We can't take the risk that he'll break.
You need to take him out.

499
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:16,490
I'm trying to tell you
that won't be necessary.

500
00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:19,290
Tony won't be in custody for long.

501
00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:21,740
- What are you talking about?
- Trust me.

502
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:25,300
We've got another play.

503
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:28,110
You better have.

504
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:34,060
The incoming flight from Boston
will be arriving shortly.

505
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:37,400
Once the passengers have deplaned and
the maintenance crew is given a chance

506
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:40,500
to clean up the aircraft,
we should be able to begin boarding.

507
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,000
We appreciate your patience.
Thank you.

508
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,970
Well, at least we know the plane's on its way.

509
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:47,770
I'll believe that when I see it.

510
00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:51,400
Well, I'm gonna get some coffee.
Does anybody want anything?

511
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,350
I'll take a decaf.

512
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:54,550
Nothing for me, thanks.

513
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:56,440
Oh, come on.
Are you sure? It's my treat.

514
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,210
No, no, thank you.

515
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,700
Your husband's really nice.

516
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:06,760
Hmm, he has his moments.

517
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:09,910
You know what?
I'm, I'm gonna use the restroom.
Do you mind watching my bag?

518
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:11,780
- Sure.
- Thank you.

519
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,920
Miss Taylor.

520
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:54,360
Agent Pierce.

521
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,640
I know you're upset I went off protocol,

522
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,340
but as I told you, it won't happen again.

523
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:00,060
No, ma'am, it won't...

524
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:03,960
or you'll need to find
someone else to do this job.

525
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,930
Aaron, that won't be necessary.

526
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:10,230
Ma'am, you said you left the
grounds to run a personal errand.

527
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:13,920
May I ask what it was?

528
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:22,370
I just needed to get of here,
be alone, clear my head,

529
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:26,400
if only for a short time.

530
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:31,390
Everything that's happened today...
being held hostage,

531
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:34,870
Jonas Hodges' murder...

532
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:41,360
and seeing my father
so weak and vulnerable...

533
00:35:44,090 --> 00:35:48,330
I was feeling overwhelmed.

534
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:53,130
Aaron, I'm trying to live up
to my mother's expectations.

535
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:56,090
And I didn't want her...

536
00:35:56,090 --> 00:36:01,180
or anyone else for that matter...
to know I was being affected by the pressure.

537
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:06,870
I hope you can understand that.

538
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:11,720
Yes, ma'am, I think I can.

539
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:14,750
You feeling all right now?

540
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:17,220
I am, actually.

541
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:22,160
I guess I just needed to tell
someone what was going on with me.

542
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,390
I'm glad
it was someone I could trust.

543
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:28,750
Well, thank you, ma'am.

544
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:34,000
I'll have those phone and internet records ready
for the Justice Department investigators shortly.

545
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,430
Yes, ma'am.

546
00:36:39,350 --> 00:36:42,320
Thank you, Aaron.

547
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,610
This is Kanin.

548
00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:05,870
Sir, this is Agent Pierce.
I hope I didn't wake you.

549
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:08,470
No, Agent Pierce,
I'm wide awake.

550
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:09,600
What can I do for you?

551
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:12,780
Mr. Kanin, some years ago,

552
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:15,190
while I served on
President Palmer's detail,

553
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:20,110
I was made aware of some modifications
made to the Chief of Staff's office.

554
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:21,780
You mean,
during Mike Novick's tenure.

555
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:27,530
Yes, sir, specifically the installation
of a voice-activated recordinsystem.

556
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:30,130
It allows staff meetings
to be logged and archived.

557
00:37:30,130 --> 00:37:33,270
If you're asking whether I used the
recording equipment, the answer's yes.

558
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:39,120
Sir, did you disconnect it when
you resigned and left your office?

559
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,410
No. Why you asking?

560
00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:43,360
I'd prefer not to
answer that at this time.

561
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:47,490
I need to know how to
access the digital recorder.

562
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:51,580
You can't.
It's secured with biometric lock.
You need my thumbprint.

563
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:54,040
Look, Aaron, if you want my help,

564
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:57,880
you're gonna have to
tell me what this is about.

565
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:01,700
Olivia Taylor's still using my office.

566
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:03,820
Does this have to do with her?

567
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:08,340
I really can't talk about
this over the phone right now.

568
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,810
I'll be at the White House
within a half hour.

569
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:13,300
Thank you, sir.

570
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:45,850
Do you have something
you'd like to say to me?

571
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:47,970
- Like what?
- Oh, I think you know.

572
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:49,220
I don't think I do.

573
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:52,510
How about "Good job, Janice,
on reconstructing the UMPC"?

574
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:56,770
Or "Just maybe I should have considered the
possibility that you actually know what you're doing."

575
00:38:56,770 --> 00:38:58,820
Oh, you don't know me,
but  you did, you would understand

576
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:02,210
that this is the last place you
should look for any type of validation.

577
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:05,640
How about just
acknowledging you were wrong?!

578
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,220
We're almost ready to go.

579
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:13,800
Okay. Is this her?

580
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:20,640
Uh, yes, but when I saw her in the Metro,
she had on this dark wig and a leather jacket.

581
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:24,620
Jibraan, your brother's here.

582
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:27,580
Hamid!

583
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:30,420
- Let's pack up.
- Hamid!

584
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:53,900
Well, the coffee place over here...
excuse me...

585
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:55,160
didn't have decaf,

586
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:59,740
so I had to go all the way to
the other end of the terminal,

587
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:04,600
but I want you to know I got it.

588
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:07,540
Thank you.

589
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,600
This is Bauer.

590
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:30,490
I'm sending a link to your phone.
It's something I think you should see.

591
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:32,550
Who is this?

592
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:35,200
Open the link, Mr. Bauer.

593
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,750
Who the hell is this?

594
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:47,060
Your daughter's in the
company of our operatives.

595
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:49,220
And Agent Franks
has already been neutralized.

596
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:53,410
You will help Tony Almeida escape
or my people will murder your daughter.

597
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:56,880
Any effort to contact her
or warn anybody about this

598
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,010
will have the same result,
you understand?

599
00:40:59,010 --> 00:41:01,040
What you're asking
me to do is impossible.

600
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,670
Tony Almeida's already been secured.
He's under heavy guard.

601
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:05,750
Well, that's your problem.

602
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:08,090
Put this call on your earpiece
and keep the line open.

603
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:10,610
I'm gonna be listening
to everything you say.

604
00:41:10,610 --> 00:41:13,490
Now, Bauer.

605
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:35,910
You're gonna pay
for what you did to Larry.

606
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:42,180
I thought you were going with Moran.

607
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:44,700
Changed my mind.

608
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:48,820
I wanna see this through.

609
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:54,810
You're gonna make your move
to break Almeida out soon.

610
00:41:54,810 --> 00:41:58,400
I'm gonna tell you what
to do and when to do it.

611
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,390
Oh, and Mr. Bauer,

612
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:02,410
if any of those agents in
that van get in the way,

613
00:42:02,410 --> 00:42:06,940
you will have to eliminate them,
or your daughter will die.
