1
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:18,590
Tony, we have a problem. We determined
a man who was exposed to the virus got out.

2
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,358
Son of a bitch! How'd that happen?

3
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:24,718
Got out before we reinforced the perimeter.
Probably didn't know he'd been exposed.

4
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,236
<i>If we don't find this guy before he becomes
symptomatic, we might have an outbreak.</i>

5
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,757
- What do you want?
- To give you your next assignment.

6
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:36,317
There's a man named Ryan Chappelle,
regional director of CTU. I want him killed.

7
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,590
Saunders has proven he will use this virus

8
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,632
to inflict mass casualties
if you don't do what he says.

9
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,553
How long am I supposed
to let him hold this country hostage?

10
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,113
Until we catch him.

11
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:49,391
- Saunders has another demand.
- What does he want now?

12
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,475
He wants you killed.

13
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,718
He's threatened to release the virus into
the population unless we deliver you by 7am.

14
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,239
My God, Jack.

15
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,033
He'll use the virus.
The president had no choice.

16
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,277
Ryan, I think we've found Saunders.

17
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:08,190
<i>45 minutes ago he called from an apartment
near here. Chase is leading a team there now.</i>

18
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,276
<i> Good, Jack.</i>

19
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,393
- No one's here.
- Why are you doing this?

20
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,511
Even if I told you, you wouldn't understand.

21
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:23,269
<i>A van will be arriving shortly.
Leave Chappelle's body with the driver.</i>

22
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,592
I'm sorry, Ryan, we gotta do this.
Get on your knees.

23
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,835
I'm sorry we let you down.

24
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,076
God forgive me.

25
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,397
He's clean. There's no tracker.

26
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,239
If you try to follow us,
Saunders will release the virus.

27
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,756
<i>- Wayne Palmer.
- This is Jack Bauer.</i>

28
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:36,149
Chappelle's body's just been picked up
by Saunders' people.

29
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,236
Thanks, Jack.

30
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,838
Ryan Chappelle is dead.

31
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:13,874
I ordered the death of one of our agents.
One of our finest.

32
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:20,756
As unthinkable as that was, I had to buy
some time in order to protect civilian lives.

33
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:26,235
I will not cave in to any more
of this terrorist's demands.

34
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,949
We're vulnerable as long as Saunders
has this virus and is willing to release it.

35
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:38,276
So far over 700 people have been infected,
and they're all gonna die.

36
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,672
Unless you're willing to accept more loss
of life, I don't know what else we can do.

37
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,513
He has us in a corner, David.

38
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,871
Convene the Cabinet.

39
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,871
Yes, sir.

40
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,272
- What'd you find?
- We worked up the money trails.

41
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,312
Saunders sends $10,000 a month
to his daughter Jane.

42
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,845
- He has a daughter?
- Right here on the screen.

43
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,917
She's 19, lives in Santa Barbara
and goes to school there.

44
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:30,673
Find out where she is now. Call Santa Barbara
PD and make sure they're on standby.

45
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,916
- Almeida.
- Tony, it's Jack.

46
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,589
<i>- Jack, what happened?
- Chappelle's dead.</i>

47
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,877
Saunders' people picked up his body.
Four men, all wearing hoods.

48
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,880
- Black van, no plates.
- I'll see if we can sat-track it.

49
00:05:44,915 --> 00:05:46,871
I already put Adam on it.

50
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,753
Do we have any idea
why Saunders wanted Chappelle dead?

51
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:55,637
I was just about to call you. We found
a thread that Chappelle was working up.

52
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,593
- Looks like Saunders has a daughter.
- A daughter?

53
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,632
The money trail leads to a Jane Saunders.

54
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:06,840
- What do we know about her?
- She's 19, goes to school in Santa Barbara.

55
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,395
- Is she still there?
- I was just about to have her picked up.

56
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,880
Wait. Tony, Tony.
Don't. That's not the right play.

57
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:16,394
- Why not?
- We don't know anything about her.

58
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:21,071
We don't even know if she knows who her
father really is, and Saunders'll protect her.

59
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:25,598
So someone's watching her. If you wanna
grab her, do it without him knowing.

60
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,871
Which means we have to switch her out
with one of our own agents.

61
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,911
I don't know that we have the time.

62
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,873
We're gonna have to find an agent
in the next half-hour.

63
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,836
Saunders is calling all the shots. If we don't
do something, we're gonna be paralyzed.

64
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,845
I'll get started.

65
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,845
Chloe, we need to find
a Jane Saunders lookalike.

66
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,998
Get a description. Cross-reference it
with CTU agents in regions two and three.

67
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,554
- When do you need it?
- Right now.

68
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,071
- I just started the file on her.
- Chloe, just do it for me, please.

69
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:04,677
<i>- Dessler.
- Hey, it's me. Did you get the test results?</i>

70
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,429
I won't know if I'm infected for another hour.

71
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,551
What's taking so long?

72
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:14,878
They couldn't interpret the results here.
They had to send everything back to the lab.

73
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,559
How are you feeling?

74
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,845
I'm... I think I'm OK.

75
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,668
No nose bleeds? Nothing on your skin?

76
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,634
No. NHS has everything under control here.

77
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,115
I wanna keep busy. How can I help?

78
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,869
Adam's working on citywide containment.
I'll have him split off some of his workload.

79
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,873
<i>Open up a socket.
You can help with NHS deployment.</i>

80
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,878
<i>I'll call you later, OK?</i>

81
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,991
Yeah. OK.

82
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:01,515
Michelle's still at the hotel. I told her you'd
send over some of your system updates.

83
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,556
OK. I'll send 'em right over.

84
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,636
Where are we on this guy who escaped?

85
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,149
His name is Bill Cole.
He's an insurance sales rep.

86
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,630
His wife wasn't being very cooperative.

87
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:14,594
We did manage to get from her that Cole
came home unusually late and left early.

88
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,793
- For work?
- His office doesn't open for a half-hour.

89
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,845
We're looking for him now.

90
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:24,077
NHS just arrived.
They'll quarantine the house and test the wife.

91
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,078
- Who are we sending?
- Chase. He'll be there soon.

92
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:33,236
<i>- Agent Bauer, I have the president for you.
- Patch him through.</i>

93
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,913
<i>- Jack.
- Mr President.</i>

94
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:39,113
Stephen Saunders, the man who's in control
of the virus. You know him?

95
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:44,155
I worked with him on a mission that you
sanctioned, the Drazen mission in Kosovo.

96
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,677
The last conversation I had with him,
he said there would be other demands.

97
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,236
His exact words: "The main event to come."

98
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,199
- Any idea what he means?
- I wish I could tell you, sir.

99
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,676
Right now Stephen Saunders
is in a vengeful state of mind.

100
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,315
Any demands that he makes will be
detrimental to American security.

101
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,236
What I'm asking, Jack,
is what will he do if I say no to him?

102
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:11,872
When I worked with Saunders, I never
thought he was capable of mass murder.

103
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:15,236
Today we know he is. He still has the virus.

104
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:20,918
If you don't meet his demands, sir,
I believe that he will continue to release it.

105
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,753
- Thank you, Jack.
- Yes, Mr President.

106
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:35,910
Here's the list you wanted of the top ten
agents that could double as Jane Saunders.

107
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:41,637
- None of these are in Los Angeles.
- The closest is CTU, San Francisco.

108
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,990
Did you put together a second-tier list?

109
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,076
Yeah.

110
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:57,879
- You sure this is right?
- I double-checked when I saw the results.

111
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,874
- Kim Bauer.
- Could you come up to my office, please?

112
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,717
- Sure.
- Thanks.

113
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,195
- You're not gonna use her?
- We don't have a choice.

114
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:23,879
- Shouldn't you talk to Jack first?
- I'll take care of it, all right? Thank you.

115
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,276
Hi.

116
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,872
- Why don't you sit down?
- OK.

117
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:40,800
Kim, we need to question Jane Saunders
without her father knowing about it.

118
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,195
But we're pretty sure
he has somebody watching her.

119
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,033
Fine. What do you need me to do?

120
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,391
You're the same age, similar body types.

121
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:53,315
Your faces are not so different
that we couldn't disguise it from a distance.

122
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,113
You want me to pose as Jane Saunders?

123
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,880
We have better matches,
but they're too far away from this office.

124
00:10:59,915 --> 00:11:03,350
So the bottom line is...
you're our best chance.

125
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:09,078
We don't have much time, we're still in
the early stages of planning this mission,

126
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:14,752
but if all goes according to plan,
it shouldn't be too dangerous.

127
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,712
Now, I'm not gonna order you to do this.

128
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,308
I know, and I know
what's been going on today,

129
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,278
and if you had a better option,
I know you'd take it.

130
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,994
I'm fine and I'll do it.

131
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:31,157
- You sure?
- Positive.

132
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:55,829
Chloe, I'm leaving for Santa Barbara.
Transfer all my stuff onto your system.

133
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,872
- I know. I already pulled your data.
- Good.

134
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:02,515
It's only fair I tell you,
I told Tony I didn't think you should do this.

135
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,349
- Field work isn't learn as you go.
- I'm not doing this to be a field agent.

136
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,756
- There's no one else.
- That's why I didn't fight Tony harder.

137
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:14,829
Not that he would listen to me anyway.
I know he doesn't respect my opinions.

138
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,555
- OK, look, I have to go.
- I just wanted to let you know how I felt.

139
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:23,158
I want you to know that I'm behind you 110%.
I really hope nothing bad happens to you.

140
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,835
Chloe, are you coordinating
this operation from inside?

141
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,845
- Of course.
- You should start prepping.

142
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,952
I bet there's two dozen agents
still waiting for comm codes.

143
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:35,038
I like your energy, Kim. Use it.

144
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:40,035
Adam, could you send me a list of personnel
on the Jane Saunders operation?

145
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,958
- I can't. I'm monitoring Chase.
- Did he find Bill Cole?

146
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:47,875
- Not yet. He's interrogating Cole's wife.
- This thing is out of control.

147
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,392
<i>- I said on the phone that Bill isn't here.
-  I know.</i>

148
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,955
But when he was here, did you notice
anything out of the ordinary?

149
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,845
- Was he bleeding from the nose?
- Not that I saw.

150
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:04,237
- What about rashes, skin irritation?
- No. Why would you think that he'd be sick?

151
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:08,148
He came in contact with some people
who were sick at the Chandler Plaza Hotel.

152
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:12,831
- When was he at the Chandler Plaza?
- Earlier this morning.

153
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:18,318
No, he wasn't.
He was with a client at the office.

154
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,677
He did it again, didn't he?

155
00:13:24,712 --> 00:13:27,474
The bastard did it again.

156
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,160
- Ma'am...
- Then...

157
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:35,111
I hope he did get something.
I hope that he dies.

158
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:38,869
- Please, Mrs Cole, I need you...
- Get out of my way!

159
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,354
- Get out of my way!
- Mrs Cole!

160
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,438
You need to stay calm
because I can't let you leave.

161
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,028
- Agent Edmunds.
- Yeah.

162
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,594
One of my men just found this.

163
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,230
- Where?
- Waste basket in the bathroom.

164
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,433
- Blood's tacky, which means it's fresh.
- Then Bill Cole's symptomatic.

165
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:03,590
I need you to contact every ER
and urgent-care facility in a 30-mile radius.

166
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:10,430
Excuse me. I've had a nose bleed
for an hour. I can't seem to stop it.

167
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,516
- Did you put ice on it?
- Yeah.

168
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:15,871
- Try an ER. Get it cauterized.
- I gotta go to work.

169
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,480
We don't have anything here that'll stop that.

170
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,989
All right. Thanks.

171
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,076
Excuse me.

172
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,676
The swap'll take place at the library.
She works there in the mornings.

173
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:31,873
- This is a file of relevant personal data.
- All right.

174
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,710
- Chloe, where's Tony?
- In the teleconference room with Kim.

175
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,075
Why isn't she working the satellite track?

176
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:44,118
You might wanna ask Tony about that.

177
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:50,199
Once you get into position, just act naturally.
Try not to look out of place.

178
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,356
- Jack.
- What are you doing with Kim?

179
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:56,040
Chloe came up with matches
for Jane Saunders.

180
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:00,193
- Good, so we've got one.
- You're not gonna like it.

181
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,117
It's Kim.

182
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,990
- My Kim?
- I'm not crazy about it, either.

183
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:11,556
But she's the only one that matched
physically and geographically.

184
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,910
- You're sending her out?
- She can handle it.

185
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,600
- Plus she has a safety net.
- Find someone else.

186
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,678
We need to get Saunders' daughter
without him knowing.

187
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,678
- Kim's our best shot at doing that.
- She's not doing it.

188
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,911
It's not up to you. It's her decision.

189
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:30,235
Fine. I'll order her not to do it.

190
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,112
Jack...

191
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:37,590
She doesn't work for you, Jack!
She works for me!

192
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,876
Don't.

193
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,758
- Dad, please don't do this.
- Get out of here.

194
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,633
Get out of here now,
or I'll throw you out myself! Move!

195
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,716
Jack!

196
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:58,629
Talk it over with your father.
If we have to abort this, I wanna know now.

197
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,716
I'll be outside.

198
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:07,348
- This is not going to happen!
- Somebody has to do it!

199
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,675
- Someone will. Not you!
- I'm the best match!

200
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:13,315
- You're not a field operative!
- I have weapons training.

201
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:19,669
- Saunders' people won't even come close.
- Kim, it's not a chance I'm willing to take!

202
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:23,514
You're not taking it! I am!

203
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:29,158
The reason why I gave you this job
is so that I could make sure you'd be safe!

204
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:34,472
I took this job because I wanted it.

205
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,670
Not because you wanted me here.

206
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:43,750
I know that this is hard for you.

207
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,798
But this is not your decision.

208
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:50,230
This is my job. Better yet, my duty.

209
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,595
I'm gonna be safe.

210
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:00,115
But I'm doing it.

211
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,512
- They ready to go?
- All set.

212
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,279
When we get there,
they'll do your hair and make-up.

213
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:40,428
We'll set you in a position where Saunders'
people can only view you from a distance.

214
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,835
- Are you getting a clear signal?
- It's fine.

215
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,598
- Kim.
- Yeah?

216
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:50,352
This is a gun I got for you. I don't think you'll
have to use it, but if you do, don't hesitate.

217
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,835
- OK.
- Come on. Let's go.

218
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,635
Please be seated.

219
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,189
Thank you for assembling on short notice.

220
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:39,472
You've already been briefed on the Cordilla
virus that is now threatening our cities.

221
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,434
What you don't know is
we have two new developments.

222
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,475
Wayne.

223
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,797
First, a vial of that virus
has already been released.

224
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:51,759
The Chandler Plaza Hotel here in Los Angeles
was the site of the first attack.

225
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,474
That situation is being addressed.

226
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,516
We have the identity of the perpetrator.

227
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,473
His name is Stephen Saunders
and he's a former Ml6 agent.

228
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,398
Apparently, Mr Saunders
has at least 11 more vials

229
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:05,592
and is threatening to release them
unless we meet his demands.

230
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:09,156
<i>- What are those demands?
- So far there have been two.</i>

231
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:15,276
One was for the president to use the phrase,
"The sky is falling" in a press conference.

232
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,834
He then demanded
we terminate one of our agents.

233
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:21,839
<i>- One of our agents? Why?
- We're still looking into that.</i>

234
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:25,839
<i>What was his response
when you didn't comply?</i>

235
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,877
It devastates me to tell you
that I had no choice but to comply.

236
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:39,154
A half-hour ago we delivered this agent's
body to one of Saunders' representatives.

237
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,673
<i>My God.</i>

238
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,871
Millions of lives are at stake.

239
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:49,880
I need each of your departments
to open your files to CTU, Los Angeles.

240
00:19:49,915 --> 00:19:52,872
Give them whatever they need.

241
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,880
I'm trying to get into some DOD files.
I need authorization from Chappelle.

242
00:20:03,915 --> 00:20:07,316
- When's he gonna be back?
- He's not.

243
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,635
What do you mean?

244
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:17,793
Could I have everybody's attention, please?

245
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,871
I'm sorry to have to tell you that...

246
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:31,194
Ryan Chappelle was killed
in the line of duty about a half an hour ago.

247
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:37,845
I can't give you any more details...

248
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:41,190
but I'll be assuming Ryan's responsibilities

249
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:45,319
until we hear from
Brad Hammond at Division.

250
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:51,872
There'll be an opportunity to pay proper
respects to Ryan, but now's not the time.

251
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:55,236
- Tony, it's Chase on line five.
- Thanks.

252
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,189
- Almeida.
- It's me. I'm at Cole's house.

253
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:06,233
We found evidence
he's almost certainly symptomatic.

254
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,669
How many people
did he come in contact with?

255
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,398
Just his wife.
NHS is moving her into isolation.

256
00:21:11,433 --> 00:21:13,996
- I'll let the teams know.
- Transfer me to Kim.

257
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,790
- She was running a simulation for me.
- I gave that to Adam.

258
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:21,880
- Kim's out on assignment right now.
- What kind of assignment?

259
00:21:21,915 --> 00:21:24,314
<i>Saunders has his daughter
under surveillance,</i>

260
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,880
<i>so Kim's gonna take her place
when we grab her.</i>

261
00:21:26,915 --> 00:21:29,474
What the hell is she doing out there?

262
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,751
I don't wanna hear about it.
Kim was the only match we had.

263
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,314
There's gotta be other agents
you can use for this.

264
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,398
No, there aren't! Back off, Chase!

265
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,996
Where is she now?

266
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,754
She's on her way to Santa Barbara with Jack.

267
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,758
<i>- Jack signed off on this?
- First of all, it's my call.</i>

268
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:53,432
Secondly, yes, Jack did. But, most
importantly, Kim accepted the assignment.

269
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:56,870
<i>I'm gonna transfer you over to Adam.</i>

270
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,678
Fine.

271
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:11,712
I'm sorry about what happened earlier.
I didn't mean to scare you.

272
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:15,628
I just don't think what you're doing is right.

273
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,876
But I need you to understand something.
In the field I am in command.

274
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,515
You do what I tell you to do.
Do you understand me?

275
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,880
- Do you understand me?
- Yes.

276
00:22:25,915 --> 00:22:27,871
OK, good.

277
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:34,034
<i>... attempted to reach hotel officials,
the police, even the FBI.</i>

278
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,711
My nose has been bleeding
for almost an hour. I can't get it to stop.

279
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:43,037
- Have a seat and fill this out.
- How long will that take?

280
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,914
There are a couple of patients ahead of you.
Not too long.

281
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:48,031
Thanks.

282
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:54,845
<i>... contracted some illness. As to how
serious this illness is, we have no information.</i>

283
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:59,880
<i>We cannot verify this, but we are hearing that
whatever is infecting the people of this hotel,</i>

284
00:22:59,915 --> 00:23:02,633
<i>it is very serious and possibly deadly.</i>

285
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:06,992
<i>Body bags have been spotted and rescue
workers are around the Chandler Plaza.</i>

286
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,759
<i>Authorities are not giving any information...</i>

287
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,472
- Hey!
- One minute, sir.

288
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:15,657
No, now! I need to see a doctor now!
I was at that hotel.

289
00:23:15,692 --> 00:23:19,715
- There is something wrong with me.
- Oh, my God. You're him.

290
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:25,915
Hold on. Dr Joyner. The man
we're supposed to isolate, he's here.

291
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,833
- Yes?
- We've just ID'd the body.

292
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,871
- And it's Chappelle?
- It's confirmed.

293
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,872
The thumb print matched the one in his file.

294
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,832
Good. Dump the body.

295
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,869
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

296
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,753
Did you take care of your problem?

297
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:03,879
Yes. Chappelle's dead. But CTU's still gonna
try to find out what he was working up.

298
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,520
So tell Lennox to stay alert.

299
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,189
Make sure he doesn't let Jane out of his sight.

300
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:13,634
<i>- Yeah?
- Any problems over there?</i>

301
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:17,439
No. She's leaving her apartment now.
She's going to work.

302
00:24:17,474 --> 00:24:20,999
All right. Stay with her.
The next few hours are crucial.

303
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,076
I'll be here.

304
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:43,469
Mr President, we've started down
a slippery slope here, and unless we're...

305
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:47,633
Cut the euphemisms, Joseph.
What are you trying to say?

306
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:51,673
We're concerned about the fact that
you ordered the death of a high-ranking...

307
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:55,156
We're not here to second-guess
actions that have already been taken.

308
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:59,871
No one's more aware than I am
of the moral ambiguity of my decision.

309
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,845
I did it to buy CTU more time
to find Saunders

310
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,793
and to delay for as long as possible
the slaughter of millions.

311
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,555
I made the decision to protect their future.

312
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:15,031
<i>Not mine.</i>

313
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,870
Saunders.

314
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,875
I have to take this.

315
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,635
Yes.

316
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,194
I've confirmed the identity
of Chappelle's body.

317
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:37,159
It will be disposed of respectfully.

318
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,845
We know who you are, Mr Saunders.

319
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:42,110
Whatever you want to accomplish,
you'll fail.

320
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,199
Your only chance is to relinquish the virus
and hope we don't find you.

321
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,880
That's not going to happen.

322
00:25:48,915 --> 00:25:50,871
What is it you want?

323
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,878
To make America clean again.

324
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:58,869
You see, Mr President, the world
hates America, and for good reason.

325
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,876
I won't bother going into the details.

326
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,880
You know better than I
the atrocities your nation commits.

327
00:26:04,915 --> 00:26:06,950
But we're gonna change all that.

328
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:10,072
You and I, together, are going to dismantle

329
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,749
the military machine that exports
its ugliness across the globe.

330
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:18,112
- And how are "we" going to do that?
- We'll start where the work gets dirtiest.

331
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,845
Something I know a little about.
Covert foreign nationals.

332
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:28,193
In 32 countries your government employs
grade A through H intelligence consultants.

333
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,714
They are citizens of their countries.

334
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,638
They're spies working against those countries

335
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,274
at the behest of
the American military machine.

336
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:41,833
<i>In 45 minutes I want a list of their identities
sent to me by way of a website:</i>

337
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:44,997
sylviaimports.com.

338
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:50,797
If you fail to comply, I will release
two vials of the virus in major cities.

339
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:56,159
And this time, they won't be in hotels
where they can be contained.

340
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:34,758
- Agent Bauer. Rachel Forrester.
- Agent Kim Bauer.

341
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:39,317
- She's gonna double for Jane Saunders.
- We're set up a staging area by the library.

342
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,874
- Is it a safe distance away?
- We won't be detected.

343
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,835
- Is she there yet?
- She will be in a few minutes. Let's go.

344
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,235
Make sure nobody leaves their house.

345
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:10,871
Sheriff's department is sending officers.
Until they get here, use your men.

346
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,845
<i>Excuse me.</i>

347
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,791
- Edmunds.
- We found Bill Cole.

348
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:18,189
- Where?
- An urgent-care center not far from you.

349
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,845
- Laurel Canyon and Moorpark.
- I know it.

350
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:25,431
Get over there and get as much as you can
off of Cole. He's pretty agitated.

351
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,149
Tony, is Kim in play yet?

352
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:32,875
- She just landed at Santa Barbara.
- I'll call you.

353
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:46,476
- Where's Jane now?
- In the library, behind the reference desk.

354
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,279
- How crowded?
- 10, 20 people.

355
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:52,188
One belongs to Saunders, and their orders
are not to let her out of their sight.

356
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:56,359
We've taken over the surveillance cameras
and narrowed it down to five probables.

357
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,517
Get that intel over to Tony Almeida at CTU.

358
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,877
OK, let's see her.

359
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,912
You're not gonna fool anyone
who knows Jane up close.

360
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:09,874
- I know.
- Stay at least 10 feet behind the counter.

361
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:13,157
I want you to keep your head down
as much as possible.

362
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,270
The wig looks darker than Jane's hair.

363
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,436
It's the best we could do at short notice.

364
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:28,557
You're gonna have to match every detail
as closely as possible. Her life depends on it.

365
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:47,154
<i>Mr Cole, when you were inside the store,
who did you come in contact with?</i>

366
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,880
- What do you mean, contact?
- Who did you talk to?

367
00:29:49,915 --> 00:29:52,235
Just the pharmacist behind the counter.

368
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,920
How many others? Customers?

369
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:58,396
Yeah, there were some other people there.

370
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:01,273
How many other people were there?

371
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:07,880
Bill, if we do not identify and track down
everyone you have come in contact with,

372
00:30:07,915 --> 00:30:12,635
we are gonna have a citywide epidemic,
so how many people?

373
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:17,079
I don't know.

374
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,396
Think!

375
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,870
<i> That's it.
We're now patched in to campus security.</i>

376
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,556
<i> We're all up.</i>

377
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,955
Nothing on B.

378
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,389
<i> Go ahead. Try six.</i>

379
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:53,991
On your screen, go ahead
and isolate the front desk.

380
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,554
<i>-  Five is good.
- Top screen set.</i>

381
00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:00,880
- No.
- That's all we can get from it?

382
00:31:00,915 --> 00:31:02,598
Let's see if we can activate it.

383
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,315
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

384
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,276
Hi, Jane.

385
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,471
- I am so sorry.
- You're not supposed to have drinks in here.

386
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:31,354
- I'm sorry. I'll throw it away.
- It's OK.

387
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:50,388
Start tracking that man in the red shirt.
I wanna know everything that he does.

388
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,750
Got subject on camera four right now.

389
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,754
I was just about to replace those.
Here you go.

390
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,555
There you go. Clear.

391
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,994
- No activity.
- What camera are you on?

392
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:39,317
- The main screen.
- What the hell is taking her so long?

393
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,396
Checking all screens now.

394
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,954
- Where's subject?
- Nothing on one.

395
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:46,190
- Come on.
- Nothing on two.

396
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,470
- Still on four?
- Negative.

397
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,989
She's coming out on four.

398
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:23,158
Kim, there's a man heading
from the bookcase at your three o'clock.

399
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:30,078
<i>Red shirt. He might be one of Saunders'men.
I want you to angle away from him slowly.</i>

400
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,753
- Good.
- We still have subject Red Shirt on camera.

401
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,429
We just got off the phone with Chase,
who's with Cole right now.

402
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:41,757
After Cole left the hotel,
he went to his house in Burbank.

403
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:45,111
He stopped at a gas station
on Riverside Drive, self-service.

404
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:50,360
His wife confirmed he didn't become
symptomatic until after he got home.

405
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,431
- The nose bleeds and sweating?
- Right.

406
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,676
Here's where the ripple effect starts.

407
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,791
At 7.20 he stopped at a pharmacy

408
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,475
and asked the pharmacist, Sam Tyler,
for medication to stop the bleeding.

409
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:03,273
There were three other people
inside that pharmacy.

410
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:07,951
Anne Schwartz has been going to the
pharmacy for years, so they had her address.

411
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:12,079
We've sent NHS people to her house.
She has a husband and three children.

412
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,430
- And the other two customers?
- IDs unknown.

413
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:18,673
They could be anywhere, spreading the
disease to anybody they're in contact with.

414
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:24,392
It gets worse. At the urgent-care facility
there were six patients when Cole came in

415
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:28,195
who left before the quarantine
was put in place.

416
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:32,233
We're tracking them down,
but between them and the staff at the facility,

417
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:35,557
we could be looking at up to 75 people
just in their families.

418
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:40,834
If any of these people are in a supermarket
or a mall when they become symptomatic,

419
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:43,110
it's gonna be impossible to contain.

420
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,760
We need to identify 'em and find them now.

421
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:48,752
Coordinate with NHS and Hazmat.

422
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:53,590
We have to set up a quarantine in two
neighborhoods in the Studio City area.

423
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:56,678
Department heads report to Adam.

424
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,880
If Wally has time,
have him get on the exterior cams.

425
00:35:13,915 --> 00:35:17,077
Good work, everybody.
It looks like this worked.

426
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:21,876
Maintain monitoring
and come get me if anything happens.

427
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:25,035
Thank you. Good work.

428
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,870
What's going on?

429
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:00,839
- Who are you?
- My name is Jack Bauer.

430
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:04,270
I'm a federal agent.
You're not in any danger.

431
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:07,636
What do you want?

432
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:11,309
We need your help.
We need to get in touch with your father.

433
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:15,829
- What do you need me for?
- We don't know where he is.

434
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:18,519
And we think you do.

435
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,158
What's this about?

436
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:25,636
You don't know who your father really is.

437
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:30,798
First of all, I hardly know my father,
and whatever this is, I know it's illegal.

438
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:34,793
You have no right to keep me here. Release
me now. I haven't done anything wrong.

439
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,845
Listen to me very carefully, Jane.

440
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:40,668
Your father is engaged in terrorist activity
against the United States.

441
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:44,509
He's killed hundreds of people
and has threatened to kill thousands more.

442
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:47,910
I can only imagine how difficult
this must be for you to believe,

443
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,231
but you're going to cooperate with us.

444
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:53,636
There's a lot at stake
and there's not a lot of time.

445
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,880
I'm not gonna do anything.
I wanna talk to a lawyer.

446
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:03,269
There's no lawyer. There's just you and me.

447
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,712
I don't know anything about my father.

448
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:18,276
He comes into town twice a year.
I don't even know where he lives.

449
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:22,359
- How do you contact him?
- I don't. He calls me.

450
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,869
- You're lying to me, Jane.
- I'm not.

451
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:32,876
Don't try protecting him.
You'll get in trouble.

452
00:37:32,911 --> 00:37:35,792
You're the one in trouble.
You're breaking the law!

453
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,871
You think I'm playing a game here with you?

454
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,760
Hundreds of thousands of lives
are on the line.

455
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:44,230
You have no idea how far I'm willing to go
to acquire your cooperation.

456
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,635
- What are you threatening?
- Where is he?

457
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:49,911
I don't know! Please somebody help me!

458
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:54,880
- Where is your father?
- Jack. Red Shirt is approaching the desk.

459
00:37:54,915 --> 00:37:56,871
Please.

460
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,436
- What's going on?
- He's at the desk.

461
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,845
Kim, don't turn around.
Just stay where you are.

462
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:09,590
- Where the hell's the librarian?
- Get someone to the reference desk now.

463
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:15,879
- Excuse me.
- Just a minute.

464
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:20,795
- I need some help with finding a book.
- Just one second.

465
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:24,031
You're doing great.
Just stay calm until we check this guy out.

466
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,476
Give me a close-up of the gentlemen.

467
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:31,310
- Can I get some help here?
- I'll be with you in a minute.

468
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:45,590
OK, Kim, I want you to slowly get up and try
and make your way to the bookshelves.

469
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:52,788
<i>Stay out of his eye line
until we find out who this guy is.</i>

470
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,950
Maintain a constant visual on her.

471
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:26,835
- Get camera three on Kim.
- Coming over to camera three.

472
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:38,069
- Get me another angle.
- There is no other angle.

473
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:42,951
- What's going on?
- Camera three should pan back on her.

474
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,950
- You work here, don't you?
- Yeah.

475
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:58,710
- Could you help me find something?
- Yeah. What is it that you need?

476
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:01,877
Call for help and I'll kill you right now.

477
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,845
- What?
- Who has Jane Saunders?

478
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:08,873
- Who has Jane Saunders?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

479
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,520
Let's go. Come on.

480
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:17,036
Back in range in three seconds.

481
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,594
Where the hell is she? Kim?

482
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:22,518
- Dammit!
- Team two! Go! Go!

483
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,877
Get down! Get down!

484
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,597
Kim!

485
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:19,479
Kim, step back. Step back!

486
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:24,678
Radio back. Tell them subject is down.

487
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,876
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

488
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:32,869
Saunders is gonna know
we have his daughter.
