1
00:00:12,853 --> 00:00:18,132
Right now, terrorists are plotting
to assassinate a presidential candidate.

2
00:00:18,213 --> 00:00:20,681
My wife and daughter have been targeted.

3
00:00:20,773 --> 00:00:24,846
And people that I work with
may be involved in both.

4
00:00:24,933 --> 00:00:30,929
I'm Federal Agent Jack Bauer,
and today is the longest day of my life.

5
00:00:35,413 --> 00:00:38,291
Rick, it's me.
The safe house has been attacked.

6
00:00:38,373 --> 00:00:42,446
The agents that were looking after us
are dead, and my mother is gone.

7
00:00:42,533 --> 00:00:44,524
- What?
- I'm coming to your place.

8
00:00:44,813 --> 00:00:47,850
- I never met anyone that has amnesia before.
- Mrs. Bauer?

9
00:00:48,293 --> 00:00:51,729
- You know me?
- Of course. Will Dr Parslow be joining you?

10
00:00:51,813 --> 00:00:54,122
- You don't remember me?
- Are you my doctor?

11
00:00:54,213 --> 00:00:56,602
We're gonna figure out what this is about.

12
00:00:56,693 --> 00:01:00,322
There is some physical evidence
in George Ferragamo's office

13
00:01:00,413 --> 00:01:04,326
- that leads directly to you.
- So I'll be framed for his murder?

14
00:01:04,733 --> 00:01:08,806
It's me. Palmer is staying
in Los Angeles after all.

15
00:01:08,893 --> 00:01:13,045
- The Nash girl called you?
- Yes. I'm on my way to the hotel now.

16
00:01:13,693 --> 00:01:17,368
We will keep it simple. We want you
to plant a tracking device on him.

17
00:01:17,453 --> 00:01:21,765
SWAT team stand down. Clear the floor.
Alexis is in the room.

18
00:01:22,213 --> 00:01:25,330
What's that in her hand?
Oh, my God, she's got a knife!

19
00:01:25,693 --> 00:01:29,163
- Son of a bitch!
- SWAT team, hit the room now!

20
00:01:31,653 --> 00:01:34,121
Nina! We cannot let him die!

21
00:01:34,493 --> 00:01:37,371
It's Alexis's phone. What do we do?

22
00:01:37,453 --> 00:01:39,444
We gotta take a chance.

23
00:01:40,293 --> 00:01:41,851
- Do you have the money?
- Yeah.

24
00:01:41,933 --> 00:01:44,128
OK. We'll meet in 45 minutes.

25
00:01:59,253 --> 00:02:01,562
Listen up, people. Listen up!

26
00:02:01,653 --> 00:02:05,726
Alexis Drazen was leaving for a meeting.
At this meeting he was gonna make a payoff.

27
00:02:05,813 --> 00:02:10,489
So somewhere in this room there is money.
I want it found and I want it found now.

28
00:02:10,573 --> 00:02:13,770
- Elizabeth can't be held responsible for this.
- I don't disagree.

29
00:02:13,853 --> 00:02:17,209
But we have a tape of her plunging
a letter opener into a man's stomach.

30
00:02:17,293 --> 00:02:19,523
- You got her into this.
- No, sir, I did not.

31
00:02:19,613 --> 00:02:22,286
I did not ask her to stab Alexis Drazen.

32
00:02:22,373 --> 00:02:28,448
I misjudged her ability to handle the stress
of this, and as I said, I will do all I can to help.

33
00:02:30,613 --> 00:02:33,127
I know you're just trying to protect me.

34
00:02:33,213 --> 00:02:37,092
Senator, I understand
the situation that you're in.

35
00:02:37,173 --> 00:02:41,405
But I do not need to remind you that
there are at least two suspects at large.

36
00:02:41,493 --> 00:02:45,406
Sir, please, I implore you. Have as much
security around you as you can tolerate,

37
00:02:45,493 --> 00:02:47,563
and let us do our job.

38
00:02:51,653 --> 00:02:54,406
- Keep me posted.
- Yes, sir. I promise I will.

39
00:02:58,093 --> 00:03:00,926
They need to bag all this as evidence.

40
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:09,088
- OK. All this needs to be included.
- 15 minutes, team. Gotta be ready to go.

41
00:03:11,013 --> 00:03:13,925
- Bingo.
- Found it!

42
00:03:14,013 --> 00:03:17,483
- What?
- Bearer bonds.

43
00:03:18,693 --> 00:03:22,208
As good as cash and easier to move.
Got the address of the restaurant yet?

44
00:03:22,293 --> 00:03:25,922
- California Plaza. It's 20 minutes from here.
- Good.

45
00:03:26,013 --> 00:03:28,925
How are you gonna pull this off?
Pretending to be Alexis?

46
00:03:29,013 --> 00:03:31,288
I don't know yet. Hey, Jake.

47
00:03:31,893 --> 00:03:34,361
Jake, come here. Give me your shirt.

48
00:03:34,453 --> 00:03:38,082
- I'm going with you. Coordinate your backup.
- Fine.

49
00:03:46,453 --> 00:03:49,365
- What's the update on Bauer's family?
- Still missing.

50
00:03:49,453 --> 00:03:51,683
Anything back from forensics yet?

51
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:56,324
Based on preliminary reports, it looks like
the agents were killed protecting the women.

52
00:03:56,413 --> 00:04:00,122
We have to find the wife and daughter.
I alerted a task force over at District.

53
00:04:00,213 --> 00:04:02,852
Call and see if they need
anything else from our end.

54
00:04:02,933 --> 00:04:05,367
- All right.
- Tony?

55
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:09,128
Still no word to Jack on any of this,
understand?

56
00:04:09,213 --> 00:04:12,523
What do you want me to tell him
if he calls and asks?

57
00:04:12,613 --> 00:04:17,448
Tell him you're workin' on somethin' else
and put him through to me, all right?

58
00:04:29,933 --> 00:04:31,571
What are you lookin' for?

59
00:04:31,653 --> 00:04:35,202
Whoever Dan was working for
might have information about my mom.

60
00:04:35,293 --> 00:04:38,763
This guy who was in charge - Gaines?
I'd never met him before. Dan knew him.

61
00:04:38,853 --> 00:04:41,208
- Maybe his number's here.
- What are you gonna do?

62
00:04:41,293 --> 00:04:43,284
Call him and ask for your mom back?

63
00:04:43,373 --> 00:04:46,285
Any information I find,
I'm gonna give it to the police.

64
00:04:47,573 --> 00:04:51,691
You hear that, Rick? She's gonna
call the police. Is that OK with you?

65
00:04:51,773 --> 00:04:56,847
- I thought you said you don't trust the police.
- Whatever. I'll give it to my dad.

66
00:04:58,053 --> 00:05:03,047
Dan'll go ballistic when he finds out
you guys have been going through his stuff.

67
00:05:06,053 --> 00:05:10,490
- You didn't tell her Dan's dead?
- Not yet. I don't wanna freak her out.

68
00:05:10,573 --> 00:05:15,203
Besides, Dan's brother Frank is on his way
here and I don't want him to know.

69
00:05:16,213 --> 00:05:20,365
- Don't say anything, OK?
- OK.

70
00:05:23,733 --> 00:05:28,204
This is such a waste of time.
We're never gonna find anything.

71
00:05:28,293 --> 00:05:30,284
I don't even know why I came.

72
00:05:37,133 --> 00:05:41,012
You're married.
You have a daughter named Kimberly.

73
00:05:41,093 --> 00:05:43,084
- I have a daughter?
- Yes.

74
00:05:44,013 --> 00:05:46,004
A teenage daughter.

75
00:05:47,653 --> 00:05:52,204
You and Jack, you were separated
about six months ago. That's when we met.

76
00:05:55,733 --> 00:05:58,406
- Who are you?
- I'm a friend.

77
00:05:59,413 --> 00:06:01,404
A very good friend...

78
00:06:02,373 --> 00:06:06,082
- who wanted to be a lot more.
- But...

79
00:06:06,173 --> 00:06:09,882
You were afraid to start a relationship,
so we didn't.

80
00:06:09,973 --> 00:06:12,965
Then you decided
to go back with your husband.

81
00:06:13,813 --> 00:06:16,850
Maybe it was because of Kimberly.
I don't know.

82
00:06:17,253 --> 00:06:20,211
But you asked me not to call, and I haven't.

83
00:06:23,573 --> 00:06:26,610
I... I don't remember any of this.

84
00:06:27,613 --> 00:06:30,730
We need to get you to a hospital,
have you looked at.

85
00:06:30,813 --> 00:06:36,012
- Why? You said you were a doctor.
- I'm a surgeon. You need a neurologist.

86
00:06:36,093 --> 00:06:39,290
- You've suffered some trauma.
- I don't wanna go to a hospital.

87
00:06:39,373 --> 00:06:42,206
- Why not?
- I don't know. I just don't want to.

88
00:06:44,013 --> 00:06:46,607
What if I examined you here?

89
00:06:48,893 --> 00:06:50,884
OK.

90
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:58,928
There is some physical evidence
in George Ferragamo's office

91
00:06:59,013 --> 00:07:01,049
that leads directly to you.

92
00:07:01,693 --> 00:07:05,083
Subtle enough so the fire marshals
didn't find it the first time.

93
00:07:05,173 --> 00:07:07,607
But with a little help, they'll find it.

94
00:07:09,933 --> 00:07:14,609
- So I'll be framed for his murder?
- Like I said, whatever it takes.

95
00:07:20,093 --> 00:07:22,084
I don't know what you think you got.

96
00:07:22,173 --> 00:07:27,725
What we've got is a tape of Carl Webb
admitting that he set my son up for murder.

97
00:07:29,173 --> 00:07:31,164
It's a while since I've practised law,

98
00:07:31,253 --> 00:07:34,404
but I know that unless
Keith was sanctioned by a court order

99
00:07:34,493 --> 00:07:37,690
and prepped by an authority,
this is not evidence.

100
00:07:37,773 --> 00:07:41,686
I've been in politics long enough to know
that if the media gets hold of this tape,

101
00:07:41,773 --> 00:07:43,764
the truth will come out.

102
00:07:43,853 --> 00:07:48,529
No. Today can't be about two things, David.

103
00:07:48,613 --> 00:07:52,526
It's either about winning the primary,
securing the party nomination,

104
00:07:52,613 --> 00:07:57,084
or it's about a political scandal,
but it can't be about both.

105
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:11,009
- Destroy the tape.
- What?

106
00:08:11,293 --> 00:08:14,729
If you don't, not only
will you bring down yourself,

107
00:08:14,813 --> 00:08:17,008
but you'll bring the entire party down.

108
00:08:17,093 --> 00:08:19,846
- How do I do that?
- Because you're gonna win today.

109
00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:22,652
You'll have enough delegates
by eight o'clock.

110
00:08:22,733 --> 00:08:27,443
You are the Democratic Party's candidate
for president, whether you like it or not.

111
00:08:27,533 --> 00:08:33,085
And if you decide to self-destruct, it will take
years for the party's platform to recover.

112
00:08:33,173 --> 00:08:37,803
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Why don't we
let the electorate decide on that?

113
00:08:37,893 --> 00:08:41,363
And I don't consider
telling the truth self-destructive.

114
00:08:41,453 --> 00:08:44,490
And how bad will it be for the Democrats

115
00:08:44,573 --> 00:08:48,930
if somebody else comes out with this first
and I have to go on the defensive?

116
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:54,801
What do you think, Mike?

117
00:08:55,693 --> 00:08:58,412
I've seen much uglier stories
kept under wraps.

118
00:09:01,573 --> 00:09:06,363
The only people who know about this tape
are the people in this room and Keith.

119
00:09:08,013 --> 00:09:10,481
This would not be a difficult item to shelve.

120
00:09:11,773 --> 00:09:14,048
And besides, this is currency.

121
00:09:15,253 --> 00:09:18,404
Once you get into the White House,
this could protect you.

122
00:09:18,493 --> 00:09:20,768
- How?
- Well, think about it.

123
00:09:21,773 --> 00:09:26,528
You'll have evidence against some of
the most powerful men in the country.

124
00:09:31,213 --> 00:09:34,046
They won't be able to control you, David.

125
00:09:44,733 --> 00:09:47,850
- Tony, it's Jack. How's everything going?
- Fine.

126
00:09:47,933 --> 00:09:50,572
I need to speak to Mason.
He's not in his office.

127
00:09:50,653 --> 00:09:53,121
- He's on the floor. Let me transfer you.
- OK. Wait.

128
00:09:53,213 --> 00:09:56,125
Before you do, have you spoken to Teri yet?

129
00:09:57,893 --> 00:10:00,088
- No.
- Give me the number of the safe house.

130
00:10:00,173 --> 00:10:03,848
- I'll call over there myself.
- Look, let me see if I can get that for you.

131
00:10:03,933 --> 00:10:05,924
Hang on a second.

132
00:10:09,013 --> 00:10:11,288
- What's up?
- Jack's on the phone. He wants you.

133
00:10:11,373 --> 00:10:13,967
- OK.
- And he wants the number of the safe house.

134
00:10:14,053 --> 00:10:16,442
- Of course he does.
- Look...

135
00:10:17,893 --> 00:10:21,522
- Why not tell him what happened?
- Why is this so difficult to comprehend?

136
00:10:21,613 --> 00:10:25,572
The man is neck-deep in an investigation.
He has a job to do. Let's let him do it.

137
00:10:25,653 --> 00:10:30,647
We get him to a controlled environment, we
can tell him. Meanwhile, we have a job to do.

138
00:10:30,733 --> 00:10:33,293
I gotta say, I just think it's wrong.

139
00:10:33,373 --> 00:10:39,164
It's not about right and wrong. It's about the
fact that we have a priority to protect Palmer.

140
00:10:39,253 --> 00:10:41,130
He's on line two.

141
00:10:41,213 --> 00:10:43,966
- Jack, it's me. Where are you?
- We're on our way to a meet.

142
00:10:44,053 --> 00:10:47,090
- What kind of meet?
- Alexis was supposed to make a payoff.

143
00:10:47,173 --> 00:10:49,482
- A payoff to who?
- I'm not sure yet.

144
00:10:49,573 --> 00:10:52,246
- So what are you gonna do?
- Pretend to be Alexis.

145
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:54,767
Oh, Jack, you're never gonna pull that off.

146
00:10:54,853 --> 00:10:57,970
Alexis was supposed
to pay this guy $50,000 in bearer bonds.

147
00:10:58,053 --> 00:11:01,523
George, you're gonna have to work
with me on this. I need backup.

148
00:11:01,613 --> 00:11:05,003
Milo's got the address.
We should be there in about 15 minutes.

149
00:11:05,733 --> 00:11:09,169
You keep this guy in play, we got
a chance of bringing these guys down.

150
00:11:09,253 --> 00:11:13,485
Otherwise you can wait for Alexis to come to,
if he comes to. By then this could be over.

151
00:11:13,573 --> 00:11:17,009
- All right. I'll go along. I'll send you a team.
- Thank you.

152
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:20,688
Can you pass me to Tony? He was gonna
give me the number for the safe house.

153
00:11:20,773 --> 00:11:24,561
Yeah. I just spoke to Paulson over there.
He said the girls were sleeping.

154
00:11:24,653 --> 00:11:28,282
OK. Um, get them to call me back
on my cell when they wake up.

155
00:11:28,373 --> 00:11:30,284
- Definitely.
- Thank you.

156
00:11:30,373 --> 00:11:32,762
- Mason's on board.
- Oh, that's good.

157
00:11:53,853 --> 00:11:57,607
- So what else did Teri say?
- She didn't say much.

158
00:11:58,293 --> 00:12:02,366
Once she guessed that you'd been seeing me,
she didn't wanna talk to me.

159
00:12:02,453 --> 00:12:05,684
Not that I blame her.
But I couldn't finish the debrief.

160
00:12:05,773 --> 00:12:08,765
I left and let Paulson do it.
Maybe that was a mistake.

161
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:12,368
No. You did the right thing.
This is my fault. I should have told her.

162
00:12:12,453 --> 00:12:16,890
- Sounds like she didn't wanna talk about it.
- Doesn't matter. I still should have told her.

163
00:12:16,973 --> 00:12:21,967
Jack, from what I could see,
she really loves you and wants to work it out.

164
00:12:23,733 --> 00:12:28,284
- Maybe you wanna call and see how she is.
- I tried. Mason said they were sleeping.

165
00:12:31,413 --> 00:12:35,247
You know, why don't you call Paulson
and see if they're up yet?

166
00:12:39,893 --> 00:12:42,532
- It's not going through.
- It might be the area.

167
00:12:42,613 --> 00:12:44,922
Try again when we get to the plaza.

168
00:12:45,693 --> 00:12:48,048
Look, I'm really sorry about all this.

169
00:12:48,133 --> 00:12:50,124
Yeah, me too.

170
00:12:54,293 --> 00:12:56,284
Hanlin? No.

171
00:12:56,973 --> 00:13:01,842
Come on, guys. Do what you can.
At least try to find somebody else, huh?

172
00:13:02,253 --> 00:13:04,244
Yeah.

173
00:13:04,933 --> 00:13:08,608
- Yeah?
- I need extra bodies to help track the Bauers.

174
00:13:08,693 --> 00:13:11,810
I don't know. I don't see anyone
doing crossword puzzles here.

175
00:13:11,893 --> 00:13:14,851
Look, uh, my hands are
a little tied without Nina here.

176
00:13:14,933 --> 00:13:16,924
Cos Nina's with Jack, right?

177
00:13:18,373 --> 00:13:20,364
Yeah.

178
00:13:21,733 --> 00:13:25,248
She says it's over between them.
What do you think?

179
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:27,893
- What?
- No, I'm just asking.

180
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:30,726
You gotta be wondering yourself, right?

181
00:13:31,973 --> 00:13:34,407
Hey, Almeida. I'm on your side.

182
00:13:35,213 --> 00:13:38,205
Nina oughta be here right now.
What does Jack need her for?

183
00:13:38,293 --> 00:13:42,764
You bust your ass with no resources because
she's with him. If that works for you, great.

184
00:13:42,853 --> 00:13:46,243
You know what works for me? You keeping
out of my personal business. OK?

185
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:50,167
Know what? There's entirely too much
personal business going on around here.

186
00:13:50,253 --> 00:13:52,483
I wanna get this place back on track.

187
00:13:52,573 --> 00:13:57,363
- It seems Nina is a big part of the problem.
- How do you figure that?

188
00:13:57,453 --> 00:14:02,129
She covers for everyone that doesn't
follow code. And they cover for her.

189
00:14:02,813 --> 00:14:05,088
She's with Jack. She's with you.

190
00:14:05,173 --> 00:14:08,688
You don't think that's relevant?
You don't think that's a distraction?

191
00:14:08,773 --> 00:14:12,482
- No, I don't.
- No, you don't. Well, I do.

192
00:14:29,653 --> 00:14:33,726
- Patty said you wanted to talk to me, Dad.
- Yeah. Sit down. Close the door.

193
00:14:37,573 --> 00:14:39,689
What's up?

194
00:14:39,773 --> 00:14:44,528
Before I make my decision about giving
this tape to the DA, I wanted to talk to you.

195
00:14:44,613 --> 00:14:46,126
OK.

196
00:14:46,213 --> 00:14:49,603
I wanted you to understand
what you're up against.

197
00:14:49,693 --> 00:14:53,003
- I understand, Dad. I'm ready to go.
- No, no, no.

198
00:14:53,093 --> 00:14:55,084
Listen to me.

199
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:57,844
We're going to the press with a story

200
00:14:57,933 --> 00:15:02,131
about some bad men committing murder
and trying to frame you.

201
00:15:02,213 --> 00:15:04,852
But these men are going
to shift the attention to you

202
00:15:04,933 --> 00:15:08,005
and your involvement
with Lyle Gibson's death.

203
00:15:08,093 --> 00:15:10,926
Ultimately,
they're gonna make this about you.

204
00:15:11,013 --> 00:15:14,005
On television, in the press,
everywhere you go.

205
00:15:15,573 --> 00:15:19,452
You're gonna be accused
of a crime you did not commit.

206
00:15:19,533 --> 00:15:21,888
- Can you live through that?
- Yes, I can.

207
00:15:21,973 --> 00:15:24,851
Don't just say it.

208
00:15:24,933 --> 00:15:27,288
Think about it.

209
00:15:28,893 --> 00:15:31,361
Dad...

210
00:15:31,453 --> 00:15:34,604
What do you think I've been living through?

211
00:15:34,693 --> 00:15:37,332
Not just today, but for years?

212
00:15:39,933 --> 00:15:42,686
I made a mistake.

213
00:15:42,773 --> 00:15:46,971
I was wrong to go to Mom and Carl.
I should have come forward right away.

214
00:15:48,093 --> 00:15:50,812
Taken my hits right then and there.

215
00:15:51,773 --> 00:15:54,082
But I was scared.

216
00:15:54,173 --> 00:15:56,164
That's what you learn.

217
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:59,528
It's OK to be scared.

218
00:16:07,213 --> 00:16:09,602
What I said last night...

219
00:16:10,173 --> 00:16:12,164
About you not being there.

220
00:16:14,013 --> 00:16:16,004
It's not true.

221
00:16:18,893 --> 00:16:21,088
It's, uh...

222
00:16:21,173 --> 00:16:25,212
what I told myself
so I can blame you for my screwup.

223
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:32,123
It doesn't matter why you said it.
The fact is, there's some truth to it.

224
00:16:33,093 --> 00:16:35,482
I haven't always been there.

225
00:16:39,933 --> 00:16:42,242
But I'm here now.

226
00:16:52,973 --> 00:16:54,326
- Jovan?
- Yes, Andre?

227
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:56,768
I can't find Alexis. Have you heard from him?

228
00:16:56,853 --> 00:16:58,969
- No.
- He's meeting Morgan in 20 minutes.

229
00:16:59,053 --> 00:17:01,362
- I need to talk to him.
- I don't know, Andre.

230
00:17:01,453 --> 00:17:05,002
- I've got my own situation to deal with.
- Still no sign of the women?

231
00:17:05,093 --> 00:17:07,766
- I'll find them.
- You checked the hospitals?

232
00:17:07,853 --> 00:17:11,892
I checked everywhere. I don't need
you looking over my shoulder!

233
00:17:11,973 --> 00:17:15,045
I'll find them and kill them.
Don't worry about it.

234
00:17:15,133 --> 00:17:19,570
Calm down, and don't tell me not to worry.
Just tell me how you plan to find them.

235
00:17:21,733 --> 00:17:26,284
I'm going to the Bauer house.
Eventually, someone will show.

236
00:17:36,173 --> 00:17:38,243
- Aunt Ethel isn't there.
- Anyone else?

237
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:41,803
I've tried everyone I can think of.
No one's heard from my mom.

238
00:17:41,893 --> 00:17:45,772
- Rick. We got things to do. She's gotta go.
- What kind of things?

239
00:17:45,853 --> 00:17:50,529
- You'll find out when Frank gets here.
- What's that supposed to mean?

240
00:17:52,133 --> 00:17:55,170
- Kim's in trouble. I gotta help her.
- We'll be in trouble too.

241
00:17:55,253 --> 00:17:58,211
- Look, she has to leave.
- OK. That's fine.

242
00:17:58,293 --> 00:18:00,409
Kim, wait. Wait.

243
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:04,562
Hey, look. I just need to talk to her
for a second, then she'll go.

244
00:18:09,373 --> 00:18:10,601
Where are you gonna go?

245
00:18:10,693 --> 00:18:13,924
There's a park my mom said to go
in an emergency, like an earthquake.

246
00:18:14,013 --> 00:18:17,005
- Maybe she's there.
- Why don't you just go to your house?

247
00:18:17,093 --> 00:18:19,402
The people that are after us
must know where I live.

248
00:18:19,493 --> 00:18:23,168
- If she's safe, she's not gonna go there.
- This park. How will you get there?

249
00:18:23,253 --> 00:18:25,687
I don't know. Um...

250
00:18:25,773 --> 00:18:28,685
Can I borrow your car?

251
00:18:28,773 --> 00:18:31,845
It's not mine, it's Melanie's.

252
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:35,604
Wait a minute.

253
00:18:44,413 --> 00:18:49,089
Here. Take this. You can usually catch a cab
on Fourth. It's a couple of blocks this way.

254
00:18:49,173 --> 00:18:52,210
- Sure you can't come with me?
- After last night, I gotta lay low.

255
00:18:52,293 --> 00:18:55,205
They're gonna be looking for me.

256
00:18:55,293 --> 00:18:58,126
I still think you should turn yourself in.

257
00:18:58,213 --> 00:19:01,125
It's not that bad. You helped us escape.

258
00:19:01,213 --> 00:19:04,250
I'm on probation.
They catch me, I'm going to prison.

259
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:07,245
It doesn't matter what you or your folks say.

260
00:19:08,653 --> 00:19:11,372
I wish we would have met before this.

261
00:19:13,013 --> 00:19:15,208
So do I.

262
00:19:20,093 --> 00:19:22,527
Are you gonna be OK?

263
00:19:22,613 --> 00:19:24,683
Yeah.

264
00:19:25,973 --> 00:19:28,931
I wouldn't be alive if it wasn't for you.

265
00:19:29,013 --> 00:19:31,402
You wouldn't be in trouble if it wasn't for me.

266
00:19:31,493 --> 00:19:34,166
That's not true.

267
00:19:34,653 --> 00:19:36,769
Dan would have found someone else.

268
00:19:48,533 --> 00:19:50,171
- Hey, Rick.
- Hey.

269
00:19:51,693 --> 00:19:54,491
- So, how'd it go last night?
- It went fine.

270
00:19:54,573 --> 00:19:56,131
Yeah?

271
00:19:57,333 --> 00:20:01,042
- Don't look fine. What happened to you?
- Nothin'. I'm OK.

272
00:20:01,293 --> 00:20:04,569
Hey, Dan! Dan!

273
00:20:04,973 --> 00:20:08,329
- Go. Get outta here. Grab a cab on Fourth.
- I know.

274
00:20:09,133 --> 00:20:11,124
- Where's my brother?
- He's out.

275
00:20:11,213 --> 00:20:13,204
- Out where?
- We got separated.

276
00:20:14,293 --> 00:20:16,523
- Uh-huh. So where's the money?
- He's got it.

277
00:20:16,613 --> 00:20:18,365
Uh-huh.

278
00:20:18,853 --> 00:20:20,969
- I should get going.
- Where are you going?

279
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,044
- What do you mean?
- I don't know you.

280
00:20:23,133 --> 00:20:25,328
- My name's Kim.
- Hi, Kim. How do you know Rick?

281
00:20:25,413 --> 00:20:28,052
She's a friend from San Diego.
She's gotta get home.

282
00:20:28,133 --> 00:20:30,601
- She's not going anywhere.
- What's that mean?

283
00:20:30,693 --> 00:20:33,651
My brother's not here,
nor is my money, and I don't know her.

284
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:36,964
- She's a friend.
- I got business going down in half an hour.

285
00:20:37,053 --> 00:20:40,489
Until Dan gets back with the money,
nobody leaves.

286
00:21:00,973 --> 00:21:05,205
OK, the teams will be in
hidden positions here, here, here and here.

287
00:21:05,293 --> 00:21:07,932
- Communications?
- On the same channel as us.

288
00:21:08,013 --> 00:21:10,004
- Exits?
- They'll be covered by the teams,

289
00:21:10,093 --> 00:21:12,323
but I'll add one here at the widest exit.

290
00:21:12,413 --> 00:21:14,404
OK, good.

291
00:21:16,773 --> 00:21:19,241
- Yeah?
- Jack, you all set up?

292
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:24,123
- Yeah. The team's in place?
- Yeah. That's what I wanted to call you about.

293
00:21:24,213 --> 00:21:26,363
- Teddy Hanlin's running backup.
- What?

294
00:21:26,453 --> 00:21:29,809
Don't freak out. I'm sure it'll be fine.
Just avoid a confrontation.

295
00:21:29,893 --> 00:21:33,681
- Dammit. How could you let this happen?
- I'm sorry. I just found out about it.

296
00:21:33,773 --> 00:21:37,686
- Division made the assignment.
- I understand. Fine, I'll deal with it.

297
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:39,612
- I don't believe this.
- What?

298
00:21:39,693 --> 00:21:43,322
- Teddy Hanlin's in charge of backup.
- Seth Campbell's old partner?

299
00:21:43,413 --> 00:21:46,610
- Yeah.
- Great. Who are you calling?

300
00:21:46,693 --> 00:21:52,529
The safe house. I wanna make sure Teri
and Kim are all right before this gets started.

301
00:21:52,613 --> 00:21:56,128
- No one's picking up. Is this number right?
- It's the one Paulson gave me.

302
00:21:56,213 --> 00:21:59,410
- Why can't I get through?
- Jack.

303
00:22:00,013 --> 00:22:03,164
Hey, Jack. Haven't seen you
since you put my partner away.

304
00:22:03,253 --> 00:22:07,451
- Teddy, don't start.
- Teddy, is your team in place?

305
00:22:07,533 --> 00:22:11,685
Yeah. We're not up here shopping for
Dockers. I heard you really screwed up today.

306
00:22:11,773 --> 00:22:16,608
I guess some people have connections and
don't get spanked when they break the law.

307
00:22:16,693 --> 00:22:19,890
The guy we're looking for
is wearing a red cap. That's all we know.

308
00:22:19,973 --> 00:22:22,168
I'll stay visible, hopefully draw him to me.

309
00:22:22,253 --> 00:22:25,131
No one makes a move
until I give the word. Is that clear?

310
00:22:25,213 --> 00:22:28,011
It's your show.
Just make sure you stay put when you do.

311
00:22:28,093 --> 00:22:30,812
I always get a bit nervous
about target confusion,

312
00:22:30,893 --> 00:22:34,124
and I'd hate to see one of
the good guys go down by mistake.

313
00:22:34,213 --> 00:22:36,204
Teddy. Let's get started, OK?

314
00:22:37,413 --> 00:22:40,485
Hey. I don't want a problem on this.

315
00:22:48,973 --> 00:22:52,488
Hey. I got a call from the Rampart Division.

316
00:22:52,573 --> 00:22:56,771
A woman matching Teri Bauer's description
was seen wandering around Griffith Park.

317
00:22:56,853 --> 00:22:59,890
- You know, it's not far from the safe house.
- Where is she?

318
00:22:59,973 --> 00:23:04,285
- She disappeared.
- All right. I'll get on the satellite uplink.

319
00:23:04,733 --> 00:23:06,849
- Post someone at the Bauer house.
- I did.

320
00:23:06,933 --> 00:23:10,448
- Williams should be there in a few minutes.
- Good work.

321
00:23:18,133 --> 00:23:22,206
I don't like what I'm seeing. Looks like
you've been roughed up by someone.

322
00:23:23,173 --> 00:23:27,052
Do you think maybe that I hit my head,
that that's why I can't remember?

323
00:23:27,133 --> 00:23:30,409
That's just it.
There's no evidence of a head injury.

324
00:23:31,853 --> 00:23:37,803
Except for the memory loss, you're coherent.
Beside the bruises, do you have any pain?

325
00:23:37,893 --> 00:23:39,804
Yeah.

326
00:23:39,893 --> 00:23:42,771
Something's been bothering me, sort of here.

327
00:23:50,093 --> 00:23:53,483
Oh, my God. What...
What do you think happened to me?

328
00:23:53,573 --> 00:23:55,564
I don't know.

329
00:23:56,573 --> 00:24:00,532
But I... I think you have a condition.
It's called dissociative amnesia.

330
00:24:00,613 --> 00:24:04,845
It can happen to someone when
they suffer an intense emotional trauma.

331
00:24:04,933 --> 00:24:08,369
We need to get you to a hospital
so they can figure out what's going on.

332
00:24:08,453 --> 00:24:13,527
No, I... I don't wanna do that. I...
I can't explain it, but for some reason I just...

333
00:24:13,613 --> 00:24:18,164
I don't wanna go to a hospital. I just have
this gut feeling that it would be dangerous.

334
00:24:18,253 --> 00:24:22,769
How could it be dangerous? I'd be with you.
I'd be by your side the entire time.

335
00:24:22,853 --> 00:24:25,083
- Come on. It'll be fine.
- No. I don't wanna go.

336
00:24:25,173 --> 00:24:27,846
Teri, we can't stay here.
You need to get checked out.

337
00:24:27,933 --> 00:24:31,323
Neural damage can become permanent
if it's not treated right away.

338
00:24:31,413 --> 00:24:33,290
- No, I don't wanna go.
- Come on.

339
00:24:33,373 --> 00:24:35,045
I don't wanna go.

340
00:24:40,613 --> 00:24:44,322
I don't wanna go to the hospital.
Please don't make me go. I can't do it.

341
00:24:44,413 --> 00:24:47,166
I'm sorry, but I can't.
I don't wanna go to the hospital.

342
00:24:47,253 --> 00:24:49,050
- OK.
- I can't go.

343
00:24:49,133 --> 00:24:51,089
OK.

344
00:24:55,013 --> 00:24:57,891
- Please, Phil. Just take me home.
- OK.

345
00:24:57,973 --> 00:25:00,328
It's OK. It's all right.

346
00:25:00,413 --> 00:25:02,449
Right. I heard.

347
00:25:02,533 --> 00:25:07,129
No. No, we did much better in New York
than we thought. Oh, yeah, definitely.

348
00:25:07,213 --> 00:25:09,204
Put this in my safe now.

349
00:25:09,293 --> 00:25:12,091
Oh, yeah. That'll make him very happy.

350
00:25:13,253 --> 00:25:16,962
Oh, I think so, too.
Oh, DNC, they'll really milk it.

351
00:25:17,853 --> 00:25:19,730
Uh-huh.

352
00:25:19,813 --> 00:25:21,883
Yeah.

353
00:25:21,973 --> 00:25:24,567
Well, I... I'm not sure, but...

354
00:25:25,493 --> 00:25:28,565
Well, that's good, though.
No, I spoke to Chris.

355
00:25:28,653 --> 00:25:32,328
I told him we'd be in Baltimore
if we won New York. Mm-hm.

356
00:25:32,413 --> 00:25:34,483
Right.

357
00:25:34,573 --> 00:25:36,370
Mm-hm.

358
00:25:36,453 --> 00:25:38,648
Yeah. Jerry?

359
00:25:38,733 --> 00:25:43,124
Jerry, listen. I gotta run.
We'll touch base in a couple of hours, OK?

360
00:25:44,173 --> 00:25:46,368
Well, how are Beth and the girls?

361
00:25:46,453 --> 00:25:48,887
That's terrific. All righty. Bye-bye.

362
00:25:48,973 --> 00:25:52,010
Uh, Patty. Do you know where David went?

363
00:25:52,093 --> 00:25:55,972
Just to the conference room. He and Mike
are meeting the publicist for tonight.

364
00:25:56,053 --> 00:25:59,443
- Did he say how long he'd be?
- Um... he didn't say.

365
00:25:59,533 --> 00:26:01,888
Shouldn't be about more than 15, 20 minutes.

366
00:26:01,973 --> 00:26:06,683
- OK. Hm. Hey, did you hear about New York?
- Oh, yeah. Isn't it great?

367
00:26:32,533 --> 00:26:35,570
- Oh. There you are. Jerry's on the line...
- I'm busy.

368
00:26:35,653 --> 00:26:38,247
- He said he just wanted to...
- Well, I'm busy, Patty.

369
00:26:38,333 --> 00:26:41,052
- Tell him I'll call him back.
- OK.

370
00:27:19,693 --> 00:27:21,684
Oh, come on, Dan.

371
00:27:29,413 --> 00:27:31,404
- Where's Keith?
- I don't know.

372
00:27:32,213 --> 00:27:36,650
- I heard, uh, you two had a talk.
- Yes, we did.

373
00:27:38,373 --> 00:27:41,809
- You should talk to him too.
- Really? About what?

374
00:27:42,573 --> 00:27:47,169
Well, we're putting him in a tough place.
He's gonna need both our support.

375
00:27:47,613 --> 00:27:52,004
No, David. You're the one
who's put him in a tough place.

376
00:27:53,253 --> 00:27:57,804
And as for needing us,
our... our baby left the nest a long time ago.

377
00:27:57,893 --> 00:28:00,726
I don't think he cares
to hear what I have to say.

378
00:28:00,813 --> 00:28:03,805
That's ridiculous. Speak to him, Sherry.

379
00:28:29,773 --> 00:28:32,412
I destroyed it.

380
00:28:35,293 --> 00:28:38,046
- You destroyed the tape?
- Mm-hm.

381
00:28:44,293 --> 00:28:47,683
And I know you're gonna be angry,
but it had to be done.

382
00:28:49,733 --> 00:28:53,442
You have blinders on.
You're not seeing this thing very clearly.

383
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:03,564
It's for the best.

384
00:29:18,293 --> 00:29:20,284
It breaks my heart

385
00:29:21,693 --> 00:29:23,684
that I was right.

386
00:29:25,293 --> 00:29:28,444
Right about what, David?

387
00:29:35,773 --> 00:29:38,128
That wasn't the real tape, Sherry.

388
00:29:44,293 --> 00:29:47,888
I've learned that I don't know you
as well as I thought I did.

389
00:29:51,253 --> 00:29:54,245
I had to see just how far
you were willing to go.

390
00:29:58,733 --> 00:30:03,170
I will do anything

391
00:30:03,253 --> 00:30:05,369
to protect my family, David.

392
00:30:08,013 --> 00:30:10,004
Anything.

393
00:30:12,413 --> 00:30:15,610
Does that make me a bad person?

394
00:30:25,293 --> 00:30:27,488
- Set up a press conference.
- When?

395
00:30:27,573 --> 00:30:30,770
- Now.
- We've got one in less than three hours.

396
00:30:30,853 --> 00:30:34,368
- I want this one within the hour.
- Where?

397
00:30:34,453 --> 00:30:39,652
Downstairs. I don't want anyone or anything
to interfere with what I have to say.

398
00:31:04,173 --> 00:31:08,485
- Nina, I'm on channel one. Do you copy?
- Yeah, I hear you, Jack. The signal's good.

399
00:31:08,573 --> 00:31:12,407
- Where are you posted?
- Under the east entrance, under the bridge.

400
00:31:13,333 --> 00:31:16,245
Good. How about you, Teddy?

401
00:31:17,013 --> 00:31:19,766
My teams are in position.

402
00:31:20,933 --> 00:31:22,924
OK. I got you.

403
00:31:29,373 --> 00:31:32,729
You're blocking my view, Jack.
Take a couple of steps back.

404
00:31:34,933 --> 00:31:38,289
- How's that?
- There you go.

405
00:31:38,373 --> 00:31:40,409
Perfect shot.

406
00:31:40,493 --> 00:31:42,563
OK.

407
00:31:45,893 --> 00:31:49,203
- There you go, ma'am.
- Oh, thank you.

408
00:31:49,293 --> 00:31:52,808
You're a very sensitive guy, Jack.
I've never seen that side of you.

409
00:31:52,893 --> 00:31:55,327
Drop it, Teddy. We're working.

410
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:58,610
Jack can walk and chew gum
at the same time, can't you, Jack?

411
00:31:58,693 --> 00:32:01,685
- What do you want?
- Nothin'. It's just that we're both so busy.

412
00:32:01,773 --> 00:32:04,162
We never really get a chance to talk.

413
00:32:05,333 --> 00:32:08,211
Did you hear about
Seth Campbell's wife, Judy?

414
00:32:08,293 --> 00:32:11,808
- No, what about her?
- She hung herself.

415
00:32:12,453 --> 00:32:14,967
Yeah. Happened a couple of weeks ago.

416
00:32:15,053 --> 00:32:17,283
I guess you didn't get the memo, huh?

417
00:32:17,373 --> 00:32:20,490
It was a real tragedy.
She didn't even bother leavin' a note.

418
00:32:20,573 --> 00:32:22,723
I guess she thought it was kinda obvious.

419
00:32:22,813 --> 00:32:27,204
Tryin' to raise four kids with
a husband in prison and no pension.

420
00:32:27,293 --> 00:32:32,321
Cos why, Jack? You busted him for
linin' his pocket with a few extra dollars.

421
00:32:33,053 --> 00:32:37,205
Look, I'm sorry about Judy and I'm sorry
about his kids, but this is not the time.

422
00:32:37,293 --> 00:32:39,284
That's right. You're busy.

423
00:32:41,013 --> 00:32:43,925
- Can this wait, Teddy?
- Uh, of course.

424
00:32:44,413 --> 00:32:48,964
I just thought it'd be nice, you know,
to catch up, while we're hangin'.

425
00:32:49,053 --> 00:32:51,487
Teddy, I understand why you're upset.

426
00:32:51,573 --> 00:32:56,488
As soon as this is over, I'll be happy to sit
down and tell you my side of the story.

427
00:32:56,573 --> 00:33:00,043
I'd really like to hear
your side of the story, Jack.

428
00:33:00,133 --> 00:33:03,728
Tell you what, why don't we go to
a Starbucks, get a couple of cappuccinos,

429
00:33:03,813 --> 00:33:06,088
and we can have a little chinwag?

430
00:33:12,533 --> 00:33:15,252
- CTU, Mason.
- George, we have a problem.

431
00:33:15,333 --> 00:33:17,688
- What?
- Teddy's on the channel hassling Jack.

432
00:33:17,773 --> 00:33:20,287
He's got a rifle,
and it's crawling with people here.

433
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:22,682
It's too late. This is going down any minute.

434
00:33:22,773 --> 00:33:25,333
- We have to do something.
- What channel are you on?

435
00:33:25,413 --> 00:33:27,563
- Channel one.
- All right. Hang on.

436
00:33:32,813 --> 00:33:35,407
- Yeah?
- Tony, conference me in on channel one.

437
00:33:35,493 --> 00:33:37,484
Uh, sure.

438
00:33:41,373 --> 00:33:44,092
Hanlin, it's Mason.
What the hell's the matter with you?

439
00:33:44,173 --> 00:33:47,961
You got a problem with Jack, bury it.
You realise how many agents we lost today?

440
00:33:48,053 --> 00:33:50,806
You're in an uncontained
environment over there.

441
00:33:50,893 --> 00:33:53,407
- So let's get on the same page now, huh?
- Yes, sir.

442
00:33:53,493 --> 00:33:55,961
- Jack, you OK?
- Yeah.

443
00:33:56,053 --> 00:33:58,044
OK. Let's get back to work.

444
00:34:24,093 --> 00:34:27,051
Hello? Yeah, man, it's cool.
He'll be here.

445
00:35:03,253 --> 00:35:06,165
CTU, this is Williams.
I've arrived at the Bauer house.

446
00:35:06,253 --> 00:35:08,244
I'm checking the perimeter.

447
00:35:50,093 --> 00:35:53,005
- Is this my neighbourhood?
- Not quite.

448
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:55,684
We'll be there soon.

449
00:35:58,333 --> 00:36:00,801
Rick says he and Dan got separated.

450
00:36:00,893 --> 00:36:04,169
He'll be here soon.
He knows we need the cash by seven.

451
00:36:09,453 --> 00:36:12,365
- What happens when Dan doesn't show up?
- I don't know.

452
00:36:12,453 --> 00:36:15,684
- I'm not gonna tell him his brother's dead.
- Why? You didn't do it.

453
00:36:15,773 --> 00:36:18,492
- He's gonna find out.
- Not from me.

454
00:36:19,813 --> 00:36:21,804
What?

455
00:36:22,493 --> 00:36:25,963
- I don't understand.
- Neither do I. Doing this deal is suicide.

456
00:36:26,053 --> 00:36:29,682
I'm not talking about the deal.
I'm talking about you.

457
00:36:29,773 --> 00:36:32,287
- What do you mean?
- You have so much going for you.

458
00:36:32,373 --> 00:36:36,685
You're smart, you're good-looking,
you're funny. How did you end up like this?

459
00:36:36,773 --> 00:36:40,163
- I'm doing all right.
- All right? You're wanted by the police.

460
00:36:40,253 --> 00:36:44,087
You got shot in the arm. Your friends
that you hang out with are criminals.

461
00:36:44,173 --> 00:36:49,327
- Do you really wanna end up here?
- I do the best I can. I didn't grow up like you.

462
00:36:49,413 --> 00:36:51,927
That's just an excuse.

463
00:36:52,013 --> 00:36:55,767
I have a friend named Todd.
He went through two foster homes.

464
00:36:55,853 --> 00:36:58,162
He's got a scholarship to Stanford now.

465
00:36:58,253 --> 00:37:01,609
- Good for Todd. Why not go to his house?
- He can't help me find my mom.

466
00:37:01,693 --> 00:37:03,684
Neither can I.

467
00:37:05,893 --> 00:37:09,568
I know you're right. And if I get the chance,
I'll try to turn myself around.

468
00:37:09,653 --> 00:37:12,963
But right now this thing is what it is,
and we've gotta get through it.

469
00:37:13,053 --> 00:37:17,205
Get through this? This is crazy. You can't let
Frank make a drug deal without any money.

470
00:37:17,293 --> 00:37:20,444
We won't get through this.
We'll get stuck in the middle of it.

471
00:37:20,533 --> 00:37:24,003
- You have to talk to him, Rick.
- Hey, stud. Think fast.

472
00:37:24,093 --> 00:37:27,722
Thanks. So, what deal?

473
00:37:30,853 --> 00:37:34,448
We're gonna take the 20 grand
you made last night and buy some ecstasy.

474
00:37:34,533 --> 00:37:36,364
- Dan didn't tell you?
- No.

475
00:37:36,453 --> 00:37:41,004
I'm gonna flip it to these guys in Redondo.
They'll pay 50 for it.

476
00:37:41,373 --> 00:37:46,527
- What happens if Dan doesn't show up?
- Hey, if Dan says he'll be here, he'll be here.

477
00:38:04,093 --> 00:38:06,561
Someone get these kids out of here.

478
00:38:06,653 --> 00:38:09,486
- Station one, that's you.
- Roger. I'm on it.

479
00:38:40,373 --> 00:38:42,568
Hold up. I think I got him.

480
00:39:03,093 --> 00:39:05,084
Hey.

481
00:39:22,573 --> 00:39:24,609
- Alexis?
- Yeah.

482
00:39:25,893 --> 00:39:28,930
- I told you inside the restaurant.
- We're doing it out here.

483
00:39:29,013 --> 00:39:31,652
- Why?
- Because there's a cop inside the restaurant.

484
00:39:31,733 --> 00:39:34,531
Come on, let's get this over with.

485
00:39:36,333 --> 00:39:38,688
Fine.

486
00:39:38,773 --> 00:39:42,209
- Where's the money?
- First let's go over it again.

487
00:39:42,293 --> 00:39:45,842
- Over what?
- What you're supposed to do for me.

488
00:39:47,053 --> 00:39:50,807
At 7.20 tonight I'm gonna shut down
the power on grid 26 double G.

489
00:39:50,893 --> 00:39:53,123
Five minutes later, it comes back up.

490
00:39:55,373 --> 00:39:57,648
- What else?
- What do you mean, what else?

491
00:40:02,373 --> 00:40:04,409
What happened to your accent?

492
00:40:06,413 --> 00:40:08,563
- You're not Alexis.
- He's moving.

493
00:40:09,333 --> 00:40:12,086
Station two, what do you see?

494
00:40:17,693 --> 00:40:19,684
I got him.

495
00:40:21,613 --> 00:40:25,003
- I can take him.
- No! He's not a threat. I can get him.

496
00:40:25,093 --> 00:40:27,368
Hold your fire.
He's going for the east bridge.

497
00:40:27,453 --> 00:40:29,921
- Just cover the exits.
- I'll just slow him down.

498
00:40:30,013 --> 00:40:32,971
- Don't shoot.
- I'm gonna put him down.

499
00:40:33,053 --> 00:40:36,489
- No. I repeat, do not shoot. Nobody shoot.
- Relax, Jack.

500
00:40:36,573 --> 00:40:38,882
- I'll just wing him.
- Do not shoot.

501
00:40:40,253 --> 00:40:41,811
Teddy, stand down!

502
00:40:43,293 --> 00:40:45,284
No!

503
00:40:48,493 --> 00:40:51,291
Stay back! Stay back!

504
00:40:51,373 --> 00:40:53,443
Get me a medic down here now!

505
00:40:53,533 --> 00:40:56,127
Hanlin, you son of a bitch, I said don't shoot!

506
00:40:57,093 --> 00:40:59,084
Take care of this.

507
00:41:00,133 --> 00:41:02,044
Stay back!

508
00:41:02,133 --> 00:41:07,048
Suspect down. I repeat, suspect is down.
I need EMTs at the east end of the plaza.

509
00:41:13,093 --> 00:41:15,084
This is your house.
