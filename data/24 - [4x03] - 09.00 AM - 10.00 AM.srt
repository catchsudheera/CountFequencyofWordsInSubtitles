1
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,111
- Who's this?
- My name is Jack Bauer.

2
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:21,149
I work for Secretary of Defense Heller.
He was kidnapped less than half an hour ago.

3
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,232
<i>I believe the same people</i>
<i>that kidnapped him are chasing you now. </i>

4
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,834
The safest thing for you to do
is let me bring you in.

5
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,437
- I found out who stumbled onto our server.
- Is he with you now?

6
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:33,717
- <i>No. I'll have him shortly. </i>
- Find out who he's talked to.

7
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:38,032
- Who are you?
- I'll kill you if you don't follow my orders.

8
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:43,195
This is a simple task, Behrooz. But these
are the ones where mistakes can be made.

9
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,829
- Debbie, what are you doing here?
- I followed you.

10
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,715
Omar saw you with someone
outside the compound.

11
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,155
She didn't see anything. I made sure of it.

12
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:58,028
We've spent years planning for this,
waiting for this day to come.

13
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:01,237
Now it's here
and you've compromised everything.

14
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:04,757
It's a simple job.
You pick up the subject and bring him in.

15
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,308
Bauer has not been in the field
for a year and a half.

16
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,914
Which is why I need you
to keep him on a tight leash.

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,549
For the record, I think Driscoll
made a mistake letting you come.

18
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,639
You get the gate. I'll get the kid out of the car.

19
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,713
My father is the secretary of defense.

20
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:36,237
Richard, you are the only witness
to your father and your sister's kidnapping.

21
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,518
We need your help.
You don't have anything to hide, do you?

22
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,152
We'll be fine. We're still on US soil.
- What are they gonna do?

23
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:49,313
I don't know, but if they wanted me dead,
they would have killed me at Richard's house.

24
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:53,518
<i> Our soldiers have taken</i>
<i>the terrorist James Heller into custody. </i>

25
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,071
<i>In three hours, Heller will be tried</i>
<i>for war crimes against humanity. </i>

26
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:03,393
<i>If he is proven guilty, he will be executed</i>
<i>in accordance with our laws. </i>

27
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,711
Sir.

28
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:25,000
As you know, the secretary of defense and his
daughter have been kidnapped by terrorists.

29
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:30,393
The terrorists have announced that they'll put
Jim on trial for war crimes, then execute him,

30
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,310
all of it broadcast for the world.

31
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,234
<i>Make no mistake. </i>
<i>This country is under attack. </i>

32
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,399
Foreign terrorists are operating on our soil.

33
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:45,473
Intelligence indicates that
the kidnapping may be some kind of trigger.

34
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,950
The first step in a series of larger attacks.

35
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,077
Mark, what kind of
protective actions are being taken?

36
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,516
<i>We've changed all the codes</i>
<i>the secretary has knowledge of. </i>

37
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,160
<i>The other cabinet members</i>
<i>have been sequestered. </i>

38
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:02,279
Melissa, where are we with keeping
these people from broadcasting this?

39
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,828
The media outlets will not air it,

40
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:09,550
but the terrorists have announced that
they'll use the Internet. We can't control that.

41
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:13,679
Their feed is untraceable,
and we can't shut down the Internet

42
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,389
without disabling the functions
of the government and the economy.

43
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:21,029
<i>Mr President,</i>
<i>the only way to stop this is at the source. </i>

44
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,752
- <i>We have to rescue Secretary Heller. </i>
- Erin, where is CTU on this?

45
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,435
<i>We have search teams out in force. </i>
<i>We're working a few active leads. </i>

46
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,159
- <i>Anything promising?</i>
- <i>We'll know very shortly. </i>

47
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,629
<i>Keep us closely posted. </i>

48
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,950
Nothing takes priority over finding the people
who have Jim Heller, and stopping them.

49
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,031
Thank you.

50
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,278
- Where are we with Heller's son?
- Finding out what he knows.

51
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,558
If he had anything to do with his father's
abduction, we need to know. Get on it.

52
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:08,111
- Try his emergency frequency.
- Where's Ronnie and Bauer with the witness?

53
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,633
- We don't know.
- What?

54
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:13,713
I just spoke to transit police.
A hostile intercepted Andrew Paige.

55
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,553
- We can't reach Ronnie or Jack.
- What do you mean?

56
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:22,476
They're not answering their phones. There's
been a report of a shooting at the station.

57
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,350
Get pictures of Andrew Paige to our people.
And set up a security grid around the station.

58
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,035
- My system's logged on. I can get it faster.
- All right, fine.

59
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,591
You'll do tactical with me. Let's go, Edgar.

60
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,992
Edgar Stiles.
Miss Driscoll, Jack Bauer's on line one.

61
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,275
Where are you?
Why have you not been in contact?

62
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,511
- Erin, Ronnie's been killed.
- What are you talking about?

63
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:51,310
<i>He was shot by a hostile</i>
<i>who kidnapped Andrew Paige. </i>

64
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:55,234
- Where are you now?
- I'm tracking them, but he doesn't know it.

65
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,756
- I'll send backup.
- Erin, I don't think that's the right call.

66
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,389
I believe that they'll lead me
to Heller and the kidnappers.

67
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:07,315
Listen to me. The terrorists will try
and execute Heller in less than three hours.

68
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:11,678
- Bring the man in now.
- This is our best chance of finding him.

69
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,990
- Jack, we had a deal.
- You're breaking up.

70
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,310
Have SWAT and rescue teams standing by.

71
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,517
I'll call you when the hostile
reaches his destination.

72
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:26,834
- That call. Do you have a location?
- No, it had a block on it.

73
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,033
I've been informed that Ronnie Lobell
has been killed in the line of duty

74
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,839
by a hostile connected to Heller's abduction.

75
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:40,630
At this point, Jack Bauer is no longer
cooperating with this investigation.

76
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,669
All departments need to work on the capture
of Jack Bauer and the hostile he's tracking.

77
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,911
Reconfigure the grid
to include routes from the station.

78
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,992
I want all ground teams on this.

79
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,673
<i> MTA, downtown. </i>

80
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:06,231
This is CTU. Do you have any new
information about the kid who was abducted?

81
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,390
<i>We told you everything a few minutes ago. </i>

82
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:11,517
I can access surveillance cams
if you give me the port codes.

83
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,479
<i>We're looking at them right now. </i>
<i>There's nothing. </i>

84
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,437
Thanks.

85
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,678
- Yes?
- <i>What are you doing there?</i>

86
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,672
- <i>I need you to help me with this grid. </i>
- <i>What kind of help?</i>

87
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,718
- The northeast quadrant is pass-coded...
- <i>Pilot L one. </i>

88
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,314
- What?
- <i>That's the log in. </i>

89
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:37,076
- Chloe, could you just get back here?
- I'm trying to find my friend Andrew.

90
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,314
Get down!

91
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,716
- Yes?
- <i> I have the programmer. </i>

92
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,634
Good. We need to know
what he told CTU as soon as possible.

93
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,836
- <i>Proceed as planned. </i>
- Understood.

94
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,992
- There was a problem at the train station.
- What?

95
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,152
- An agent interfered, I killed him.
- Are you being pursued?

96
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:21,074
No. Anyone who left the station after me
would have caught up to me by now.

97
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:25,153
Unless they don't want you to know
they're there. Take precautions.

98
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:29,028
<i>Make sure that</i>
<i>you are not being followed. Go. </i>

99
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,271
Move!

100
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:38,480
Dad.

101
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,196
You OK?

102
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,160
- Did they hurt you?
- No.

103
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:51,552
They just wanted me present
while they broadcast an announcement.

104
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,757
- They're gonna put me on trial.
- For what?

105
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:59,118
- Crimes against humanity.
- That's ridiculous. When?

106
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,634
Less than three hours.

107
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,759
Jack and the president will do everything
they can. They may get here before then.

108
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:11,799
I can deal with anything
these bastards have got for me.

109
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,350
I wish you hadn't
come this morning, that's all.

110
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:23,116
This is a list of the offences
you are being charged with.

111
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,750
Sign it.

112
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:33,116
I'm a senior member of the United States
Government. I'm not signing it.

113
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,839
Then you will die, Mr Secretary.

114
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,515
Pick up the document and sign it.

115
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,271
- No!
- Let her go!

116
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,318
Leave her alone, you son of a bitch!
Leave her alone!

117
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,597
- Kill her!
- All right. All right, I'll sign it.

118
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,468
Pick up the document.

119
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,910
Pick it up!

120
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,957
Dad.

121
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,913
- Where are we on finding Bauer?
- So far, nowhere.

122
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,356
- That's unacceptable.
- We're working up everything we can.

123
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:50,035
- What are you doing to find Heller?
- I'll find out what his son knows.

124
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:53,032
- Sarah's working on the forensics.
- Anything new yet?

125
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,190
- No.
Great. What else?

126
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,999
- Sarah Gavin.
- I'm tracing the terrorist webcast.

127
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,116
- And?
- I can't get into the file.

128
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:05,228
- In other words, nothing.
- Miss Driscoll, it's the president.

129
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,390
Make something happen.

130
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:14,789
- Yes, Mr President?
- I understand you lost a field operative.

131
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,472
Yes, we did.

132
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,120
Were there any witnesses or prisoners?

133
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,476
- Not yet, but there's some hope.
- Tell me.

134
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:27,111
Jack Bauer, who, as you know, used
to work here, is currently trailing a suspect.

135
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,239
- Trailing? Why doesn't he bring him in?
- We're in the process of doing that.

136
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:37,475
Erin, are we going to be able to save Jim
and his daughter before this "trial" starts?

137
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,915
<i>I certainly hope so, sir. </i>

138
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,312
Mr President, I have to ask you something
now, as we may not have time later.

139
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,469
What?

140
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:51,237
We may end up in a situation where we have
Heller's location, but can't extract him safely.

141
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:56,678
If that's the case, would you authorise
in advance an all-out assault?

142
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:00,036
The assumption being
that the secretary would not survive?

143
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,917
Correct.

144
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,114
We'll cross that bridge
if the scenario presents itself.

145
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,112
- Yes, sir.
- <i>Goodbye, Erin. </i>

146
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,829
- Manning.
- Hey, Curtis, it's Marianne.

147
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,798
- I know you're busy with the kidnapping.
- Yes, I am.

148
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:25,031
My friend said you're calling in
level-five consultants.

149
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,716
- We added personnel because of the crisis.
- She said you struck my name from the list.

150
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,712
- You don't meet the criteria.
- Don't give me that.

151
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,872
I have the qualifications.
Why did you exclude me?

152
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:39,191
You want it straight?
I don't think we'd work well together.

153
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:42,511
Why? Because we slept together
and you stopped calling me?

154
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:46,798
I stopped calling you because you were
using me to get ahead in your career.

155
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,714
That's your interpretation.
You didn't have a problem at the time.

156
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,872
- I'm not having this conversation.
- I'll have it with Erin.

157
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:57,430
- Marianne.
- This would be a huge opportunity for me.

158
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:02,310
And I'm not gonna let you get in the way
because you're uncomfortable.

159
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,198
Where should I post those FBI bulletins?

160
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,396
Exit three.

161
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,428
- O'Brian.
- <i> It's me. Can you talk?</i>

162
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:26,318
- What happened with Andrew?
- Someone got to him.

163
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,868
Did you tell anyone
where we were meeting him?

164
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:33,317
No. What are you doing? Driscoll said
you're operating outside her authority.

165
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,153
- She's not handling this right.
- What if you're wrong?

166
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,392
- This is our best chance of finding Heller.
- If anything happens to Andrew...

167
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:45,031
- Chloe, we have to find these terrorists.
- So why are you calling me?

168
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,750
The hostile's headed toward the canyons.
I need satellite surveillance to track him.

169
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,877
You want me to steal
satellite bandwidth from CTU.

170
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,952
- Yes.
- Where are you?

171
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:01,637
<i>I'm on Orchard Road, just north</i>
<i>of the 14, about four miles east of Valencia. </i>

172
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:06,919
Caltrans has traffic cams in the area. You'll
need satellite coverage nearer the canyons.

173
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,551
Call me back as soon as you've got
the coverage. I'll keep a private channel open.

174
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:14,518
- Who was that?
- It was personal.

175
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,919
- Something wrong?
- I'm not sure. Chloe's acting kinda strange.

176
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,309
That's nothing new.

177
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,391
- Hey. What do you need?
- I just spoke to Marianne Taylor.

178
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,359
Erin, whatever she told you,
it's coming from a very disturbed place.

179
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:50,718
That may be, but she's as qualified
as any of the others you brought in today.

180
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,791
I'm not comfortable with her.

181
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,474
- That should be enough.
- Normally, it would be.

182
00:14:55,560 --> 00:15:00,839
She mentioned that your pillow talk included
a synopsis of the new data-mining protocols.

183
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:06,552
That's a lie. If she got that information, it was
from someone else. She's using it against me.

184
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:11,509
She knows details about the new UVX system.
That's classified information.

185
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,957
She can force us into a security reboot
and a six-month investigation.

186
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,350
- I don't believe this.
- I asked her to come in.

187
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,391
Deal with it.

188
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,995
Do you have the results
on Secretary Heller's son yet?

189
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,877
Yeah.

190
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:35,633
The polygraph shows he had
no knowing involvement in the kidnapping.

191
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,709
But?

192
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,554
He insists he didn't tell anyone
his father was coming to his house.

193
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,677
The polygraph
was inconclusive on that claim.

194
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,149
- You think he's lying?
- It's possible.

195
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,391
Richard was the only one
who knew where his father would be,

196
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,040
and he may have told someone about it.

197
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:55,430
Why would Richard protect
somebody who's betrayed him?

198
00:15:55,520 --> 00:16:00,958
Because he's too arrogant
to believe that's what's happened.

199
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,439
It'll take days
to go through his phone records.

200
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:09,035
I want you to see if you can
get the name out of him another way.

201
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,510
- What do you mean?
- You know what I mean.

202
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:18,673
- Erin, we're not sure he's guilty of anything.
- This is how we'll find out. Get started.

203
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,758
Did Father talk to you about Debbie?

204
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:07,035
What about her?

205
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:14,117
When Dad told me
to take the briefcase to Omar...

206
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:18,990
Debbie followed me. She didn't know
where I was going, she just wanted to talk.

207
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:22,117
Debbie saw the warehouse
where we're holding Heller?

208
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,839
Yes, but there wasn't anything
I could do about it.

209
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:29,072
You could have broken up with her
a month ago like your father and I told you to.

210
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:33,995
I know I made a mistake, but Father found out
and he wants me to get her over here.

211
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:39,632
You know what that means. If he thinks
there's a chance she could expose us...

212
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:46,388
I didn't realise you felt so strongly about her.

213
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,598
She's not going to mess anything up.
I swear to you.

214
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,995
- What do you want me to do?
- Talk to him.

215
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,640
He'll listen to you.

216
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,438
Please.

217
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,272
OK.

218
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:11,989
Your father is on his way to a meeting.

219
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,674
I'll try to reach him.

220
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,790
Thanks, Mom.

221
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,358
- When can I get outta here?
- Secure him.

222
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,669
Goddammit! What the hell are you doing?

223
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:54,116
Get your hands off me!

224
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,318
Who else knew your father
would be at your house?

225
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,834
I told you, no one.

226
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:21,708
- What are you? Crazy?
- <i>This works on a neurotransmitter level. </i>

227
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,712
Makes every nerve ending feel like it's on fire.

228
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,837
You're bluffing.
You know you can't get away with this.

229
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:32,232
By the time you're released, the mark
will be gone. It'll be your word against mine.

230
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,392
My father's the secretary of defense,
for God's sake.

231
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:38,870
I thought you hated him.
Now he's dear old Dad.

232
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:47,149
Help me! Somebody! Please!

233
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,708
Help me!

234
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,192
Stop.

235
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:22,635
I can't do it, Erin.
I'm not gonna let Eric work on Richard Heller.

236
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,995
- Why not?
- Maybe he's protecting a friend,

237
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:28,390
but he wasn't knowingly involved
with the terrorists.

238
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,951
- I gave you an order.
- Then give it to me in writing, Erin.

239
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:36,396
- What are you suggesting? We release him?
- No.

240
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,948
Sensory disorientation gives good results.

241
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:44,512
Cut off his sight, saturate his auditory.
It's noninvasive.

242
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,318
Fine.

243
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,118
Try it.

244
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,196
- Yes.
- <i> I spoke with Behrooz. </i>

245
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:56,478
<i>He told me about his girlfriend. </i>
<i>He's very upset, Navi. </i>

246
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:01,111
That's what concerns me. He has feelings
for this girl despite what he tells us.

247
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,876
- Now she's seen the warehouse.
- I know. It's very troubling.

248
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,997
I told him to get her over to the house.
Did he make the call?

249
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:12,152
No. He asked me to talk to you instead.

250
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:17,597
Go upstairs.
- Are you talking to Father?

251
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:20,672
- I'll talk to you soon.
- You'll take care of this?

252
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,558
- Yes.
- <i>Thank you. </i>

253
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:31,196
What did he say? Do I still
have to call Debbie and get her over here?

254
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,793
No.

255
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,589
Thank you, Mother.

256
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,196
I'm gonna pull over soon
and we're gonna talk, OK?

257
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,476
Good.

258
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:07,435
There are some things I need you to know.

259
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,633
Today is not about me or you.

260
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,235
It's about something bigger.

261
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,676
What I need to know is that
whatever you saw on the Internet

262
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,957
will not interfere with what we have planned.

263
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,558
You have to convince me of that.

264
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,796
Yeah?

265
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,270
It will be a while on the satellite.
The load is through the roof.

266
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:19,150
- How much longer?
- I'm not sure. What is your position exactly?

267
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,834
The suspect pulled over
just past mile-marker 31.

268
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,797
Why? There's nothing there.

269
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:27,953
I don't know. I gotta go. Get back to me
as soon as you got the satellite coverage.

270
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,838
Get up.

271
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,751
Nobody! Nobody!

272
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,270
- Jack, I'm watching this.
- How?

273
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,828
On a traffic cam. You've gotta stop this.

274
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:43,629
If I intercede now, we lose
our opportunity to find Secretary Heller.

275
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,790
What did you tell CTU?

276
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:49,156
That someone was going to put
positioning code on the Internet.

277
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,390
- What else?
- I tried to dig deeper,

278
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:56,679
but everything was in some kind of Arabic.
I couldn't read it.

279
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:00,673
- That's all you told CTU?
- Yes. I promise.

280
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:07,751
- Are you sure?
- Jack, stop them. Just stop them.

281
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:15,756
That's all I know. I swear, I promise.
Please, just don't hit me any more. Please.

282
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:29,709
I talked to the programmer. He didn't tell
CTU enough for them to be able to stop us.

283
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:33,270
- Are you sure?
- Yes. He only got a brief glimpse of the code.

284
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,510
He was never logged on to our server.

285
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:40,116
I need you here. Get back on the road.
Have them see what else they can find out.

286
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:44,079
- And then get rid of the body.
- I will see you soon.

287
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,389
Talk!

288
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,680
Chloe, how do you open
a secure pipe to Division?

289
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,069
- Ask Edgar.
- I did. He's busy.

290
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,958
- I'm busy.
- Why are you so impatient with everybody?

291
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:03,113
Not everybody, just you.
Now, please go away.

292
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,189
Bitch.

293
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:13,319
- What's happening?
- I've got to follow the hostile.

294
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:17,279
Jack, you can't leave Andrew there.
They'll kill him. Jack!

295
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,432
Jack, please! Jack?

296
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,150
Jack?

297
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:59,713
- Jack?
- Yeah?

298
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:05,310
- Is Andrew alive?
- Yes. Dispatch an ambulance to this location.

299
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:08,756
Get me the damn satellite coverage.

300
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:37,076
That's right. Just off the road next to the
31 mile-marker. Get there as fast as you can.

301
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,711
What's wrong?

302
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:53,189
When the trial begins,
you may have an opportunity to escape.

303
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:57,193
You have to take it, even if it's dangerous.

304
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:03,798
- Maybe we'll have a chance before then.
- They'll never take their eyes off of me.

305
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:07,873
It has to be when their attention is on the trial.

306
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:13,555
- I don't want to get out of here without...
- Forget about me.

307
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:17,713
You have to take every chance. Promise me.

308
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,791
Dad, I... I... I can't.

309
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,110
Yes, you can. You can.

310
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,668
I want you to live your life.

311
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:27,115
A full life.

312
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,753
I want you to have a family.

313
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:34,632
That's all I care about.

314
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,995
You're my baby.

315
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:44,234
- I can't do it.
- Yes, you can. You can do it.

316
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,390
Come on, now.

317
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:14,155
- Chloe, you want me to get that?
- No. O'Brian.

318
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:18,199
- <i> Chloe, it's me. </i>
- I was looking at the CHP dispatch report.

319
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,794
Andrew is in really bad shape.

320
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,758
I will never forgive you. Do you hear me?

321
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,991
I understand how you feel,
but you've gotta think clearly.

322
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:31,710
We have terrorists who bombed a train
and kidnapped the secretary of defense.

323
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:35,270
We have to follow this hostile
and hope he leads us to Heller.

324
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:38,238
No. I'm not listening to you any more.
This is over.

325
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,914
- I'm going to Driscoll.
- No. You know I'm right.

326
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,116
No, I don't.

327
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:49,240
Chloe, if you didn't believe in what I was
doing, you'd have turned me in already.

328
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,157
- I hate that this is happening.
- So do I.

329
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:04,512
Chloe, I can't do this without you.
I need your help to stop them.

330
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,397
- <i>Chloe. </i>
- What?

331
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,509
Are you with me?

332
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:15,475
Yeah. I'll call as soon as I have the satellite.

333
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,949
- <i>Thank you. </i>
- Yeah.

334
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:32,670
- Miss Driscoll, this is Marianne Taylor.
- Thank you. Ms Taylor.

335
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:36,070
I'm very excited to have
this opportunity to help you here.

336
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,674
- Hello, Curtis.
- Marianne.

337
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:44,278
Curtis, take Marianne to an empty station
and get her started on the data sorts.

338
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,071
Let's go.

339
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:52,273
You'll be working over here.

340
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:56,876
You know, Curtis, I didn't want to go
over your head, but you left me no choice.

341
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,873
- Is that so?
- I'll let it go if you will.

342
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,794
Get to work, Marianne.

343
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,951
- Is there a problem?
- No. Why?

344
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:22,271
- What are you working on?
- A Division protocol manifest.

345
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:26,319
I need you to build a firewall
around station four.

346
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,277
- Who's that?
- Marianne.

347
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:31,079
I want to make sure
she doesn't stray from her area.

348
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:34,232
Fine.

349
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,788
- O'Brian.
- <i> What's going on?</i>

350
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:40,314
- I don't think I can do this, Jack.
- Why?

351
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:44,791
I'm spread too thin. I've got to get a satellite
on an overloaded system. I need more time.

352
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:49,032
We don't have it. In five minutes
we'll be on Route 11. It's a two-lane road.

353
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:54,319
We'll be the only cars for miles. There's
no way I can follow him without being seen.

354
00:32:54,400 --> 00:33:00,077
All right. I think I know a way
I can speed this up. I'll get back to you.

355
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:24,597
<i>The satellite system tanked</i>
<i>and Driscoll wants these updates. </i>

356
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:27,240
OK, I'll be right there.

357
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:37,350
I hope Driscoll doesn't get upset.
She overreacts sometimes.

358
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,476
This happened to me a few days ago.

359
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:42,950
You can retrieve your files
from the backups in the server room.

360
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,031
Good idea.

361
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:08,070
- Yeah?
- <i> I stole a block of time. </i>

362
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:11,550
There's no continuous coverage.
I'll have to order a reposition.

363
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:17,237
Fine, then do it. Hold on. We're catching
a break. He's pulling into a gas station.

364
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:21,154
<i> Well, I hope he stays there a while. </i>
<i>This will take some time. </i>

365
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:25,313
- Get back to me as soon as you've got it.
- OK, I will.

366
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,232
- Edgar?
- Yeah.

367
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:57,074
I'm Marianne Taylor. Driscoll asked me
to help on data and logistics.

368
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:59,515
I heard something about that. Hi.

369
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:03,309
- So can you do me a favour?
- A favour?

370
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:07,712
Yeah. Everyone's busy. I'd be more useful
if I had an overall on what's going on.

371
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,314
The secretary of defense has been kidnapped.

372
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:14,029
- I know. I mean tactically.
- I don't have time for this. I'm busy.

373
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:17,999
- Why don't you give me the main points?
- All right.

374
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:20,992
- We think Bauer's following a terrorist.
- "We think"?

375
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:25,312
- Yeah. He's off on his own. We can't find him.
- I thought he didn't work here.

376
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:28,995
He doesn't. Driscoll gave him
the authority to do this one thing.

377
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:31,674
All right. Thanks, Edgar.

378
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,952
Richard.

379
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,400
How long do you think it's been?

380
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,118
What?

381
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:29,671
How long do you think
you've been sitting here like this?

382
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,228
Three, four hours.

383
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:40,758
It's been less than 30 minutes.

384
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:46,915
Time's the first thing you lose track of
in sensory disorientation. It only gets worse.

385
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,788
This is illegal. You can't keep me here.

386
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:55,431
- Tell me what I need to know.
- I told you everything I know.

387
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,829
Your father was kidnapped by terrorists.

388
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:02,198
Our analysis shows that you're hiding
something that might help us find him.

389
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:08,196
- Just tell me what it is and all this stops.
- You're not going to do this.

390
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:11,636
If you don't care enough
about your father to tell me,

391
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:14,439
I'll get it out of you this way.

392
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:26,632
You're not gonna do this!

393
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,917
Please! Stop!

394
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,434
You're not gonna...

395
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,838
Stop it! Stop it!

396
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,393
Stop it!

397
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,191
O'Brian.

398
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:02,229
- <i> How long for the satellite reposition?</i>
- My request is still in the queue.

399
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,880
We've got to get
that coverage up and running.

400
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:09,351
There's nothing I can do. You'll have
to stall him. It'll take as long as it takes.

401
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,795
- Just hurry.
- OK, I will.

402
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,829
Why is Debbie here?

403
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:29,755
- What did you do?
- I called her and asked her to come over.

404
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:32,798
You said that you would help me.
That you talked to Father.

405
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:36,111
Your father is right.
We need to find out who she told.

406
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:40,716
- I told you she didn't see anything.
- Then there shouldn't be any problem.

407
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:45,396
- What did you say to her?
- That I was concerned about the two of you.

408
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,316
- Mom.
- Behrooz...

409
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:51,309
You know what's at stake.

410
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:54,949
You do as you're told. Understand?

411
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,393
- Debbie, thank you for coming.
- Sure.

412
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,955
- Hi.
- Hi.

413
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,589
Come in.

414
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,750
Debbie, please...

415
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:21,590
make yourself comfortable in the living room.
I'll make tea.

416
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,990
- Hi.
- Hey.

417
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,871
I'm glad your mom called.

418
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:34,839
- If she has problems with us we should talk.
- Debbie.

419
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:38,469
- What's wrong?
- You don't understand.

420
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:41,552
You shouldn't have come here.

421
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:46,237
Why do you always say things like that?

422
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,636
O'Brian.

423
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:20,917
Will I have satellite coverage
in the next minute or two?

424
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,150
It'll take at least five.

425
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:25,595
- That's too long.
- That's the best I can do.

426
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:31,676
Dammit. I'm gonna have to figure out a way
to keep this guy here. Keep working on it.

427
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,834
Everybody put your hands up now!
You, don't move.

428
