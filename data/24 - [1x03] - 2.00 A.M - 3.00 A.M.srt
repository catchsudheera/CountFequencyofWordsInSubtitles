1
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,569
Authorisation?

2
00:02:48,661 --> 00:02:50,893
Bauer, 4393, CTU.

3
00:03:24,735 --> 00:03:28,254
- OK, we're on it.
- Get back to me as soon as you get a match.

4
00:03:38,709 --> 00:03:40,986
- Bauer.
- Jack, I talked to her.

5
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:44,106
Thank God. What'd she say?

6
00:03:44,194 --> 00:03:47,632
- She and Janet went to some party.
- So are you gonna pick 'em up?

7
00:03:47,717 --> 00:03:50,187
- I don't know where she is. She wouldn't say.
- What?

8
00:03:50,279 --> 00:03:54,799
Well, I don't know, maybe I'm being paranoid,
but she sounded... different.

9
00:03:54,884 --> 00:03:59,598
I don't know. She told me that she loved me
before she hung up. That's not Kim.

10
00:03:59,688 --> 00:04:03,047
She knows she'll get grounded.
She's trying to reduce the sentence.

11
00:04:03,132 --> 00:04:07,128
Yeah, you're probably right.
How are you? Are you OK?

12
00:04:07,215 --> 00:04:11,178
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. Look,
is that guy York still with you?

13
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:15,451
- Yeah, he's gonna take me home now.
- Shouldn't you wait by Janet's car?

14
00:04:15,543 --> 00:04:18,618
Who knows what shape the girls
are gonna be in when they get back?

15
00:04:18,706 --> 00:04:22,099
Well, no. Alan doesn't seem
to think that's necessary.

16
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:25,947
- Why don't you put Alan on the phone?
- Jack, don't do this.

17
00:04:26,033 --> 00:04:28,755
- Teri, just put him on the phone.
- OK.

18
00:04:30,318 --> 00:04:33,312
Alan, my husband
would like to speak with you.

19
00:04:35,202 --> 00:04:38,116
- Hi, this is Alan.
- Alan, Jack Bauer.

20
00:04:38,205 --> 00:04:41,484
Can't thank you enough
for helping out with this.

21
00:04:41,568 --> 00:04:46,043
- I'm just glad the girls are with each other.
- Me too. Look, I'm stuck at work.

22
00:04:46,132 --> 00:04:47,122
Yeah. Teri said...

23
00:04:47,214 --> 00:04:51,449
I would appreciate it if you would hang out
at the store and wait for them to return.

24
00:04:51,537 --> 00:04:55,329
Uh, I don't think they're gonna be
back here for at least a couple of hours.

25
00:04:55,421 --> 00:05:00,375
It's a pretty rough neighbourhood and I'd hate
for there to be a problem when they return.

26
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:02,902
- Sure. We'll stay.
- Thank you.

27
00:05:03,949 --> 00:05:05,065
Thank you.

28
00:05:05,591 --> 00:05:08,505
You gotta be kidding me.
We had a deal, Mandy.

29
00:05:08,594 --> 00:05:13,273
You promised to get Belkin's ID in exchange
for $1 million. Now she wants to double it?

30
00:05:13,358 --> 00:05:16,797
- She doesn't know how this works.
- No, this is your fault.

31
00:05:16,881 --> 00:05:21,676
- You should never have involved an amateur.
- If I'm such an amateur, how...

32
00:05:21,766 --> 00:05:27,722
- I'm just trying to get us more money.
- There is no money. Not any more.

33
00:05:27,812 --> 00:05:31,694
Ira, don't turn this into
something else. I will fix it.

34
00:05:35,298 --> 00:05:37,291
What?

35
00:05:38,262 --> 00:05:40,333
No, we don't have it yet.

36
00:05:40,424 --> 00:05:42,894
Yes. No, of course.

37
00:05:43,707 --> 00:05:46,507
I will get back to you as soon as we're ready.

38
00:05:54,157 --> 00:05:56,798
Talk to her. Explain what I do.

39
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,955
- I will, but our deal stands.
- Take care of it!

40
00:06:12,614 --> 00:06:15,255
I need to get out of here, my friend.

41
00:06:15,337 --> 00:06:18,058
It'll just be a little longer.

42
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:33,947
We've been getting death threats ever since
my husband announced his candidacy.

43
00:06:34,034 --> 00:06:38,635
- What is different about this one?
- I'm not privy to that kind of information.

44
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:44,479
All I can tell you is that my unit is only called
in when the threat becomes more serious.

45
00:06:44,565 --> 00:06:47,240
Then why did you let him
walk out on his own?

46
00:06:47,327 --> 00:06:49,638
We will find him, Mrs. Palmer.

47
00:06:52,691 --> 00:06:56,085
I, uh, I'm sorry.
We're grateful to have you here.

48
00:06:57,337 --> 00:07:01,015
- He's not in the lobby. I looked everywhere.
- You shouldn't leave the suites.

49
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:05,222
- Let these men do their jobs.
- There's a coffee shop a few blocks down.

50
00:07:05,304 --> 00:07:09,745
- I bet he wanted to be by himself. I'll get him.
- No, Keith. You're not going anywhere.

51
00:07:09,828 --> 00:07:12,709
Secret Service knows this city
a lot better than we do.

52
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:15,227
- I'll be right back.
- I'm sorry, son.

53
00:07:15,314 --> 00:07:18,114
- We need you to stay here.
- Why?

54
00:07:18,196 --> 00:07:21,875
We treat a threat on a candidate's life
as a threat to the entire family.

55
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:24,317
We need to protect you as well.

56
00:07:24,401 --> 00:07:26,041
Keith...

57
00:07:26,564 --> 00:07:29,286
Your father's going to be fine.

58
00:07:56,913 --> 00:08:00,113
- Yeah?
- Gaines. I need an update on the Bauer girl.

59
00:08:00,196 --> 00:08:02,918
Everything's copa. We're just waiting for you.

60
00:08:02,998 --> 00:08:06,836
- I'm running a little late.
- We're not going anywhere.

61
00:08:06,922 --> 00:08:09,803
That's right, you're not.

62
00:08:09,885 --> 00:08:12,960
She's in a lot of pain, man.
I think you broke her arm.

63
00:08:13,048 --> 00:08:17,648
Think so? Should we take her
to the hospital and get some x-rays?

64
00:08:18,653 --> 00:08:21,887
Gaines is running late. I'm gonna
smoke another j. You want one?

65
00:08:21,976 --> 00:08:23,969
Sure.

66
00:08:29,904 --> 00:08:32,375
My arm... My arm...

67
00:08:34,468 --> 00:08:36,938
Dan, please. She needs to see a doctor.

68
00:08:42,636 --> 00:08:47,555
- At least give her something, man.
- I'm not wasting my stash on her.

69
00:08:50,003 --> 00:08:53,203
So, what, is Dan the boss
and you do everything he says?

70
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:10,092
Thought I told you...

71
00:09:13,665 --> 00:09:15,862
Don't press me, man.

72
00:09:20,712 --> 00:09:23,023
I should never have used you.

73
00:09:38,008 --> 00:09:40,366
You're gonna give her that?

74
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:42,762
Want me to take away the pain or not?

75
00:11:10,616 --> 00:11:12,369
Hey.

76
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:16,341
Hey, man, this is a private lot, homey.
You gotta pay to park here.

77
00:11:16,421 --> 00:11:19,177
I see. And you're the attendant?

78
00:11:19,665 --> 00:11:24,060
That's right. And it's gonna cost you
a hundred dollars. So deal it up.

79
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:37,119
You that dude! Uh, Palmer.

80
00:11:37,201 --> 00:11:40,560
- No. That's not me.
- Yeah, it's you. It's him!

81
00:11:40,645 --> 00:11:43,957
Yo, this guy's running for president, dog.
I seen him on TV.

82
00:11:44,848 --> 00:11:47,684
Yeah? Yeah, yeah.

83
00:11:47,771 --> 00:11:51,848
Yeah. So what you gonna
do for me, Mr. President?

84
00:11:52,655 --> 00:11:56,414
See, that's your problem.
You want everyone else to do the work.

85
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:59,172
What are you gonna do for yourselves?

86
00:11:59,262 --> 00:12:02,701
See, man? All y'all, y'all got the same rap.

87
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:08,428
Keep going like this...
and you'll be dead in five years.

88
00:12:09,352 --> 00:12:12,505
- Man, like you know my life.
- More than you think.

89
00:12:30,372 --> 00:12:31,886
Whoo!

90
00:12:32,294 --> 00:12:34,047
Yeah!

91
00:12:34,135 --> 00:12:36,128
Whoo!

92
00:13:05,965 --> 00:13:08,242
- CTU. Myers.
- Hey, it's me.

93
00:13:08,327 --> 00:13:11,049
- Jack, where are you?
- About a block away.

94
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:15,606
I need you to print up a hard copy of Tony's
passenger breakdown and put it on my desk.

95
00:13:15,694 --> 00:13:18,655
Wait for me. I wanna talk to you,
but not in front of the others.

96
00:13:18,737 --> 00:13:21,732
- Sure.
- Great. I'll be there in a minute. Bye.

97
00:13:49,927 --> 00:13:54,049
Keep working. Has Division responded
to the two dead agents yet?

98
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:56,601
- Yeah, they're picking them up now.
- Good.

99
00:13:56,974 --> 00:13:59,444
- Anyone we know?
- Someone we know.

100
00:14:00,456 --> 00:14:02,927
I'm afraid it was Richard Walsh.

101
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:06,821
I'm sorry, Jamey,
I know what he meant to you.

102
00:14:08,865 --> 00:14:11,540
What is going on? Is this
anything to do with Palmer?

103
00:14:11,627 --> 00:14:16,421
That's what we gotta find out. Look,
I don't have time to go into all the details,

104
00:14:16,511 --> 00:14:20,714
but I've got to put you in a difficult position.
You're the only person I can trust.

105
00:14:20,796 --> 00:14:22,754
What do you mean?

106
00:14:22,838 --> 00:14:27,439
Walsh said we've got a problem on the inside.
He told me to talk only to you.

107
00:14:31,366 --> 00:14:35,841
This is the key card I sent you. On it is
pertinent information to the hit on Palmer.

108
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:39,289
How long is it gonna take you
to pull all the data off it?

109
00:14:39,374 --> 00:14:43,256
Depending on the kind of encryption,
it could take hours.

110
00:14:43,337 --> 00:14:45,455
Palmer's day starts at six.

111
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:51,256
I need it before then.

112
00:14:55,068 --> 00:15:00,467
One more thing. I need to be certain that
it was Nina's computer that burnt that card.

113
00:15:00,553 --> 00:15:02,705
Why?

114
00:15:02,795 --> 00:15:04,948
Because if it was, she's dirty.

115
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:09,361
I'll need a few minutes
alone at her workstation.

116
00:15:09,442 --> 00:15:11,435
Fine. You got it.

117
00:15:12,605 --> 00:15:14,916
Did you cut yourself?

118
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:19,561
- Yeah. What are you working on?
- I gave Nina the passenger list.

119
00:15:19,651 --> 00:15:22,042
I'm cross-checking everything else we've got.

120
00:15:22,134 --> 00:15:24,491
Good. I'll be down in a sec.

121
00:15:34,745 --> 00:15:38,219
- So why were you at Dunlop Plaza?
- I had a meeting with Walsh.

122
00:15:38,309 --> 00:15:41,065
- Is that the passenger list?
- Yes.

123
00:15:41,152 --> 00:15:42,950
Anything unusual?

124
00:15:43,034 --> 00:15:46,950
There's one red flag. A man in first class.
His information is inconsistent.

125
00:15:47,038 --> 00:15:50,829
- I'm trying to piece it together now.
- Good.

126
00:15:53,764 --> 00:15:56,155
I don't wanna tell you how to do your job,

127
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:59,640
but not letting me know where you are,
holding back information...

128
00:15:59,729 --> 00:16:02,371
How can I help you without you letting me?

129
00:16:08,858 --> 00:16:11,215
Do you think that it's possible

130
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:15,138
that someone from within the agency
is behind the hit on Palmer?

131
00:16:16,905 --> 00:16:19,900
Anything's possible. Do you have a lead?

132
00:16:23,632 --> 00:16:26,149
No. Not really.

133
00:16:27,235 --> 00:16:28,795
No.

134
00:16:28,877 --> 00:16:31,917
Why do I feel like
you're not telling me the truth?

135
00:16:35,443 --> 00:16:38,563
If you've got something, tell me.
I'll work it up with you.

136
00:16:38,646 --> 00:16:40,639
No, I'm...

137
00:16:41,689 --> 00:16:44,000
I'm just thinking out loud.

138
00:16:44,091 --> 00:16:46,289
OK. Fine.

139
00:16:49,016 --> 00:16:51,487
Is there anything else?

140
00:16:51,579 --> 00:16:53,013
No.

141
00:16:55,061 --> 00:16:57,054
Actually, there is.

142
00:17:00,347 --> 00:17:02,544
Are you seeing Tony?

143
00:17:05,432 --> 00:17:07,425
Why?

144
00:17:10,957 --> 00:17:12,836
Is it serious?

145
00:17:12,918 --> 00:17:14,956
What is this, Jack?

146
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:18,833
What do you want to know? Am I over you?
Why are we talking about this now?

147
00:17:18,924 --> 00:17:22,238
I'm trying to understand why
he's been giving me such a hard time.

148
00:17:22,328 --> 00:17:24,969
Yeah, well, I can't answer that for you.

149
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:33,409
Hold on.

150
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,694
- Yeah?
- I confirmed it.

151
00:17:37,782 --> 00:17:41,699
The file on the key card definitely
came from Nina's computer.

152
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:48,744
OK. Thank you.

153
00:17:52,996 --> 00:17:54,989
It's Division.

154
00:17:55,078 --> 00:17:58,313
They want the passenger breakdown.
Please send it to them.

155
00:17:58,402 --> 00:18:00,395
Sure.

156
00:18:03,967 --> 00:18:06,164
By the way, your wife called.

157
00:18:24,987 --> 00:18:26,626
- Bauer.
- This is Data Services.

158
00:18:26,709 --> 00:18:29,669
- You called in a thumbprint an hour ago?
- Yeah.

159
00:18:29,751 --> 00:18:32,666
We checked every database we have. Nothing.

160
00:18:32,755 --> 00:18:36,193
Either this guy doesn't exist
or his identity was wiped off the record.

161
00:18:36,278 --> 00:18:38,270
Thank you.

162
00:18:50,972 --> 00:18:55,891
- This is gonna work out better for both of us.
- I don't care, Bridgit. Where is the ID?

163
00:18:55,976 --> 00:19:00,258
This is not some secret I'm keeping
from you. This is for both of us.

164
00:19:01,341 --> 00:19:04,780
- Do you wanna get both of us killed?
- They hired you to blow up a plane.

165
00:19:04,865 --> 00:19:07,825
Another million dollars
means nothing to these people.

166
00:19:07,908 --> 00:19:12,224
You're wrong. Money is the only thing
"these people" care about.

167
00:19:14,994 --> 00:19:17,192
Let's do it anyway.

168
00:19:18,678 --> 00:19:21,069
You know he can't hurt us.

169
00:19:23,322 --> 00:19:25,315
Baby...

170
00:19:26,805 --> 00:19:29,368
Nobody can hurt us.

171
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:34,443
One million for you,

172
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:37,649
one million for me.

173
00:19:38,936 --> 00:19:41,533
Don't you like the way that sounds?

174
00:19:55,192 --> 00:19:57,185
OK.

175
00:19:59,836 --> 00:20:01,750
We're gonna do this your way.

176
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:04,434
Great. OK, let's tell him.

177
00:20:04,521 --> 00:20:07,402
No. It'll be better if I do it myself.

178
00:20:11,367 --> 00:20:13,838
You're always looking out for me.

179
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:27,373
- What happened?
- Do you remember anything?

180
00:20:27,463 --> 00:20:29,615
Yeah.

181
00:20:29,705 --> 00:20:34,146
We were at the furniture store...
dancing... Where's Dan?

182
00:20:34,229 --> 00:20:36,426
Shh.

183
00:20:36,672 --> 00:20:38,585
Dan broke your arm.

184
00:20:38,673 --> 00:20:41,509
He didn't break my arm. Dan likes me.

185
00:20:41,596 --> 00:20:43,429
Yeah, look at it.

186
00:20:43,518 --> 00:20:45,396
Ow... My arm...

187
00:20:46,882 --> 00:20:48,760
OK.

188
00:20:48,843 --> 00:20:50,836
Come on.

189
00:20:52,887 --> 00:20:56,086
Listen to me. This is serious.
We're being kidnapped.

190
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:58,767
We need to escape. Can you walk?

191
00:21:00,574 --> 00:21:03,136
- I guess.
- OK. Come on.

192
00:21:09,302 --> 00:21:12,103
Get ready. When I say "go", we go.

193
00:21:12,745 --> 00:21:14,339
Go where?

194
00:21:14,427 --> 00:21:16,659
Just stay with me, OK?

195
00:21:16,749 --> 00:21:19,311
You gotta understand this, OK?

196
00:21:19,392 --> 00:21:22,626
We could die if we don't
get out of here. Hold my hand.

197
00:21:26,238 --> 00:21:27,752
Go.

198
00:21:32,565 --> 00:21:33,760
Hey!

199
00:21:33,845 --> 00:21:36,521
- Hey!
- No! Get back here!

200
00:21:39,291 --> 00:21:41,568
- We gotta get them.
- Hey!

201
00:21:45,857 --> 00:21:47,258
- Catch them!
- I am!

202
00:21:47,338 --> 00:21:49,935
This is your fault!
This is what I was talking about!

203
00:21:50,021 --> 00:21:51,615
Shut up!

204
00:21:54,065 --> 00:21:57,265
- Get back here!
- We gotta get them. They can not get away.

205
00:21:57,348 --> 00:22:00,228
This is good work.
Keep me informed. Thank you.

206
00:22:00,311 --> 00:22:02,304
- Certainly.
- Thanks, Jack.

207
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:06,107
Shut the door.

208
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:12,712
- Are we saying Nina's a traitor?
- Not yet. We need to know more.

209
00:22:12,803 --> 00:22:15,842
Should I shut down her confidential access?

210
00:22:15,925 --> 00:22:20,081
No, that'll slow everything down. There's
gotta be some kind of explanation for this.

211
00:22:20,169 --> 00:22:23,050
Right now what I really need
is the data off that card.

212
00:22:23,132 --> 00:22:27,607
But aren't we obligated to seal off
her channels with this much evidence?

213
00:22:27,696 --> 00:22:30,293
Look, you were seeing her, weren't you?

214
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:35,172
- That is none of your business.
- I think in this case it is.

215
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:42,706
Yes. When my wife and I were separated,
yes, I was seeing Nina.

216
00:22:42,791 --> 00:22:45,786
- Did you say anything you shouldn't have?
- No.

217
00:22:49,757 --> 00:22:51,750
I don't think so.

218
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:56,042
I trusted her... with everything
that was coming through here, but...

219
00:22:59,646 --> 00:23:02,527
- Fine. Shut down her access.
- OK. What's she working on?

220
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:05,763
- 747 passenger list.
- Good. That's not on a secure socket.

221
00:23:05,852 --> 00:23:08,654
- I can do it without her knowing.
- Good.

222
00:23:11,458 --> 00:23:14,612
- Jamey?
- Don't worry, I won't say anything.

223
00:23:16,022 --> 00:23:18,015
Thank you.

224
00:23:32,558 --> 00:23:34,551
Gotta get them.

225
00:23:41,326 --> 00:23:44,127
- Hey, get outta here.
- Where'd they go?

226
00:23:50,855 --> 00:23:54,932
- Ah, forget it.
- Aw, come on, man. Come on. Don't.

227
00:23:55,019 --> 00:23:57,455
Hey, come back! Scumbag.

228
00:23:57,861 --> 00:24:01,414
You just cost me 50 bucks!
You're gonna pay for this.

229
00:24:03,907 --> 00:24:07,301
- Word up.
- Did you see two girls run past here?

230
00:24:08,992 --> 00:24:11,589
- Yeah, I seen 'em.
- Which way did they go?

231
00:24:13,396 --> 00:24:15,833
- Who are they?
- Did you see 'em or not?

232
00:24:21,244 --> 00:24:24,080
They went down Central.

233
00:24:24,848 --> 00:24:27,125
Check it out. I'll look around here.

234
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:30,127
- Yeah?
- It's Gaines. How's it going?

235
00:24:30,213 --> 00:24:34,290
- Everything's fine.
- Change of plan. We meet at a new location.

236
00:24:34,376 --> 00:24:36,609
Just let me know. I'll meet you there.

237
00:24:38,461 --> 00:24:41,934
- We need to get to a phone.
- No, you need to pay up.

238
00:25:01,482 --> 00:25:03,315
Is this real?

239
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:06,316
Thank you very much.

240
00:25:58,135 --> 00:26:01,050
- What couldn't wait till morning?
- Maureen Kingsley called.

241
00:26:01,138 --> 00:26:03,529
Said she had some new information.

242
00:26:04,261 --> 00:26:06,983
David, you got me out of bed
at 2am. What did she say?

243
00:26:07,064 --> 00:26:10,343
She said the Gibson boy,
the one who... raped Nicole,

244
00:26:10,428 --> 00:26:12,466
didn't commit suicide.

245
00:26:12,549 --> 00:26:15,111
That he was thrown out of the window.

246
00:26:16,793 --> 00:26:19,070
So, he was thrown out
of a window. Who cares?

247
00:26:19,155 --> 00:26:21,387
She said it was Keith!

248
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:27,241
She's gonna publicly
accuse my son of murder.

249
00:26:30,926 --> 00:26:34,320
- OK, there's a couple of ways to handle this.
- It's a lie, Carl.

250
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:37,210
It's dirty politics and I won't stand for it.

251
00:26:38,574 --> 00:26:42,491
My family lived through that nightmare
and I won't put Nicole through it again.

252
00:26:42,577 --> 00:26:45,697
- And Keith? Keith couldn't...
- This bastard, Hodges,

253
00:26:45,781 --> 00:26:48,661
he waits till the day of the primary
so you can't respond.

254
00:26:48,743 --> 00:26:51,465
- I don't care what day it is. It's a lie...
- I know.

255
00:26:51,546 --> 00:26:56,499
But we can't pretend today isn't important.
I'll put a lid on Kingsley until the polls close.

256
00:26:56,591 --> 00:27:01,954
- We win the primary then take it from there.
- No. We find the source, make them recant.

257
00:27:02,036 --> 00:27:06,875
Oh, I'll figure out where this is coming from
and I'll cut it off, but, David...

258
00:27:08,082 --> 00:27:12,284
We go back years. You have your principles,
you don't compromise, blah blah blah.

259
00:27:12,365 --> 00:27:16,602
That's why I love you. But you knew
the gloves would come off. Well, they are off.

260
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:19,081
That's why you have me.

261
00:27:19,172 --> 00:27:21,973
Go back and forget about this.

262
00:27:22,055 --> 00:27:24,048
I'm on it.

263
00:27:26,139 --> 00:27:28,781
I can't let them throw my son to the wolves.

264
00:27:28,861 --> 00:27:31,378
David, I'll take care of it.

265
00:27:33,706 --> 00:27:36,176
- Is that you?
- Yeah. You better get lost.

266
00:27:37,229 --> 00:27:39,426
Call you in an hour.

267
00:27:44,195 --> 00:27:46,632
It's OK, fellas.

268
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:48,268
I'm fine.

269
00:28:08,059 --> 00:28:10,052
Dammit.

270
00:28:14,144 --> 00:28:18,266
Janet, let's go back to the front
and wait for them to leave.

271
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:23,348
- They're not on Central.
- Keep looking. We gotta find 'em.

272
00:28:23,433 --> 00:28:26,952
OK, I'll take the side streets.
They're around here somewhere.

273
00:28:27,036 --> 00:28:30,429
Gaines just called me.
We gotta find them!

274
00:28:37,447 --> 00:28:40,407
- You're in my space.
- I'm sorry. We'll leave.

275
00:28:45,173 --> 00:28:48,135
- Is there a phone around here?
- No.

276
00:28:48,216 --> 00:28:51,450
What are you looking for?
You wanna score some dope?

277
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:55,423
We need to get rid of those guys. Is there
any way you can help us get to a phone?

278
00:28:55,503 --> 00:28:57,701
You want me to help you?

279
00:28:59,747 --> 00:29:03,585
What are your little
designer jeans worth? 500 bills?

280
00:29:04,712 --> 00:29:07,512
And those kicks, like another, what, 25?

281
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:15,960
You wanna trade places with me for a while?

282
00:29:16,042 --> 00:29:21,361
Wanna turn some tricks while I go snuggle
with your daddy in the Hollywood foothills?

283
00:29:26,933 --> 00:29:28,926
Go away.

284
00:29:41,066 --> 00:29:44,699
We've been kidnapped. I don't know...

285
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:47,181
Her arm is broken.

286
00:29:47,632 --> 00:29:50,434
Those guys are still out there.

287
00:29:57,081 --> 00:29:59,472
Welcome to the neighbourhood.

288
00:30:01,365 --> 00:30:05,079
Well, is there any other way out
besides the front door?

289
00:30:07,452 --> 00:30:10,492
- But if we just...
- "But" nothing. Get out!

290
00:30:10,814 --> 00:30:12,807
Go!

291
00:30:40,963 --> 00:30:43,718
How long have you been playing me?

292
00:30:43,806 --> 00:30:46,687
- Playing you?
- Playing me.

293
00:30:46,768 --> 00:30:48,681
What are you doing?

294
00:30:49,331 --> 00:30:52,167
- Why don't you tell me about this?
- Tell you what?

295
00:30:52,253 --> 00:30:56,091
You loaded this card
with intel on the hit on Palmer.

296
00:30:56,178 --> 00:30:59,297
I wanna know who you work for
and who you smuggled this card to.

297
00:30:59,381 --> 00:31:01,338
You're delirious.

298
00:31:01,423 --> 00:31:04,144
- Who are you working for?
- I work for you.

299
00:31:04,225 --> 00:31:06,742
Who are you working for?

300
00:31:06,827 --> 00:31:09,390
- Who are you working for?!
- I work for you!

301
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:12,624
Whoever programmed this card
is involved with the hit on Palmer.

302
00:31:12,713 --> 00:31:15,309
This came from your computer.

303
00:31:16,436 --> 00:31:19,512
I don't care where it came from, I didn't do it.

304
00:31:23,524 --> 00:31:26,119
And I can't believe that you think I did.

305
00:31:36,615 --> 00:31:41,455
There it is. One million in your account
in addition to what we already agreed on.

306
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:43,373
Where's the ID?

307
00:31:43,462 --> 00:31:45,740
Let's get it.

308
00:31:45,824 --> 00:31:48,864
- No, just the three of us.
- And why do I trust you?

309
00:31:49,988 --> 00:31:52,186
Because you want the ID.

310
00:32:04,162 --> 00:32:06,358
I'm gonna miss you, Mandy.

311
00:32:19,576 --> 00:32:22,047
- How's your arm?
- It's OK if I don't move it.

312
00:32:22,139 --> 00:32:24,132
Then don't move it.

313
00:32:57,652 --> 00:33:00,647
I know you're in here.
I can smell your perfume.

314
00:33:03,338 --> 00:33:05,854
Where are you?

315
00:33:05,941 --> 00:33:08,411
This is starting to piss me off!

316
00:33:27,801 --> 00:33:29,998
He's gonna be ready.

317
00:33:31,404 --> 00:33:36,004
Hey, I'm telling you, you know, I saw him
work out yesterday. He looked good.

318
00:33:36,089 --> 00:33:38,082
He's gonna be ready.

319
00:33:38,171 --> 00:33:40,768
- Excuse me.
- Let me call you back.

320
00:33:42,495 --> 00:33:46,378
- You looking for something?
- Please, help us. These guys are after us.

321
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:48,610
- What guys?
- I'll pay whatever you want.

322
00:33:48,701 --> 00:33:51,217
Just get us out of here.

323
00:33:51,543 --> 00:33:54,379
- Let's see the money.
- I don't have it on me right now.

324
00:33:54,466 --> 00:33:57,906
But when you get us home,
my parents will pay whatever you want.

325
00:33:57,989 --> 00:34:00,347
Sorry, I run a cash-up-front business.

326
00:34:01,393 --> 00:34:04,193
- What's your name, sweetheart?
- Janet.

327
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:10,992
Look, can we just
use your phone at least? Please?

328
00:34:13,605 --> 00:34:15,757
Come here!

329
00:34:15,846 --> 00:34:19,125
Go! Take the phone and run! Go! Go! Go!

330
00:34:20,811 --> 00:34:22,804
Go!

331
00:34:31,341 --> 00:34:33,015
Run!

332
00:34:34,344 --> 00:34:36,655
- It's cool, man. It's cool.
- Run!

333
00:34:57,406 --> 00:34:59,524
Is this right?

334
00:34:59,608 --> 00:35:02,921
- What?
- They just posted a memorandum.

335
00:35:03,011 --> 00:35:05,209
Richard Walsh is dead.

336
00:35:06,494 --> 00:35:09,295
That can't be. I mean,
he was just here an hour ago.

337
00:35:09,377 --> 00:35:11,688
That's what it says.

338
00:35:20,627 --> 00:35:22,620
Oh, my God.

339
00:35:25,112 --> 00:35:27,469
Can you find out what happened?

340
00:35:27,554 --> 00:35:30,151
Jack's got me working on something.

341
00:35:31,598 --> 00:35:35,196
Can you open up a socket
on the terminal? I'll check it myself.

342
00:35:37,484 --> 00:35:39,203
Sure.

343
00:35:39,286 --> 00:35:41,279
Thanks.

344
00:35:51,657 --> 00:35:54,492
- Farrell.
- I need you up here now. Do you have it yet?

345
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:58,212
- Almost. Another couple of minutes.
- Soon as you're done, come up.

346
00:36:44,868 --> 00:36:46,746
Thank you.

347
00:37:09,051 --> 00:37:11,646
That job this summer - you in?

348
00:37:23,264 --> 00:37:25,063
Yes.

349
00:37:25,746 --> 00:37:28,137
OK, Jonathan, you're done.

350
00:37:42,561 --> 00:37:44,759
You had no choice.

351
00:38:02,421 --> 00:38:08,183
The key card was definitely programmed
on Nina's computer. Login time was 10.14pm.

352
00:38:08,627 --> 00:38:11,702
Looks like the next 20 minutes
were spent gathering data,

353
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:17,347
and then another seven to burn it into
the key card. Logout was 10.41, January 14.

354
00:38:17,435 --> 00:38:21,830
It specifies which files were accessed.
If you want details, there are two screens of...

355
00:38:21,919 --> 00:38:24,196
Wait a sec. What was the date?

356
00:38:24,282 --> 00:38:28,598
- January 14, a couple of months ago.
- Second weekend in January, Jack.

357
00:38:28,685 --> 00:38:30,679
That's all I got.

358
00:38:32,489 --> 00:38:35,484
Thank you, Jamey, that's all I need right now.

359
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:47,343
That was the same weekend that
we were in Santa Barbara together.

360
00:38:53,429 --> 00:38:57,711
So someone from this office has hacked
your login code. They're in your system.

361
00:38:57,793 --> 00:39:00,310
- You were way off on this one, Jack.
- I'm sorry...

362
00:39:00,395 --> 00:39:02,628
How could you?

363
00:39:32,265 --> 00:39:35,579
- Division.
- It's Tony Almeida at CTU.

364
00:39:35,669 --> 00:39:38,663
Look, you'd better get down here right away.

365
00:39:40,674 --> 00:39:44,113
Jack Bauer needs to be
relieved of his command.

366
00:39:58,731 --> 00:40:00,768
- Hello?
- Mom, you gotta come get us.

367
00:40:00,853 --> 00:40:04,850
- What's wrong? Are you at the party?
- There was no party. They made us say that.

368
00:40:04,936 --> 00:40:07,976
- Who?
- These guys. We're in North Hollywood.

369
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:09,619
- Behind...
- Platt's Auto Body.

370
00:40:09,702 --> 00:40:11,853
- Platt's Auto Body.
- They're coming!

371
00:40:11,943 --> 00:40:14,301
- Mom, you gotta come now!
- Kim! Kim!

372
00:40:14,385 --> 00:40:16,219
What's going on? Teri?

373
00:40:16,307 --> 00:40:18,665
- 911 emergency.
- My daughter's in trouble.

374
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:23,031
She's in North Hollywood behind
Platt's Auto Body. Someone was chasing her.

375
00:40:28,799 --> 00:40:30,792
Come on, Kim.

376
00:40:44,014 --> 00:40:46,610
No... No... No!

377
00:40:46,696 --> 00:40:49,610
No, look at me. Look at me!

378
00:40:49,699 --> 00:40:52,500
Oh, God! Oh, God!

379
00:40:53,463 --> 00:40:55,056
No!

380
00:40:55,145 --> 00:40:58,298
- I told you to chill! Why didn't you listen?
- Let go of me! No!

381
00:40:58,387 --> 00:41:00,380
- Shut up!
- No!

382
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:04,625
- What about her?
- Forget her. Let's go.

383
00:41:04,713 --> 00:41:06,706
- Come on!
- No! No!

384
00:41:08,157 --> 00:41:10,548
Come on. Let's keep moving.

385
00:41:15,483 --> 00:41:16,998
Shut up!
