1
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,030
<i>Previously on "24":</i>

2
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:19,319
We've learned that the woman with whom
the president is involved, Dr Anne Packard,

3
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:24,349
is being accused of helping to fabricate
the results of a clinical drug trial.

4
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:28,149
Voters who were on the fence
may have just fallen into Keeler's camp.

5
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,595
Once they find out that Ted was lying...

6
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,558
And how do they do that?
It's he-said-she-said.

7
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:37,838
See, this is politics. It's not medicine.
So do me a favor and stay out of it.

8
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,708
- I'm taking over for Tony.
- We're trying to contact the chopper.

9
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,075
Now we have Singer
and the virus is contained,

10
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,630
we need to let Jack know the attempted
escape of Salazar is pointless.

11
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:50,917
<i>Salazar's terrorist connections
are a threat to this country.</i>

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,231
- Both Salazar and Bauer are expendable.
- What's going on?

13
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,596
Your dad got out of the chopper.
He and Salazar are on the run.

14
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,990
<i>All that matters is telling him
the virus has been contained.</i>

15
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,674
<i>That way, he'll turn Salazar over.</i>

16
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:07,271
Your brother gave the FBI
contact instructions in his last call.

17
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,079
He's got a plane circling,
waiting to pick you up.

18
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,151
You really are the best, Jack.

19
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:17,633
- What the hell is going on?
- You didn't think I'd let you just leave?

20
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,676
Ramón...

21
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,191
Adam!

22
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,510
There's something seriously wrong...

23
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,797
I just remembered,
I forgot to close that file.

24
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:50,871
<i>The following takes place
between 7pm and 8pm.</i>

25
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,756
- Let me go.
- You shouldn't have walked into this.

26
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,717
Calm down. I have to ask you
a few questions, OK?

27
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,394
This room is soundproofed,
so if you scream

28
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:08,076
it won't do anything but make me mad,
and you don't wanna do that.

29
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,792
So are we gonna be all right here?

30
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,956
- What are you doing to my father?
- I'll ask the questions.

31
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,435
You came in here to bring
the logs back up to date.

32
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,080
When do they expect you to finish?

33
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,110
- Don't make me ask you twice.
- I don't know. Ten minutes.

34
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,873
And after that, what are you working on?

35
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,554
Just utility work.

36
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,153
Good.

37
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:48,118
What do you think you're doing?
This isn't gonna work.

38
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,831
- Adam?
- Yeah?

39
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,913
Tony's out of surgery. I'm trying
to head over there in a few minutes.

40
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,911
- Who's gonna be in charge?
- Gael.

41
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,958
Unmount and transfer
all my directories to his system.

42
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,996
- Sure.
- Anything new on Jack?

43
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:37,119
Our last location on him was the
subway station, then Chase lost his trail.

44
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,875
- Have we contacted LAPD?
- They're all over it. So is the FBI.

45
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,554
I think we're going about this
the wrong way.

46
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,552
Jack broke Salazar out of jail
to stop the bio threat,

47
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,154
but now that we have Singer,
there is no threat.

48
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,674
If we saturate the media,
Jack will get the message.

49
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,788
The president does not want the
public to know about the bio threat.

50
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,269
We have to find Jack and Salazar ourselves.

51
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,679
Yeah.

52
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,478
- Dessler.
- Michelle, it's me.

53
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,028
Why aren't you
in the teleconference room?

54
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:13,148
Kim bumped into some embedded no-ops
in the log files. It'll take a few minutes.

55
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,198
She can handle that.
I'm heading to the hospital.

56
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,999
I need you up to speed
so you can take over for me.

57
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,594
- On my way.
- Thank you.

58
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,356
I'm watching you. So don't try anything.

59
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,393
All right?

60
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,240
Transfer all blue-alert key codes to Gael.

61
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,993
- Anything else?
- That's it. Thanks.

62
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,753
There is no longer an outbreak threat
for the city of Los Angeles.

63
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,832
Kyle Singer, who was being
held by Salazar's people,

64
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:32,276
was not carrying the Cordilla virus
and is perfectly healthy.

65
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,716
But we do know Salazar's
organization has the virus,

66
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,837
which means finding Ramón Salazar
is our top priority.

67
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,911
Thank you for joining us, Gael.

68
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,673
If you're taking over for Michelle,
be on time.

69
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,751
- Sorry.
- From this moment on,

70
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:50,196
we are focused on one thing only.
Finding Ramón Salazar.

71
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,793
Adam, where are we on that?

72
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:56,351
After Jack and Ramón ditched the chopper,
we lost their trail. They could still be in LA.

73
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,273
Not for long.
We suspect they're heading for Mexico.

74
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,148
We've contacted the Mexican government
and the Central American allies.

75
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,437
- They're monitoring all air corridors.
- What about Chase?

76
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,438
- I assume he's coming here.
- Don't assume anything.

77
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,475
Ramón, have a drink. You're a free man.

78
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,558
Thank you.

79
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,435
Ramón...

80
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,396
Hello, Jack.

81
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:15,552
The party's going well.
I wanted you to know.

82
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:20,589
I want you to know something else.
For some reason, Hector wants you alive.

83
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:25,196
Maybe he wants to kill you himself.
Or maybe he wants to watch me do it.

84
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,512
- I'm just not sure I can wait that long.
- Ramón, let's get back to the party.

85
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,956
Come on. The girls. Sandra is waiting.

86
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:48,630
<i>- Yeah?
- This is Chappelle. What are you doing?</i>

87
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,473
- Trying to find Jack.
- So's the rest of CTU.

88
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,677
- Well, I may have a thread.
- Tell me.

89
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:58,116
Jack and I back-pocketed
some of Hector Salazar's contacts.

90
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,829
We'll pass any information on
to another field team. I want you here.

91
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:06,118
As soon as Jack hands Ramón Salazar
to his brother, they'll kill him.

92
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,351
- Jack may already be dead.
- I won't stop until I know for sure.

93
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,831
- Chase, I want you back here now.
- Why?

94
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,832
Because I just found out
Jack's been using heroin.

95
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:20,310
<i>And since you're his partner,
you must've known.</i>

96
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,515
- I had no idea.
- I don't believe you.

97
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,909
I believe you've been covering for him.

98
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,515
All that matters is finding Jack,
and I can't do that from CTU.

99
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,955
If you even want a chance
of keeping your job,

100
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,873
you'll get back here now
and debrief me on Bauer.

101
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,474
<i>- Do you understand?
- Yes, I understand.</i>

102
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,596
Good.

103
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,832
- O'Brian.
- Is Kim up there?

104
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,150
- No.
- Are your logs lagging by six hours?

105
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,231
Let me check.

106
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,276
- Yep.
- Kim was taking care of that.

107
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,636
I don't know what Kim's doing.
I don't follow her schedule.

108
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,272
Gael, are you going back
to Tech One right now?

109
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:08,239
- No, not right now. Why?
- I need something from Kim. I'll get her.

110
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,676
- No, she's not there.
- Yeah, she is. She's backing up logs.

111
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,958
Chappelle asked her to take a mirror drive
to Network. She'll be back soon.

112
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:20,238
- What do you need?
- What do I need? I need to find Jack.

113
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,233
We're dead-ending. Kim's his daughter.
Maybe she can help us.

114
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,676
As soon as she gets back,
I'll send her over, OK?

115
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,591
Yeah. OK.

116
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,154
Gael, I had Adam transfer
all my directories over to your system.

117
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,798
- Thanks. Great.
- Hold on.

118
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,678
I wanna go over the dispatches from Division.

119
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,558
There are 17 units in the field,
five of them downtown.

120
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,279
- They're trying to find Jack.
- And the other 12?

121
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:50,433
Health Services, LAX... Hold on.
Let me pull up the rest for you.

122
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:35,594
This is the matrix I use to balance resources.

123
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,750
I'll transfer it to you.

124
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:48,356
- Is Tony out of surgery?
- Yeah.

125
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,954
- Is he gonna be OK?
- Hope so.

126
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,596
<i>- Dessler.
- Is Gael with you?</i>

127
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:16,673
<i>- Yeah. Why?
- I can't get into Tech One. It's the code.</i>

128
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,671
Did you change the code to Tech One?

129
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,716
- No. Why?
- Adam can't get in.

130
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,109
- What does he need?
- What do you need, Adam?

131
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,112
- I'm looking for Kim. She was in there.
- Did you call her?

132
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:30,113
Something's wrong with the phone.
Can you override the door? It's tweaked.

133
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,873
Yeah, sure.

134
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,753
- What are you doing?
- Overriding the access code.

135
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:42,470
OK, I'm resetting it to 1-2-3-4.
It'll take 15 seconds to sync, though.

136
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,275
Thanks.

137
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,798
I'm sending everything related
to the virus to volume A.

138
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,996
Where do you want the Salazar file?

139
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,635
<i>Kim?</i>

140
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,790
Oh, my God. Kim!

141
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,790
- Kim?
- Adam, it was Gael.

142
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,795
<i> Section five is clear.</i>

143
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,758
I have a visual on the subject.
Section five.

144
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,711
Block him off on the other side!
Get down here! Come on!

145
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,439
I'm on it. I'm heading
down the stairwell now.

146
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,638
Section seven.
I'm locking down the corridor.

147
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:41,670
I do not have a visual on the subject.
Repeat, I do not have a visual. Please advise.

148
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,677
<i> We need backup!
Section seven!</i>

149
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,953
Put it down! Put it down!
Don't do it. Put it down now.

150
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,193
<i> Gael!</i>

151
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:15,829
- Don't get in my way!
- External security is in position.

152
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,196
You're not going anywhere.

153
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:25,515
You take one step outside,
you know exactly what will happen.

154
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:05,069
Yeah, OK, I will.

155
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,479
Thanks.

156
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,718
What did they say?

157
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:13,110
They haven't found Jack.
They're not sure if he's in the city.

158
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,714
He's not in the city.

159
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:20,112
His plan was to take Ramón Salazar
back to his brother to prevent the outbreak.

160
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,397
That's what he's gonna do,
even if it costs him his life.

161
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:27,109
That's probably true, but there's
nothing we can do about that now.

162
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:31,955
Our intelligence and military services
are working overtime on that front, so...

163
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,838
let them do their job.

164
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:38,071
We, unfortunately,
have other fires to put out.

165
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,274
Anne?

166
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,950
- I'm sorry about Ted and the debate.
- I don't wanna hear it. It's not your fault.

167
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,112
I told you to stand up to him,
but maybe I was wrong.

168
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:16,591
- Maybe you should've just paid him off.
- You were not wrong.

169
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,671
Mr President?

170
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,518
We have a lot of work to do.

171
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:45,193
I still can't believe Gael could be
a traitor. Has he said anything?

172
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:48,716
We haven't gone in yet.
We're sweating him first.

173
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:55,152
Listen, Ryan, Tony's out of surgery.
I wanna be there when he wakes up.

174
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,834
And I need you here.

175
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,595
We just uncovered a mole. We don't know
how badly we've been compromised.

176
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,912
But you're handling that. Anything
that spills over, you can give to Chloe.

177
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,472
- Chloe's a pain in the ass.
- She can do it. At least until I get back.

178
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:18,355
Fine. If you think you're dispensable.

179
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:21,113
I just wanna be with my husband.

180
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,193
All right.

181
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,316
Thank you.

182
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,670
All right, let's do this.

183
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,152
You had us, Gael.

184
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,549
Now we have you.

185
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:57,028
You workin' alone, or does Salazar
have other moles inside?

186
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:03,392
You know Johnson.
You know what Johnson does.

187
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,517
Sooner or later, you're going
to tell me what you know.

188
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:10,593
The only question is how hard
you wanna make this on yourself.

189
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:14,916
Kim says you were monitoring
the plane that had Jack Bauer on it.

190
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,549
- Is that true?
- I have nothing to say.

191
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:24,317
If it's the last thing you ever do, you're
going to tell me where that plane is landing.

192
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,593
What is it, Ramón? Don't you like the girls?

193
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,035
Tell me again why Hector wants Bauer alive.

194
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:19,795
- I don't know. He didn't say. But I...
- "But"?

195
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:24,032
But nothing. Every time Bauer
takes a breath is an insult to me.

196
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,554
I went to prison because of his betrayal.

197
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,952
I know, Ramón, and I'm sure
that Hector feels the same way.

198
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,679
- Then he won't mind.
- Ramón, no!

199
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,514
Are you giving me an order, Tomás?

200
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:45,630
Ramón, I work for you and your brother.
I love and respect both of you.

201
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:48,996
Hector instructed me to keep Bauer
alive until the plane lands.

202
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,674
And I'm instructing you to sit down.

203
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:57,073
Honor the one wish of your brother,
who arranged for your escape today.

204
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:02,393
In less than an hour, I am sure that
you will get your revenge on Bauer.

205
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,871
We'll see.

206
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,516
- Pour me another drink.
- Yes, Ramón.

207
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:31,795
- Pedro...
- I'm not supposed to talk to you, Jack.

208
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:35,475
Fine. Then listen. I risked my life
getting Ramón out of prison.

209
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:38,154
You put him in prison.

210
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,075
I need to tell Ramón
something important.

211
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,390
Before he gets wasted.
You know what he's like.

212
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,189
Yeah. Got drunk one time,
threw some guy off a plane.

213
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:52,068
Keeps going like this...
you might be landing before we do.

214
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,993
- For God's sakes, listen to me.
- No, you listen to me.

215
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:58,993
I'm not talking to you.
You're a dead man.

216
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,435
Jack...

217
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,033
Jack?

218
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,918
Quit screwing around, Jack.

219
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:09,150
We can explain the national security
issue that pulled you offstage,

220
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:13,916
but the allegation against Anne
will be a lot harder to handle.

221
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,788
Her ex-husband had an agenda.
It shouldn't be difficult to prove he's a liar.

222
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:21,031
This is dirty laundry,
and we know the public wants to hear it.

223
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,669
Unless you can offer them something
definitive, Anne will hurt you.

224
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,194
Gerry's right.

225
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,191
I'm your brother, I'm your advisor,

226
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:36,354
and I do have some perspective on this thing.
Now, do you wanna hear it?

227
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:39,034
Yes, I wanna hear it.

228
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,957
- Distance yourself from Anne.
- Wayne...

229
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:45,237
Before you shut me down, just hear me out.

230
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,515
You used up the public's goodwill
with Sherry.

231
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:52,639
They don't want you being involved
with someone else who's not trustworthy.

232
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,554
You have got to respect
the people who voted for you.

233
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:10,031
Oh, excuse me.

234
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:15,914
- Hello?
- Anne, it's me. Ted. We need to talk.

235
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:22,432
About what? What could you
possibly have to say to me?

236
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:25,876
I can't believe you even
have the audacity to call.

237
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,235
- I'm sorry.
- Well, that's great.

238
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:32,029
- Now everything's all right.
- I called because I wanna make it right.

239
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:35,510
How? How can you possibly
undo the damage you've done?

240
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,875
I'm in my office.
Come up and I'll explain.

241
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:41,157
- I'm not coming over there.
- Anne, listen to me.

242
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,913
<i>I have documents
that'll prove your innocence.</i>

243
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,276
- What kind of documents?
- Letters and memos.

244
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:52,593
Please. I wanna give them to you personally.
I promise I won't make a scene.

245
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:55,114
- I'll send someone over to get them.
- No!

246
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,671
No, we will do this my way,
or I swear I'll burn 'em right now.

247
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,876
All right. But you'd
better not be wasting my time.

248
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,676
Simon, we need to talk.

249
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:03,957
Chase Edmunds.
Sorry, but I'm having dinner right now.

250
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,719
- What do you want?
- Information.

251
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,631
- Are you crazy?
- What's going on?

252
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,474
Rita, take the kids upstairs.
Everything will be fine.

253
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:19,791
- What do you want?
- Ramón Salazar broke out of prison today.

254
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:24,351
- He's gonna hook up with his brother.
- I told you, I'm a legitimate accountant!

255
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:27,318
I don't have any business
with the Salazars.

256
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,119
Simon, I did not come here to bust you.

257
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:33,829
But I am not leaving
until I know where Hector is.

258
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:36,957
Do you understand me?

259
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,838
I don't know where Hector is now.

260
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:43,115
He left Colombia over two weeks ago.

261
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,237
- He didn't tell you where he was going?
- No.

262
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,152
- You're tied into his money flow, right?
- Yes, some of it.

263
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,310
Let's take a look.

264
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:45,028
Ramón... Hector is meeting us.

265
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,078
Just wait a few minutes.
Ramón, please. Hector said...

266
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:50,276
Are you ready to die, Jack?

267
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52,954
Back off! Back!

268
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:57,033
- Get back or I'll kill him! Get back!
- Shoot him, Tomás! Shoot him!

269
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:02,035
I die, he dies. Is that what you want
Hector to see when you get off this plane?

270
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,076
Drop the weapons!

271
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,796
There's no way out of this for you.

272
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,713
<i> He's right.
My brother has an army out there.</i>

273
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:16,271
- We're not in your back yard any more.
- I'll worry about that. You take a seat.

274
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,879
Ladies, don't worry.
Everything's under control.

275
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:22,918
The party will continue
once we're on the ground.

276
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,070
The big American hero.

277
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:31,270
What do you think, Jack?
That Hector's not prepared for you?

278
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,395
Shut up.

279
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:37,838
<i>Danny, OK. Hey, man, back up.
Rápido, rápido. Get in the car.</i>

280
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,229
Why do you need so many people?

281
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,232
I want to be prepared
when the plane lands.

282
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,880
- Prepared for what?
- Whatever.

283
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,918
I haven't heard from Gael.
He should've checked in.

284
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,152
- So call Ramón's plane.
- Too risky. The Americans are checking.

285
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,951
Come on!

286
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,833
I have to go, OK?

287
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,911
<i>Rápido! Come on!</i>

288
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:27,155
<i>Who else is working with you, Gael?</i>

289
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,470
Let me make something clear.

290
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:35,317
I would love nothing more than to hang you
as a traitor and watch you jerk till you're dead.

291
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,436
But I'm a realist.

292
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:42,719
If there are others, tell me now
and we might be able to cut you a deal.

293
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:52,429
Is that Hector?

294
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:02,508
Adam, bring me a tracking node now.
Now! Hector Salazar's calling!

295
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,591
Kim, grab that laptop.

296
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:21,038
- Put the socket in C5, Kim.
- Got it.

297
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,077
Hurry up.

298
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,109
OK, go.

299
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:33,637
One wrong word, I swear to God,
I'll make you regret it.

300
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,518
<i>- Hello?
- Where have you been?</i>

301
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,032
Busy. I don't have a lot of time.

302
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,588
- Where is Ramón?
- On his way to you.

303
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,956
- Is he safe?
- I think so.

304
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,519
What about Bauer?

305
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,988
- Don't know.
- What do you mean, you don't know?

306
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:56,868
- What are you doing there?
- They put me on something else.

307
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,034
They're watching me.

308
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,753
- Call me when you have something.
- Yeah.

309
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,514
Did we get it?

310
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,113
No.

311
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,553
Dammit.

312
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,157
Hey.

313
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,832
Hey.

314
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,391
How you doin'?

315
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,794
You scared the hell out of me.

316
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,440
I know. I'm sorry.

317
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:54,112
- How is he, Doctor?
- We couldn't have had a better result.

318
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:57,112
He'll be on his feet in a few days.

319
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,156
- When can he come home?
- Tomorrow.

320
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:03,677
I just wanna keep an eye on him,
make sure he stays stable.

321
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,513
Could we have a couple of minutes, please?

322
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,750
- Of course.
- Thanks.

323
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,638
- Michelle...
- Yeah?

324
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:20,712
Did the president let Salazar out of prison?

325
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:28,151
No. No, Jack broke him out so the president
wouldn't have to make the choice.

326
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,958
- Did he get away?
- Yeah.

327
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,437
I have to talk to Gael right away.

328
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,873
Wh...

329
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,916
- Gael?
- Yeah.

330
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:41,353
What, something happen to him?

331
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:45,796
- Gael's been working for the Salazars.
- How do you know that?

332
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:48,713
He was using Tech One
to monitor Salazar's escape.

333
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,518
When we found out, he tried to run.

334
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,795
- Where's he now?
- He's still at CTU.

335
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,713
Chappelle and Johnson
are questioning him.

336
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,870
- Where are you going?
- Get me over there.

337
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,838
- No, you're not going anywhere. Doctor!
- Get the car.

338
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:03,992
- Doctor!
- Mr Almeida, what are you doing?

339
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:07,038
I have to go.
You can release me to CTU Medical.

340
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,190
- I can't do that.
- All right, look.

341
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:14,230
If you're worried about liability,
my wife will sign me out.

342
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:20,395
Look, Michelle, if I ever needed you
to trust me, it's now.

343
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:24,835
These are the bank transfers
that he made from his account in Bogotá.

344
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,990
They stopped two weeks ago.

345
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:29,389
Follow the money. Where did it go?

346
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,276
Some of it to a bank account here in LA.
A Davíd Gomez?

347
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:37,238
Yeah, we already know about that.
What else?

348
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,517
- That's interesting.
- What?

349
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:46,720
$720,000 deposited.
I've never seen this account.

350
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,155
Where is it?

351
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:53,313
Banco del Oeste.
It's in a town in Mexico. Las Nieves.

352
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,311
OK, look out.

353
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:04,916
- That's gotta be it.
- Good. We're done?

354
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,718
- Not quite.
- What else?

355
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,234
- You have a private plane, don't you?
- Yes.

356
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:11,117
Clear it for takeoff.

357
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,476
- Hey, Kim.
- Hey, Chloe.

358
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:22,393
Did he hurt you? Gael, I mean.

359
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,232
No.

360
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,790
It's crazy. He's been here two years,
and the CIA five before that.

361
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:31,668
- How did he end up a terrorist?
- I don't know, Chloe.

362
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:38,554
Listen. I wanna tell you that
I don't think your dad's a bad person.

363
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,677
If I've ever said anything
to offend you, I'm sorry.

364
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,876
It's OK. Thanks.

365
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:46,428
There, I said it.

366
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,871
- Hello?
- It's me. Are you alone?

367
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,911
Hold on.

368
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:04,115
Where are you?
Chappelle ordered you back.

369
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:07,033
I'm not coming back
until I find your father.

370
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:10,430
<i>- How are you gonna do that?
- I found out where Hector Salazar is.</i>

371
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:13,910
Town in Mexico called Las Nieves.
Jack's taking Ramón there.

372
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,356
No, Chase, it's the other way around.
Ramón's taking my dad.

373
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,477
- How do you know that?
- There was a video feed.

374
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:24,519
And I saw it. They knocked my dad out
and dragged him onto a plane.

375
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,636
A video feed? I don't understand.

376
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:31,718
Gael works for the Salazars. He's been
watching through surveillance cameras.

377
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:35,554
- Gael?
- He was helping the Salazars the whole time.

378
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,756
- Is Gael talking?
- I don't know.

379
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:41,992
Chappelle's got him now. But I don't
know if they're getting anywhere.

380
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,550
CTU has been compromised.
Do not tell anyone you've talked to me.

381
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,631
- Even Chappelle?
- Especially not him.

382
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:50,792
You cannot go in there alone.
Hector will have an army.

383
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:55,715
I will call for backup. I need you to promise
me you won't tell anyone you talked to me.

384
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:59,713
- I don't know.
- Don't do this to us. Too much is at stake.

385
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:04,316
I'm not doing anything to us.
This is about your life. And my dad's.

386
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:09,315
I know what this is about. I have to go dark.
There's no time to argue about it. Just do this.

387
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:15,752
<i>- Kim?
- Be careful, Chase.</i>

388
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:18,115
Kim? Kim!

389
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,589
So tell me, tough guy. What's the plan?

390
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,710
- You'll know soon enough.
- Come on.

391
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:36,270
<i>We're interested. Tell the girls. </i>

392
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:40,717
Do you think you're going to
land the plane and arrest Hector?

393
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:45,828
No. Even the great Jack Bauer
can't take 50 men by himself.

394
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:50,391
Oh, I got it. You're gonna drop me off,
turn the plane around.

395
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:55,508
But wait. You are a criminal in America.
Wanted. So where will you go?

396
00:34:56,880 --> 00:35:00,839
I don't think a third-world country
will suit you.

397
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:03,388
I think that's called a dilemma, Jack.

398
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,118
Shut up.

399
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:15,310
Adam...

400
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,755
- Where's Chappelle?
- He's with Gael.

401
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:21,469
- Where?
- Interrogation 820.

402
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,551
Let's go.

403
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,430
What the hell's going on?

404
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,431
I don't know.

405
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,995
Talk to me, you son of a bitch.

406
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,233
Door.

407
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,278
- Enough.
- What are you doing?

408
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,396
- Ryan, get him out of the room.
- Why?

409
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:47,314
Trust me, Ryan.
Get him out of the room.

410
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,950
- You too, Ryan.
- What?

411
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,600
I gotta talk to Gael by myself.
Just trust me.

412
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,069
Michelle, what's going on?

413
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:02,115
I don't care what's going on
between you two.

414
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:06,113
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm staying right here.

415
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,991
Ramón?

416
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,234
Ramón!

417
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:57,196
- Where is Ramón?
- Hector...

418
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,836
Where's my brother?

419
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:04,991
Kill him! Kill Bauer! Do you hear me?

420
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:11,750
- What are you doing, Jack?
- He tried to kill me on the plane!

421
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,910
Why the guns?
This is not what we talked about!

422
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:21,235
I was worried. Gael wasn't
sure you were on the plane.

423
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:24,679
Go see your brother.

424
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,909
My brother, I'm so glad to see you.

425
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:35,835
- What's going on? I don't understand.
- I'll tell you in a minute. I promise.

426
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:48,189
Good job, Jack.

427
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:03,117
Come. We have a lot of work to do.

428
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,430
What are you doing, Hector?

429
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:13,149
Come. I'll explain everything.

430
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,634
- He's in.
- What? Who's in?

431
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,233
- Jack.
- What?

432
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:57,233
Gael and I have been trying to get Jack
back undercover with the Salazars.

433
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:59,629
- That signal means he's in.
- I don't understand.

434
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:03,395
I'll explain everything.
Right now we gotta call the president.
