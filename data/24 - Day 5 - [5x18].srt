1
00:00:14,123 --> 00:00:15,637
Evelyn, I need you to stay focused.

2
00:00:15,723 --> 00:00:18,922
The recording of the call
between Logan and Henderson

3
00:00:19,005 --> 00:00:21,200
is in a safety deposit box. Which bank?

4
00:00:21,286 --> 00:00:23,437
City Trust and Savings in Agoura Hills.

5
00:00:23,527 --> 00:00:27,441
Jack knows there's no point
going public until he has proof.

6
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:30,441
None of this should have happened. This
thing was planned to make our country safer.

7
00:00:30,529 --> 00:00:34,204
And it all spiralled out of control
when you decided to kill David Palmer.

8
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:37,601
We have to focus on stopping Bauer
before he finds that recording.

9
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:43,286
Karen, I'm issuing an executive order for the
immediate apprehension and arrest of Bauer.

10
00:00:43,373 --> 00:00:46,969
I want you to run point on this,
and make it CTU's top priority.

11
00:00:47,054 --> 00:00:48,488
Understood, sir.

12
00:00:49,015 --> 00:00:50,573
If we really want to find Bauer,

13
00:00:50,656 --> 00:00:53,729
we need to keep watch on
anyone he might contact for help,

14
00:00:53,817 --> 00:00:55,489
starting with Audrey Raines.

15
00:00:55,577 --> 00:00:58,138
Don't fill your father in on the particulars.
Just set up the meeting.

16
00:00:58,218 --> 00:00:59,857
<i>I'll call back when I have the recording.</i>

17
00:00:59,939 --> 00:01:01,452
<i>I need to see you in person.</i>

18
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:04,418
Can you reroute your plane to Los Angeles?

19
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,378
<i>- All right, yes.
- I'll see you there.</i>

20
00:01:06,901 --> 00:01:10,612
Jack. Are you aware Logan's
issued a warrant for your arrest?

21
00:01:10,703 --> 00:01:12,694
<i>The vice president's not behind this, is he?</i>

22
00:01:12,784 --> 00:01:14,182
No, it's Logan.

23
00:01:14,264 --> 00:01:19,544
When we have the evidence,
we'll give it to the Secretary of Defense.

24
00:01:19,626 --> 00:01:22,903
<i>- It had to be done.
- I decide what needs to be done.</i>

25
00:01:22,986 --> 00:01:24,978
<i>I never authorised you to kill David Palmer.</i>

26
00:01:25,067 --> 00:01:26,023
We got what we need.

27
00:01:26,107 --> 00:01:30,261
The instant that Bauer
steps outside that bank, you take him down,

28
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:33,023
kill the others and get the recording.

29
00:01:49,155 --> 00:01:50,066
We got the evidence.

30
00:01:50,156 --> 00:01:52,955
<i>- Have you listened to it?
- Yeah, there's no doubt it's Logan.</i>

31
00:01:53,037 --> 00:01:56,667
We're talking about taking down
the President of the United States.

32
00:02:03,281 --> 00:02:07,399
<i>This checkpoint is just one of many
that have been in place for several hours now.</i>

33
00:02:07,482 --> 00:02:11,556
<i>Despite his announcement that Los Angeles
is no longer under threat of attack,</i>

34
00:02:11,644 --> 00:02:15,843
<i>President Logan has ordered
that martial law remain in effect.</i>

35
00:02:15,924 --> 00:02:19,475
<i>While the move has drawn criticism
from civil rights advocates,</i>

36
00:02:19,566 --> 00:02:22,957
<i>the president is defending his decision
as a necessary precaution.</i>

37
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,681
<i>- Yes.
- It's me.</i>

38
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:36,487
- Is Bauer dead?
- Not yet, Mr. President.

39
00:02:36,572 --> 00:02:39,723
- You said your men had him.
- Bauer triggered the bank alarm.

40
00:02:39,813 --> 00:02:44,444
Authorities came before my men could get
to him. Bauer used the fire fight to slip away.

41
00:02:44,535 --> 00:02:46,685
- He has the recording?
- Yes, sir.

42
00:02:46,776 --> 00:02:51,292
That evidence directly implicates me
in David Palmer's death.

43
00:02:51,377 --> 00:02:55,451
If it gets to someone who can do something
about it. We'll have Bauer before that.

44
00:02:55,539 --> 00:02:59,134
- How?
- You have established control over CTU.

45
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,609
CTU is heading up the search effort for Bauer.

46
00:03:01,701 --> 00:03:03,771
You put a lot of faith in their ability.

47
00:03:03,861 --> 00:03:06,979
This city is locked down. CTU will find Bauer.

48
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:12,661
And when they do, make sure you're
the first to know so my men can intercept.

49
00:03:25,668 --> 00:03:29,060
<i>- Yes, Mr. President?
- Get me Karen Hayes at CTU.</i>

50
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:32,427
We're sifting satellite and Caltrans video
for Audrey's vehicle.

51
00:03:32,511 --> 00:03:35,788
I've distributed her photo
to checkpoints throughout the city.

52
00:03:35,872 --> 00:03:39,070
If she used her DOD credentials,
there should be a record.

53
00:03:39,153 --> 00:03:42,989
I hope we're not wasting our resources.
We don't know she's helping Bauer.

54
00:03:43,074 --> 00:03:46,704
She dumped the tracker. There's a reason
she doesn't want to be followed.

55
00:03:46,796 --> 00:03:50,949
<i>Ms Hayes,
the president is on line one.</i>

56
00:03:51,037 --> 00:03:53,188
- Yes, Mr. President?
- Where are we, Ms Hayes?

57
00:03:53,278 --> 00:03:56,316
Still running active manhunts
on both Bauer and Henderson.

58
00:03:56,399 --> 00:03:59,039
- I told you to prioritise Bauer.
- I have, sir.

59
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,316
I've allocated my resources accordingly.

60
00:04:01,401 --> 00:04:04,200
If Palmer's killer is free
when the news cycle begins,

61
00:04:04,282 --> 00:04:08,276
then all the success we've had
handling these terrorists will be undermined.

62
00:04:08,363 --> 00:04:10,195
I will find Bauer, sir.

63
00:04:10,284 --> 00:04:12,354
You let me know the moment you do.

64
00:04:12,444 --> 00:04:14,436
Yes, Mr. President.

65
00:04:15,006 --> 00:04:17,281
Bauer, right?

66
00:04:17,366 --> 00:04:22,044
Raines knows where he is. Those protocols
aren't gonna be enough to track her.

67
00:04:22,128 --> 00:04:25,678
- Chloe helped her break surveillance?
- I'm sure of it.

68
00:04:25,769 --> 00:04:29,810
Remember, Audrey insisted
Chloe be assigned to her.

69
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:35,091
- Then we need to confront Chloe.
- No, no, no, no, no. She'll just deny it.

70
00:04:35,173 --> 00:04:37,926
There's a way we can use her to find Bauer.

71
00:04:47,056 --> 00:04:50,892
It's all right, it's him.
Bill! Over here.

72
00:04:50,977 --> 00:04:52,297
Jack.

73
00:04:53,738 --> 00:04:56,811
Bill Buchanan. Wayne Palmer.

74
00:04:56,899 --> 00:04:59,972
I'm sorry about your brother.
What the hell's going on, Jack?

75
00:05:00,061 --> 00:05:03,816
Every law enforcement agency across
this country has a warrant for my arrest.

76
00:05:03,902 --> 00:05:06,701
- What for?
- Killing David Palmer.

77
00:05:06,783 --> 00:05:08,775
We cleared you this morning.

78
00:05:08,864 --> 00:05:11,743
I'm being set up again.
This time by President Logan.

79
00:05:11,824 --> 00:05:14,703
He was complicit
in David Palmer's assassination.

80
00:05:17,387 --> 00:05:21,301
- My God, you're serious.
- Logan's trying to stop me exposing him.

81
00:05:21,388 --> 00:05:26,417
We have the evidence. A digital recording of a
conversation between Logan and Henderson.

82
00:05:26,509 --> 00:05:29,662
Secretary Heller will take it
to the attorney general.

83
00:05:29,751 --> 00:05:32,585
They'll file for the warrant,
but I think Wayne's a target.

84
00:05:32,671 --> 00:05:36,109
- I need you to take him somewhere safe.
- Of course I will.

85
00:05:36,193 --> 00:05:40,233
- Where you gonna meet Heller?
- Van Nuys airport.

86
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,599
- Yeah?
- Jack. My father landed. Where are you?

87
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,833
I dropped Wayne off with Buchanan.
I'm on my way to the airport.

88
00:06:00,922 --> 00:06:05,155
All right. I'm on the north side
of the emergency runway at hangar, uh, 112.

89
00:06:05,243 --> 00:06:07,473
- I'll be there in a few minutes.
- Hurry.

90
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:55,859
Dad.

91
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:59,540
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hi.

92
00:07:00,022 --> 00:07:02,014
Thank you so much for doing this.

93
00:07:02,103 --> 00:07:05,460
Well, I don't know what it is I'm doing,
so don't thank me yet.

94
00:07:05,544 --> 00:07:08,378
These men in your security detail,
do you trust them?

95
00:07:08,464 --> 00:07:12,425
- With my life.
- I need to be sure that they are loyal to you.

96
00:07:12,506 --> 00:07:15,624
What's going on?

97
00:07:18,788 --> 00:07:22,179
Dad, I will tell you but only you.

98
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:24,261
Stay here.

99
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:29,944
You know I don't like to be kept in the dark.
Tell me what this is all about.

100
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:33,946
I promise I will. I just need a minute.

101
00:07:34,433 --> 00:07:37,312
- Mr. Secretary.
- What the hell are you doing here?

102
00:07:37,394 --> 00:07:41,674
He's a fugitive. Every law enforcement
agency in the state is looking for him.

103
00:07:41,756 --> 00:07:44,476
- He's innocent.
- Then why don't you turn yourself in?

104
00:07:44,557 --> 00:07:48,950
I swear to you, I had nothing to do
with David Palmer's assassination.

105
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:52,236
I'd like to believe you,
but you're acting like a criminal.

106
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,994
I don't have a choice. They're setting me up.

107
00:07:55,081 --> 00:07:57,994
Mr. Secretary,
I only need you for a few minutes.

108
00:07:58,082 --> 00:08:00,676
I need to show you something, but privately.

109
00:08:00,762 --> 00:08:02,880
Inside the building. Please.

110
00:08:07,645 --> 00:08:09,841
Thank you, sir.

111
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:28,568
<i>- It had to be done.
- I decide what needs to be done.</i>

112
00:08:28,652 --> 00:08:31,645
<i>I never authorised you to kill David Palmer.</i>

113
00:08:31,733 --> 00:08:35,329
- President Logan?
- And a man named Christopher Henderson.

114
00:08:35,415 --> 00:08:39,489
<i>- For God's sake, sir, he called your wife.
- I can handle my wife.</i>

115
00:08:39,575 --> 00:08:43,206
<i>My concern is stopping this operation
collapsing like a house of cards.</i>

116
00:08:43,297 --> 00:08:46,415
<i>All threads end with Cummings.</i>

117
00:08:46,498 --> 00:08:49,252
<i>He thinks he's running this.
Keep playing it that way.</i>

118
00:08:49,339 --> 00:08:53,936
<i>I know my part, Mr. Henderson.
You just do as you're told.</i>

119
00:08:56,502 --> 00:08:59,699
Logan supplied the terrorists
with the Sentox nerve gas.

120
00:08:59,783 --> 00:09:03,174
- What?
- He planned to deploy it en route to Moscow.

121
00:09:03,264 --> 00:09:05,733
He could use the terrorists as an excuse

122
00:09:05,825 --> 00:09:10,104
to invoke the military terms of the agreement
that he made earlier with Suvarov.

123
00:09:10,186 --> 00:09:13,463
This was all to gain control
of the oil supply in Central Asia.

124
00:09:13,548 --> 00:09:17,178
David Palmer found out about it,
and that's why they killed him.

125
00:09:17,269 --> 00:09:19,578
How do you know
that hasn't been fabricated?

126
00:09:19,669 --> 00:09:25,349
I trust the source. Mr. Secretary, I promise
you, this will stand up under scrutiny.

127
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:29,267
I wish I could say I was surprised, but I'm not.

128
00:09:29,352 --> 00:09:33,905
I watched Charles Logan
rise on the tide of his own ambition.

129
00:09:33,995 --> 00:09:36,874
I was terrified when he took the oath.

130
00:09:36,955 --> 00:09:40,585
I'm sorry I had to involve you,
but I needed someone who had access

131
00:09:40,677 --> 00:09:43,111
to hand-deliver this to the attorney general.

132
00:09:43,198 --> 00:09:47,670
- So you contacted me.
- You're the only one I can trust.

133
00:09:56,322 --> 00:09:58,473
All right, then.

134
00:09:58,563 --> 00:10:00,998
Thank you, sir.

135
00:10:01,924 --> 00:10:05,520
Go with your father. He'll need someone
to corroborate the evidence.

136
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:10,806
- What about you?
- I'm gonna go dark. I'll let Buchanan know.

137
00:10:10,887 --> 00:10:14,563
All right.
Jack, everything's gonna be OK now.

138
00:10:14,648 --> 00:10:16,844
- Go.
- OK.

139
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:23,532
- Jack, one more thing.
- What, sir?

140
00:10:25,652 --> 00:10:28,167
- Dad, what are you doing?!
- Secure my daughter.

141
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:32,133
You're playing a dangerous game here, Jack,
and you're playing it wrong.

142
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:36,494
Turning Logan's crime into a public spectacle
will not bring back David Palmer.

143
00:10:36,576 --> 00:10:42,574
It'll tear this nation apart.
You'll be destroying the presidency.

144
00:10:42,938 --> 00:10:46,898
The collateral damage of the truth
will cripple this nation.

145
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:49,733
So what are you gonna do?
Bury the evidence?

146
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:52,574
No. You're coming with me, Audrey.

147
00:10:52,661 --> 00:10:57,019
We'll use the evidence
to get Logan to step down quietly.

148
00:10:57,103 --> 00:11:00,380
Once he's gone,
we'll have a chance to set things right again.

149
00:11:00,463 --> 00:11:05,745
Doug, I'm trusting you to keep this item safe.
She's coming with me.

150
00:11:05,825 --> 00:11:08,102
Dad, I can't.

151
00:11:08,186 --> 00:11:12,818
- Secure them both until you hear from me.
- Dad, please, no!

152
00:11:12,908 --> 00:11:16,539
Mr. Secretary! You can't make a deal with him!

153
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:19,620
You can't trust him!

154
00:11:36,868 --> 00:11:39,064
What's going on in the situation room?

155
00:11:39,149 --> 00:11:40,947
- It's a briefing.
- No one told me.

156
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:44,820
- It's a class three.
- I'm a department head. I should be in there.

157
00:11:44,911 --> 00:11:47,187
It's all I know.

158
00:11:50,153 --> 00:11:53,669
- Shari, what was that briefing about?
- Just a protocol review.

159
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:55,188
- I don't believe you.
- Why not?

160
00:11:55,275 --> 00:11:59,428
Cos you're a bad liar. Miles just gave me
a bunch of busy work to do to keep me out.

161
00:11:59,516 --> 00:12:02,271
Do you think
there might be a reason he kept you out?

162
00:12:02,357 --> 00:12:04,918
He thinks I helped Audrey
break her surveillance.

163
00:12:04,998 --> 00:12:08,788
- Is that what it was about?
- I've already said too much.

164
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:13,112
Come on, Shari. You owe me.
I stuck my neck out for you with Miles.

165
00:12:13,201 --> 00:12:15,636
Tell me what happened in there.

166
00:12:17,003 --> 00:12:20,360
Miles found Audrey.
He activated a transponder on her car.

167
00:12:20,443 --> 00:12:24,836
- So they know where she is?
- We're running an operational support now.

168
00:12:24,925 --> 00:12:28,363
That's what the briefing was about.
They sent a tac team ten minutes ago.

169
00:12:28,446 --> 00:12:31,519
Please don't tell anyone I said anything.

170
00:12:33,248 --> 00:12:35,967
Here she comes.

171
00:12:48,533 --> 00:12:52,368
Damn, she's good.
She set up a proprietary comm channel.

172
00:12:52,454 --> 00:12:54,970
- How long will it take to trace her call?
- Not long.

173
00:12:55,055 --> 00:12:57,729
Pick up.

174
00:13:01,897 --> 00:13:06,212
Somewhere in the valley.
Looks like a payphone.

175
00:13:06,299 --> 00:13:09,053
I've got the receiving end
at a one-mile radius.

176
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:11,211
Why isn't Audrey picking up?

177
00:13:11,301 --> 00:13:13,691
Narrowing. Got it!

178
00:13:13,782 --> 00:13:16,695
- Where?
- Van Nuys airport.

179
00:13:16,783 --> 00:13:21,461
The emergency runway.
Adjacent to the main field.

180
00:13:21,544 --> 00:13:26,301
Move the tac team out now. Van Nuys airport.
Miles is forwarding the coordinates.

181
00:13:26,386 --> 00:13:28,741
<i>- Operations.
- Get me the president.</i>

182
00:13:45,392 --> 00:13:48,545
You said they sent the tac team
ten minutes ago.

183
00:13:51,074 --> 00:13:54,385
- Miles set me up, and you helped.
- You're working against us.

184
00:13:54,475 --> 00:13:56,706
- You've no idea what you've done.
- Miles...

185
00:13:56,796 --> 00:14:01,349
Miles is an idiot. You should know that.
I can't believe you went along with him.

186
00:14:01,438 --> 00:14:03,827
- Please come with us.
- Where we going?

187
00:14:03,918 --> 00:14:05,910
Let's go.

188
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:12,911
We still don't have confirmation that
Audrey Raines and Bauer are at the location.

189
00:14:13,002 --> 00:14:16,234
We'll find out.
I'll have the military authority follow up on it.

190
00:14:16,323 --> 00:14:19,600
The military?
Sir, I just dispatched my tac team.

191
00:14:19,684 --> 00:14:21,720
- Call them back.
- I don't understand.

192
00:14:21,805 --> 00:14:25,845
Jack Bauer is a very sensitive problem.
There are political ramifications.

193
00:14:25,926 --> 00:14:28,805
I've decided to handle him directly.

194
00:14:28,887 --> 00:14:33,167
Besides, you must have your hands full
transitioning CTU to Homeland Security.

195
00:14:34,569 --> 00:14:37,722
- I'll recall my team, sir.
- Good.

196
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:41,931
The president wants oversight
on the Bauer operation.

197
00:14:42,012 --> 00:14:46,245
He's the president. He can do what he wants.

198
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:49,293
Yeah.

199
00:14:49,374 --> 00:14:51,935
- CTU thinks they've found Bauer.
- Where?

200
00:15:00,178 --> 00:15:03,330
Jack, what if my father's right?

201
00:15:03,419 --> 00:15:06,776
What if he can get Logan
to step down quietly?

202
00:15:06,861 --> 00:15:10,171
These people
brokered chemical weapons to terrorists.

203
00:15:10,262 --> 00:15:14,495
They've killed an ex-president of the United
States. Logan's not gonna make a deal.

204
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:17,576
If he did, he wouldn't keep it.
Henderson wouldn't let him.

205
00:15:17,664 --> 00:15:20,179
Your father is making himself a target.

206
00:15:20,265 --> 00:15:26,137
You wanna help him, help me get the
recording back before he speaks to Logan.

207
00:15:26,226 --> 00:15:31,701
Look, Mike, if the president wants Jack Bauer,
why doesn't he let us take care of it?

208
00:15:31,789 --> 00:15:34,986
I've been on other things.
Let me find out what's going on.

209
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:37,266
- I'll get back to you.
- Thank you, Mike.

210
00:15:39,151 --> 00:15:41,620
<i>...will be lifted within the next two hours.</i>

211
00:15:41,713 --> 00:15:44,864
<i>But the curfew will remain in effect...</i>

212
00:15:50,315 --> 00:15:52,591
Come in.

213
00:15:52,676 --> 00:15:55,794
Oh, Mike.
That's only six hours from now.

214
00:15:55,877 --> 00:15:58,711
OK. Right.

215
00:15:58,798 --> 00:16:01,358
David Palmer's body's
being flown back to DC at 7am.

216
00:16:01,439 --> 00:16:04,273
The president will be there
when the coffin's put on the plane.

217
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:07,080
- That's a good idea.
- Yeah.

218
00:16:07,161 --> 00:16:12,998
- What's up, Mike?
- I just got a call from Karen Hayes at CTU.

219
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:18,557
Do you know about the president's decision
to pull them off the acquisition of Bauer?

220
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:22,685
- No. But what's the problem?
- It doesn't really make any sense.

221
00:16:22,766 --> 00:16:26,396
Karen's teams are closer,
they can do it more efficiently.

222
00:16:26,487 --> 00:16:32,485
Bauer's more likely to cooperate with them
than with a group of military police.

223
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:35,605
Karen has barely got CTU back on its feet.

224
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:40,812
I'm sure the president just feels more
confident with the military units in place.

225
00:16:40,892 --> 00:16:46,810
- Well, the military has its hands full, Hal.
- What do you want me to say, Mike?

226
00:16:46,895 --> 00:16:51,412
It's the president's call. I can see it both ways.

227
00:16:54,417 --> 00:16:56,214
Thanks.

228
00:16:56,298 --> 00:16:57,731
Yeah.

229
00:17:05,821 --> 00:17:09,735
<i>- DOD Operations.
- Put me through to General Warren, please.</i>

230
00:17:09,822 --> 00:17:11,700
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

231
00:17:21,906 --> 00:17:25,503
<i>- This is Warren.
- Mike Novick on the line for you.</i>

232
00:17:25,588 --> 00:17:29,343
<i>- Go ahead, Beth.
- You're connected.</i>

233
00:17:29,429 --> 00:17:30,419
What is it, Mike?

234
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:34,663
General, can you give me an update
on your search for Jack Bauer?

235
00:17:34,751 --> 00:17:37,425
- What?
- The one the president ordered.

236
00:17:37,512 --> 00:17:40,869
We never received
such a call from the president.

237
00:17:40,953 --> 00:17:43,673
I see. I'm sorry to disturb you, General.

238
00:17:43,754 --> 00:17:45,745
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

239
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:07,633
- You should try to get some rest.
- Yes, I know. I should try to get some rest.

240
00:18:12,964 --> 00:18:15,479
What is it you want, Mike?

241
00:18:15,564 --> 00:18:20,435
I just got off the phone with General Warren
who's running military operations here.

242
00:18:20,526 --> 00:18:21,960
Why?

243
00:18:22,047 --> 00:18:26,486
Karen Hayes over at Homeland raised
a few good points I thought I'd follow up on.

244
00:18:26,568 --> 00:18:28,958
What good points, Mike?

245
00:18:29,049 --> 00:18:32,930
She doesn't understand why
she was taken out of this Bauer situation.

246
00:18:33,011 --> 00:18:36,641
I really don't care
what Karen Hayes understands.

247
00:18:36,732 --> 00:18:41,854
She should be doing her job and not
asking questions that diminish my authority.

248
00:18:43,614 --> 00:18:46,448
Be that as it may, I did follow up, and, uh...

249
00:18:46,536 --> 00:18:51,247
now, frankly,
I'm a little mystified by some things.

250
00:18:51,337 --> 00:18:53,852
What things mystify you, Mike?

251
00:18:53,938 --> 00:18:58,490
Well, you told Homeland that you wanted
the military to pick up Jack Bauer,

252
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:03,656
but I just spoke with General Warren
and he's unaware of any such directive.

253
00:19:03,741 --> 00:19:07,053
Because I didn't go through General Warren.

254
00:19:07,142 --> 00:19:10,533
May I ask who you did go through?

255
00:19:10,623 --> 00:19:13,378
Mike, let's get one thing straight.

256
00:19:13,464 --> 00:19:15,934
I don't answer to you.

257
00:19:16,026 --> 00:19:18,415
Of course not, sir.

258
00:19:22,188 --> 00:19:27,422
However, I will tell you this. I have decided to
use a covert task force to bring in Jack Bauer.

259
00:19:27,509 --> 00:19:32,949
The reason I am doing that is because
Bauer presents special circumstances.

260
00:19:33,031 --> 00:19:38,505
- "Special circumstances"?
- I want this completely off the radar, Mike.

261
00:19:39,994 --> 00:19:42,589
The Chinese government
believe Bauer is dead.

262
00:19:42,674 --> 00:19:47,147
If they find out he's alive, they're
going to blame us, they're going to accuse us

263
00:19:47,236 --> 00:19:50,786
of fabricating the story of his death.

264
00:19:50,878 --> 00:19:55,031
Wouldn't we be keeping the circle smaller
if we let Karen handle this?

265
00:19:55,119 --> 00:20:01,469
Her people already know about Bauer.
They're working under a secretive mandate.

266
00:20:01,561 --> 00:20:05,271
You know what, Mike?
I am tired of being second-guessed.

267
00:20:05,362 --> 00:20:09,642
I've been dealing with wall-to-wall crises
for the last 18 hours,

268
00:20:09,723 --> 00:20:12,956
and I think I've done a damn good job
of leading the country.

269
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:15,605
Of course, Mr. President.

270
00:20:17,846 --> 00:20:20,919
You came in here
suggesting that I should get some rest.

271
00:20:21,008 --> 00:20:26,289
That's the one recommendation of yours
that I intend to take.

272
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:30,123
Thank you, Mike.

273
00:21:00,821 --> 00:21:03,973
We traced your call
to a public phone at Van Nuys airport.

274
00:21:04,062 --> 00:21:07,100
If Audrey is at that location,
you're in a lot of trouble.

275
00:21:07,184 --> 00:21:11,098
This situation is complicated.
You have no idea what you're dealing with.

276
00:21:11,184 --> 00:21:12,698
- But you do?
- Yes.

277
00:21:12,786 --> 00:21:16,665
- Then why didn't you tell me?
- Because I can't.

278
00:21:18,347 --> 00:21:22,388
You think the rules don't apply to you
because you're smarter than the rest of us.

279
00:21:22,468 --> 00:21:26,065
They do. And you're not.

280
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:29,029
I won't miss you when you're gone.

281
00:21:30,071 --> 00:21:32,461
Miles.

282
00:21:33,352 --> 00:21:35,583
Don't touch me.

283
00:21:36,993 --> 00:21:40,829
- What?
- Jack Bauer did not kill President Palmer.

284
00:21:40,915 --> 00:21:44,829
He's a federal fugitive wanted
for the murder of a former president.

285
00:21:44,917 --> 00:21:47,556
Which means you're going to jail, O'Brian.

286
00:21:47,637 --> 00:21:50,232
For a long time.

287
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:56,632
Miles. I don't think you're as big of a jerk
as you pretend to be.

288
00:21:58,401 --> 00:22:00,962
- I need to speak with you.
- Yes, sir.

289
00:22:09,364 --> 00:22:12,164
has anyone
spoken to her in Holding?

290
00:22:12,245 --> 00:22:15,000
- No, sir.
Has anyone tried to speak to her?

291
00:22:15,087 --> 00:22:17,921
No, sir.
O'Brian has been disloyal to CTU.

292
00:22:18,007 --> 00:22:21,763
She has been working with Bauer,
and I don't think I need to remind you,

293
00:22:21,848 --> 00:22:25,320
Karen Hayes and I regard her as a top priority.

294
00:22:35,413 --> 00:22:39,533
What are you doing, Chloe?
You're supposed to be in custody.

295
00:22:39,615 --> 00:22:43,291
- Miles let me out.
- You're a worse liar than I am.

296
00:22:43,777 --> 00:22:45,733
Shari, don't do that.

297
00:22:45,817 --> 00:22:50,255
- You helped Audrey break surveillance.
- For a good reason. I can't get into it now.

298
00:22:50,339 --> 00:22:54,127
I don't really think you have a choice.

299
00:22:54,219 --> 00:22:58,055
Listen to me for a minute.
Jack Bauer did not kill President Palmer.

300
00:22:58,141 --> 00:23:02,056
He knows who did it. He may need my help
to prove it, and I can't if I'm in custody.

301
00:23:02,143 --> 00:23:09,415
- Then why don't you just tell Karen?
- She won't believe me. Not without evidence.

302
00:23:10,465 --> 00:23:14,460
- It's President Logan.
- What are you talking about?

303
00:23:14,547 --> 00:23:19,498
The evidence Jack is trying to get implicates
Logan in the assassination of Palmer.

304
00:23:19,589 --> 00:23:21,068
That's ridiculous.

305
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:25,190
You know your sexual harassment charges
against Miles? I know you were lying.

306
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:31,303
You need help. If you try to stop me, I will
recommend you for psychiatric evaluation.

307
00:23:31,393 --> 00:23:34,032
You won't like that, trust me.

308
00:23:48,838 --> 00:23:50,557
Charles.

309
00:23:50,639 --> 00:23:53,234
Are you coming to bed soon?

310
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,199
- I doubt if I'll get much sleep tonight.
- You should try.

311
00:23:58,282 --> 00:24:00,034
Yeah.

312
00:24:00,122 --> 00:24:03,354
- You OK?
- I'm fine. It's just, uh...

313
00:24:04,684 --> 00:24:07,153
It's been a challenging day.

314
00:24:10,246 --> 00:24:12,886
- Come to bed.
- I will.

315
00:24:12,967 --> 00:24:14,082
Soon.

316
00:24:19,169 --> 00:24:21,444
<i>- Yes.
- Sorry to disturb you.</i>

317
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:24,284
<i>Secretary Heller insists on talking to you.</i>

318
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:30,243
<i>- Tell him I'll call him back tomorrow.
- He says it's urgent, sir.</i>

319
00:24:30,333 --> 00:24:32,370
Put him through.

320
00:24:34,374 --> 00:24:37,048
- Yes, James?
- Thanks for taking my call.

321
00:24:37,135 --> 00:24:40,287
- You said it was urgent.
- I need to see you, sir.

322
00:24:40,376 --> 00:24:43,608
- See me about what?
- I'd rather speak to you in person.

323
00:24:43,698 --> 00:24:46,656
Fine. But I won't be back to Washington
for a couple of days.

324
00:24:46,738 --> 00:24:50,414
- I'm in LA, sir. I need to see you tonight.
- Tonight?

325
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,172
<i>- Yes, sir.
- What is this about?</i>

326
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:54,821
I'll be there shortly
and we can discuss it then.

327
00:24:54,901 --> 00:24:59,613
I don't like your tone, James. You're
addressing the President of the United States.

328
00:24:59,703 --> 00:25:05,575
I know who I'm addressing. And I think
you know exactly what this is about.

329
00:25:05,664 --> 00:25:08,021
<i>- When will you be here?
- Five minutes.</i>

330
00:25:08,106 --> 00:25:10,541
Fine.

331
00:25:10,626 --> 00:25:13,016
James Heller? What does he want?

332
00:25:15,268 --> 00:25:19,821
He's getting flak from the joint chiefs
about my decision to maintain martial law.

333
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:24,268
You would think that these people
would show some allegiance.

334
00:25:24,351 --> 00:25:28,551
- Can't James handle it himself?
- Apparently not.

335
00:25:31,714 --> 00:25:35,230
- Come to bed when you're done.
- I will.

336
00:25:53,441 --> 00:25:54,761
Yeah.

337
00:25:54,842 --> 00:25:57,072
<i>- Where are you?
- We're leaving now.</i>

338
00:25:57,162 --> 00:25:59,199
- How long will it take?
- Ten minutes.

339
00:25:59,283 --> 00:26:03,403
We may not have that much time.
James Heller is on his way here to see me.

340
00:26:03,484 --> 00:26:06,602
- Jack got to him.
- What if Bauer's given him the recording?

341
00:26:06,686 --> 00:26:11,842
Heller's not stupid enough to carry it with
him. Without it, what he knows won't matter.

342
00:26:11,928 --> 00:26:13,998
- Think Bauer still has it?
- I'm sure of it.

343
00:26:14,088 --> 00:26:18,845
I'll hold Heller off as long as I can. Phone me
the second you have the evidence in hand.

344
00:26:18,929 --> 00:26:20,080
Right.

345
00:27:13,629 --> 00:27:15,904
Mrs. Logan.

346
00:27:25,713 --> 00:27:28,466
- What is Secretary Heller doing here?
- I don't know.

347
00:27:28,554 --> 00:27:31,022
But you have an idea.

348
00:27:32,235 --> 00:27:35,194
My husband says it's about
his order to maintain martial law,

349
00:27:35,276 --> 00:27:38,269
but I think it's something else.

350
00:27:39,797 --> 00:27:43,108
If you know what it is,
would you please tell me?

351
00:27:43,198 --> 00:27:46,316
- I can't.
- You can't?

352
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:49,393
Or you won't?

353
00:27:49,481 --> 00:27:53,111
Please don't ask me
anything more, Mrs. Logan.

354
00:27:57,323 --> 00:27:59,998
Whatever you tell me
will remain between us,

355
00:28:00,084 --> 00:28:03,361
I promise you.

356
00:28:04,045 --> 00:28:06,515
Aaron,

357
00:28:06,607 --> 00:28:10,362
you can trust me, you know that.

358
00:28:14,089 --> 00:28:17,003
Not here.

359
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:20,208
- Just meet me in a couple of minutes.
- Where?

360
00:28:20,291 --> 00:28:23,807
Outside the south stable.

361
00:28:33,176 --> 00:28:35,644
James.

362
00:28:35,736 --> 00:28:38,046
Thank you, gentlemen.

363
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:51,495
- I hope this was important.
- I know what you did and what you're doing.

364
00:28:51,582 --> 00:28:54,256
And I'm here to put an end to it.

365
00:28:54,343 --> 00:29:00,341
- You'll have to be a little more specific.
- You are responsible for Palmer's murder.

366
00:29:02,385 --> 00:29:05,026
- That's outrageous.
- I heard a recording.

367
00:29:05,106 --> 00:29:09,499
A conversation between you
and a man named Christopher Henderson.

368
00:29:09,588 --> 00:29:13,503
When Palmer found out about your
insane plan, Henderson had him killed.

369
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:16,549
And you let it happen.

370
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:18,781
- Where is this recording?
- In a safe place.

371
00:29:18,871 --> 00:29:22,581
- I would like to hear it.
- Why? You know exactly what you said.

372
00:29:22,672 --> 00:29:25,188
And so do I.

373
00:29:25,273 --> 00:29:28,505
It's burnt into my memory.

374
00:29:30,555 --> 00:29:33,468
How dare you stand there and judge me.

375
00:29:33,556 --> 00:29:35,991
You have no idea.

376
00:29:36,077 --> 00:29:40,197
Until you sit in my chair, you don't know
what the hell you're talking about.

377
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:44,353
- Your chair is not a throne.
- I'm protecting the interests of our country.

378
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,635
- You mean oil.
- Yes. Yes!

379
00:29:46,721 --> 00:29:51,477
This country needs energy, more than you or
anybody in this government cares to admit.

380
00:29:51,563 --> 00:29:55,352
We'll see how you judge me when
the cost of oil goes up over $100 a barrel,

381
00:29:55,443 --> 00:29:59,518
and the people who put me in office
can't heat their homes, or run their cars.

382
00:29:59,605 --> 00:30:03,281
And you think that justifies
the blood on your hands?

383
00:30:16,891 --> 00:30:22,889
- What do you want?
- Drop the trumped-up charges against Bauer.

384
00:30:22,973 --> 00:30:25,408
And leave my daughter alone.

385
00:30:27,014 --> 00:30:32,136
- Anything else?
- Announce your resignation by morning.

386
00:30:32,216 --> 00:30:37,338
Blame it on the crushing stress of today's
events. Blame it on whatever you want.

387
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:42,210
Just as long as you go public
by the start of the morning news cycle.

388
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:46,295
- And then what?
- The recording will be kept safe.

389
00:30:46,381 --> 00:30:48,896
This will remain between us.

390
00:30:51,263 --> 00:30:57,454
Call in Gardner. I want to be here
when you hand him your letter of resignation.

391
00:31:26,075 --> 00:31:28,271
Get in here.

392
00:31:29,315 --> 00:31:32,035
- I couldn't contact Jack or Audrey.
- I haven't either.

393
00:31:32,117 --> 00:31:35,155
CTU might have them in custody.
Where's your work station?

394
00:31:35,238 --> 00:31:38,390
This way.
Homeland changed my access code.

395
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:41,040
I can create a workaround.

396
00:31:42,721 --> 00:31:45,235
If CTU has Jack, it's all my fault.

397
00:32:34,618 --> 00:32:37,656
I can get us outta here.

398
00:32:43,501 --> 00:32:45,696
Watch the door.

399
00:33:40,321 --> 00:33:42,277
Jack.

400
00:33:45,882 --> 00:33:48,761
He's got restraints in his pockets. Secure him.

401
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:10,680
Wachsler, status report.

402
00:34:11,771 --> 00:34:14,081
Mark, come in.

403
00:34:19,414 --> 00:34:21,929
Don't move! Don't... move.

404
00:34:22,015 --> 00:34:25,770
Slowly - put the gun on the ground
and kick it towards me.

405
00:34:25,856 --> 00:34:27,848
Do it!

406
00:34:31,498 --> 00:34:34,297
Put your hands where I can see 'em.

407
00:34:39,021 --> 00:34:42,810
Give me the recording. Slowly.

408
00:34:47,423 --> 00:34:49,494
Stand up.

409
00:34:49,584 --> 00:34:53,055
- What did you do to my partner?
- He's fine.

410
00:34:53,946 --> 00:34:58,065
Son of a bitch.
Take cover behind the wheel, now. Move!

411
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:11,180
- What's going on?
- They want the recording.

412
00:35:11,272 --> 00:35:16,189
If you and I are gonna get through this alive,
we need to work together.

413
00:35:18,394 --> 00:35:20,386
Gimme my gun.

414
00:35:25,837 --> 00:35:27,953
Go!

415
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:47,396
Go! Move in!

416
00:35:49,044 --> 00:35:50,603
Take cover!

417
00:35:52,085 --> 00:35:53,917
Aagh!

418
00:36:15,813 --> 00:36:17,452
Audrey!

419
00:36:18,255 --> 00:36:22,010
I have her, Jack. And don't make me kill her.

420
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:26,488
There's been too much killing today already,
so just throw out that recording.

421
00:36:26,577 --> 00:36:31,015
- Let her go, Christopher.
- After I have the recording.

422
00:36:31,099 --> 00:36:33,567
Why are you protecting Logan?

423
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:37,017
I'm protecting something
more important than Logan.

424
00:36:37,101 --> 00:36:39,935
What?
- The integrity of our government.

425
00:36:40,022 --> 00:36:42,138
Our government has no integrity.

426
00:36:42,223 --> 00:36:47,583
Not when someone like Charles Logan
occupies the presidency.

427
00:36:47,664 --> 00:36:50,305
You can make this right.
You can help me stop him.

428
00:36:50,385 --> 00:36:54,061
Sorry, Jack. Now, throw me the recording.

429
00:36:57,068 --> 00:37:00,379
I'll give you the recording
if you let Audrey go.

430
00:37:00,469 --> 00:37:04,463
- I wish I could believe that.
- I give you my word.

431
00:37:08,111 --> 00:37:11,947
I'll tell you what -
I'll meet you halfway.

432
00:37:12,033 --> 00:37:14,946
What does that mean?

433
00:37:15,034 --> 00:37:17,833
- Get out.
Audrey.

434
00:37:22,037 --> 00:37:24,835
- Dammit, Christopher!
- Here she comes, Jack.

435
00:37:24,918 --> 00:37:28,069
Just walk out slowly or I'll kill you.

436
00:37:29,639 --> 00:37:31,835
Audrey.

437
00:37:42,643 --> 00:37:45,204
That's far enough.
- What have you done?

438
00:37:45,284 --> 00:37:47,401
The left brachial artery.

439
00:37:47,485 --> 00:37:53,164
She has about three minutes before she
bleeds to death. Throw me that recording.

440
00:37:53,247 --> 00:37:55,283
Jack, don't...

441
00:37:55,928 --> 00:37:59,922
She's 15 seconds closer to dying, Jack.
Gimme the recording!

442
00:38:00,009 --> 00:38:02,649
Jack, don't do it.

443
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:05,564
She's running out of time!

444
00:38:06,651 --> 00:38:08,244
Jack...

445
00:38:08,332 --> 00:38:13,203
- Don't do it, Jack. Don't. Don't give it to him.
- Here it is!

446
00:38:29,219 --> 00:38:31,131
Easy. Easy. Easy.

447
00:38:31,219 --> 00:38:33,415
Easy. Stay with me. Stay with me.

448
00:38:33,501 --> 00:38:37,131
- Jack, go get it. Go get the recording.
- Stay with me.

449
00:38:38,622 --> 00:38:41,343
I'll be right back.

450
00:38:50,346 --> 00:38:52,542
Gimme your arm.

451
00:39:05,632 --> 00:39:07,863
I need to move you.

452
00:39:07,953 --> 00:39:09,511
Come on.

453
00:39:12,754 --> 00:39:15,144
All it needs is your signature, Mr. President.

454
00:39:15,235 --> 00:39:18,194
James, we can find another way
to handle this.

455
00:39:18,275 --> 00:39:20,871
There must be something that you want.

456
00:39:20,957 --> 00:39:24,030
You're giving me exactly what I want.

457
00:39:25,598 --> 00:39:28,398
You asked to see me, Mr. President?

458
00:39:28,479 --> 00:39:32,234
Hi, Jim. Thought you'd be
on a plane back to Washington.

459
00:39:32,321 --> 00:39:37,636
- What are you doing here?
- I'll let President Logan tell you.

460
00:39:40,003 --> 00:39:42,199
Mr. President.

461
00:39:48,486 --> 00:39:50,876
Hal, I...

462
00:39:54,928 --> 00:39:57,888
- Yes?
- I have the recording.

463
00:39:57,969 --> 00:40:02,089
- Really?
- I'll call you back after I've secured a vehicle.

464
00:40:02,171 --> 00:40:04,163
Thank you.

465
00:40:11,254 --> 00:40:16,489
Hal, I'm asking Secretary Heller to tender his
resignation. I wanted you here as a witness.

466
00:40:16,576 --> 00:40:20,651
- What?
- He thinks I was complicit in today's attacks.

467
00:40:20,737 --> 00:40:23,206
I don't know how he can accuse me
without evidence.

468
00:40:23,299 --> 00:40:28,738
He orchestrated a conspiracy
to let terrorists acquire stolen nerve gas.

469
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:30,698
That's insane.

470
00:40:30,781 --> 00:40:36,494
He sanctioned the assassination
of David Palmer, and I have the evidence.

471
00:40:36,583 --> 00:40:39,018
Where? Show it to us.

472
00:40:46,066 --> 00:40:49,457
Who was on the phone? Who made that call?

473
00:40:51,508 --> 00:40:53,783
I want your resignation by the morning.

474
00:40:53,869 --> 00:40:57,988
- If any harm comes to my daughter...
- Gentlemen!

475
00:40:58,070 --> 00:41:02,463
Please escort Secretary Heller
out of my home.

476
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:26,315
This is gonna hurt.

477
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,631
Aagh!
