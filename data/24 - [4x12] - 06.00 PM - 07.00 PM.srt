1
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,991
Five power plants are ready to melt down.

2
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,469
All I care about is making sure
that doesn't happen.

3
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,439
Your name is on a lease on a building in
Chatsworth that was used to plan the attack.

4
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:26,718
- That makes you a prime suspect.
I don't know about that building.

5
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,597
I don't believe you.

6
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:34,635
Jack, please don't.

7
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:38,952
I don't know the specific building
you're talking about. I can find out.

8
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,029
How?

9
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,714
My corporate records
are stored on my laptop.

10
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,677
Here it is. It's Harris Barnes.

11
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:49,039
Interpol traced the name and listed
foreign nationals who have used it.

12
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,635
- Who used it most recently?
- A man named Habib Marwan.

13
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,359
- We need to find him.
- I think we have.

14
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,999
You OK?
- Yeah.

15
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:05,470
I overheard a phone conversation.
We have less than 15 minutes.

16
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:10,588
Have your men secure the floor.
Curtis and I are going after the override.

17
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,712
Stay down!

18
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,870
Stay down.

19
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,951
Marwan is impersonating a CTU officer.

20
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,271
<i>I repeat, the suspect</i>
<i>is impersonating a CTU officer. </i>

21
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,155
Edgar! Line one.
Curtis has the override.

22
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,356
- <i> The override logged in?</i>
- Yes.

23
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:35,238
<i>Good. Send it to channel 11. Hurry up. </i>

24
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,236
They're starting to respond.

25
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,595
- It's working, Edgar.
- Yes! Yes!

26
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,069
The temperature is dropping
in all remaining power plants.

27
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,513
Congratulations, Edgar.

28
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:54,398
<i> Ms Driscoll? It's about Maya. </i>
<i>You'd better go down to the clinic right away. </i>

29
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,038
Maya?

30
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,589
Oh! Oh!

31
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,991
Oh, baby!

32
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,511
No!

33
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,277
- <i> I got new intel. </i>
- What?

34
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:27,036
<i>The man you're looking for,</i>
<i>Habib Marwan, works for McLennan-Forster. </i>

35
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,270
But they made the override.

36
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,070
He's working under the alias Harris Barnes.
They had no reason to suspect.

37
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,312
He positioned himself inside the company
so he could use their technology.

38
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,597
Tell 'em to freeze Marwan's personal files.

39
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,353
I did. You want me
to send a comm team over?

40
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,796
- No, we're closer. Jack or I'll go.
- <i>Sure. </i>

41
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,553
Marwan was in the building
within the last 15 minutes.

42
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,712
I want perimeters here,
roadblocks in every direction.

43
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,155
- Done.
- Jack. I just got off with CTU.

44
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:00,119
Marwan worked for McLennan-Forster
under an alias, Harris Barnes.

45
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,191
- I told CTU we'd check it out.
- OK.

46
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,831
Take Paul and Audrey back to CTU.
I'll be on my cell. Castle'll stay in charge here.

47
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,434
If he's in the area,
our teams will pick him up.

48
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,398
- Curtis will take you back to CTU.
- What about you?

49
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,597
- I have to go to McLennan-Forster.
- Why there?

50
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,433
Turns out the man
we're looking for works there.

51
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,239
- Need to get into their computer system?
- Yeah.

52
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,356
OK. I'll go with you.

53
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,749
- Why?
- My company sold them their IT system.

54
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,196
I designed the database.
It's encoded with military security.

55
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,477
McLennan-Forster has personnel
that can get into his files.

56
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,918
Yeah, well, I can get you in back doors
those people don't even know about.

57
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,711
Fine. You go with me.

58
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,473
Audrey, I want you to stay with Curtis.

59
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,359
I'll be on my cell.
Let's go.

60
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,991
Stop.

61
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,911
Goodbye, baby girl.

62
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:00,036
OK. I'll let everyone here know.

63
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,597
Yeah, thanks, Nat.

64
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,793
Let everyone know what?

65
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,917
Driscoll's daughter
committed suicide in our clinic.

66
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,912
- How did she do that?
- She slit her wrists.

67
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,471
- Doesn't make sense. She was watched.
- I don't know, Edgar. I wasn't there.

68
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,189
I was just thinking out loud.
You don't have to be so hostile.

69
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,350
Excuse me, Mr Secretary.

70
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,711
Where's Driscoll?
The president's about to come on.

71
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,555
- Something terrible just happened, sir.
- What's that?

72
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:50,156
Ms Driscoll's daughter Maya committed
suicide in our clinic 15 minutes ago.

73
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,028
Apparently the doctor walked in and she...

74
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,031
Erin.

75
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,908
Sarah just told me. I am so sorry.

76
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,354
Thank you, sir.

77
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,512
- Go back to the floor, Sarah.
- Yes, ma'am.

78
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,955
Erin, you do not need to be here.

79
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,957
Where should I be, sir?
We're still in crisis mode.

80
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:18,034
Habib Marwan is still out there, and we've no
idea how many other cells he might activate.

81
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,635
- For God's sake, Erin...
- Our systems are in a transition state

82
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,156
that require my constant attention.

83
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:30,433
I'm not in denial about
my daughter's death, nor am I in shock.

84
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:34,399
I can perform my duties until
you find a suitable replacement for me.

85
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,677
<i> Ms Driscoll?</i>
<i>The president's coming on now. </i>

86
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,637
Thank you, William.

87
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,231
Jim? Erin?

88
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:49,875
<i>First, I want to express my deep gratitude</i>
<i>for what you've accomplished so far today. </i>

89
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:54,511
<i>Wresting back control of the override</i>
<i>has saved thousands of American lives. </i>

90
00:06:54,600 --> 00:07:00,152
<i>And the latest NRC report is that the San</i>
<i>Gabriel Island meltdown is under control. </i>

91
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,152
That's great news.
But has your staff informed you

92
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,674
that we still have a few
problems to deal with?

93
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,830
Yes, and that's why I'm calling you.

94
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:11,117
<i>The man responsible</i>
<i>for today's attack is still at large. </i>

95
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,431
Yes, sir, he is. His name is Habib Marwan.

96
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:18,433
He's been a long-term employee
of a major defence contractor.

97
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,715
<i>Yes, I heard. McLennan-Forster. </i>

98
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,151
This Habib Marwan...

99
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:27,711
Do you believe melting down the reactors
was his endgame, or something else?

100
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:31,076
As long as he's out there,
we have to assume it's not over.

101
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:34,596
<i>Erin, exactly where are we</i>
<i>on apprehending this man?</i>

102
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:38,116
All our resources are being
deployed to that end right now.

103
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,636
<i>I'll have more information</i>
<i>once I've been briefed by my staff. </i>

104
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:45,030
<i>But we know Marwan's in Los Angeles,</i>
<i>and we will find him. </i>

105
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:19,913
As Harris Barnes, Marwan worked at
McLennan-Forster for two years as engineer.

106
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,675
His most recent project
was design and development of the override.

107
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,638
- Before that?
- Here's the timeline we pieced together.

108
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,998
He went to graduate school in England,
worked for a company outside London.

109
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:34,311
It's not clear whether
he was radicalised there or before.

110
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,870
The one thing we know is that
from the day he arrived in the US,

111
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,633
everything he did was about today.

112
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,711
What were his other duties?

113
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,792
We don't know yet.
We're taking a first pass at his records.

114
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:50,670
I'm looking into the possibility that he used
McLennan-Forster to recruit sleeper cells.

115
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:55,595
That brings up another issue. We have over
80<i>%</i>/ of field personnel looking for Marwan.

116
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:01,596
I'm just wondering if we shouldn't divert
part of that to try to root out these other cells.

117
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,874
- Erin?
- I'm sorry. What was the question?

118
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:11,953
Do you think we should
reduce the field load on Marwan?

119
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:21,672
How about we take some people off Marwan,
but still keep a floor of 60<i>%</i>/ looking for him?

120
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,035
Would that work?

121
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,953
Yes. That would work.

122
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,031
OK.

123
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,392
- I want you to relocate personnel.
- Based on what?

124
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,358
People who've come in
the last six hours work on Marwan.

125
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:46,479
- I want alert people on him.
- Are we gonna ignore what just happened?

126
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,710
What do you mean?
- Erin.

127
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,030
She shouldn't be running this place.

128
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,793
Her daughter died a few minutes ago.
Give her time.

129
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:57,077
Time? Edgar, since when
did we have the luxury of time?

130
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,833
- She knows what's at stake here.
- You're right.

131
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:04,357
We don't have time. We have work to do.
It does not include deciding Erin's fate.

132
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:09,230
- I think we have to tell Secretary Heller.
- No, we don't. Not yet. Let's get back on it.

133
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:30,630
- <i> Hey. Where are you?</i>
- Curtis and I just arrived at CTU.

134
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,508
Listen, get a security detail,
go back to the hotel and get some rest.

135
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,160
Jack, I can't leave.
My father needs my help.

136
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:40,391
- Are you at McLennan-Forster yet?
- Almost.

137
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,630
Jack, can you make me a promise?

138
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,473
- What?
- Take care of Paul.

139
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,199
He's not like you.

140
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:55,951
Please, Jack, promise me
that you will look after him.

141
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,394
- Yeah, I will.
- Thank you.

142
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:04,469
- Yeah, OK. I'll talk to you later.
- All right. Bye.

143
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,991
Look, uh...

144
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,834
I don't resent you.

145
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:21,992
Well, I wouldn't blame you if you did.

146
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,990
No, uh...

147
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:31,108
You didn't steal my wife.
We were separated. That's fair.

148
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,398
But I'm not gonna let you take her from me.

149
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,392
I don't think that's really up to you.

150
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,550
- Or me.
- No, maybe it isn't.

151
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:45,634
But she still has feelings for me,
I can hear it in her voice.

152
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,029
I'll fight to keep those feelings alive.

153
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:52,910
Well, Paul, you're gonna
have to do what you gotta do.

154
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:10,111
None of our field agents at the Rockland
building have picked up a thread on Marwan.

155
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,191
It looks like he might have escaped.

156
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:16,353
So I think we have to assume
he's going to activate these sleeper cells.

157
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,910
I agree. He'll most likely
launch a strike right away,

158
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,595
create fear that we're still vulnerable.

159
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,559
You'll have to excuse me,
I'm not feeling very well.

160
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,517
Erin!

161
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,511
Sit down. You all right?

162
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:39,750
- <i> Clinic. </i>
- Get me medical. Erin needs assistance.

163
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:43,071
No, I'm fine. I don't need anybody.

164
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:49,758
I just got a little
light-headed for a second there.

165
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,117
- Ms Driscoll...
- I don't need you here.

166
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,509
I was dizzy, but... I feel better.

167
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,752
Take a break. Get something to eat.
Take Ms Driscoll and get her some food.

168
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:03,230
I can handle the situation here
while you rest. Come on.

169
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:06,915
All right. It's probably a good idea.

170
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:19,236
She's gonna need to be relieved of duty.

171
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:27,678
Contact Division. Alert them to the situation
and tell them to send someone.

172
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,354
I ran this office for two years.

173
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:34,513
I could take over for Erin
on a provisional basis.

174
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:38,479
Forget for the moment
that you technically don't even work here.

175
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,394
You've been away a while.
You're not fluent with the new systems.

176
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,519
With all due respect, sir,
you don't need a programmer.

177
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,592
You need a decision maker
who can stack up protocols.

178
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,955
And you can do that?

179
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,315
Yes, sir. I can.

180
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,472
Fine. Effective immediately,

181
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:02,759
you're the interim director
of CTU Los Angeles under my authority.

182
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:10,279
I still want to contact District, have them
send someone on a more permanent basis.

183
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,920
I understand, sir.

184
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:22,233
Do you have the abstract
on McLennan-Forster?

185
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,517
One second. I'm finishing it now.

186
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:32,356
All right. McLennan-Forster was a principal
contractor in the design of the override.

187
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:36,433
And Marwan, under the alias of Harris Barnes,

188
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:40,274
had full security access on that project.

189
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,715
You ran FBI checks on the others involved?

190
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,473
Yes. They came up clean.

191
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:49,838
We're dealing with a terrorist who had
inside access to a defence contractor.

192
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:54,710
Actually, more than that. McLennan-Forster,
in addition to weapons manufacture,

193
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,678
trains their clients to use those weapons.

194
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,910
- International clients?
- Yes.

195
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,549
Several countries in the Balkans,
Asia, and the Middle East.

196
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:06,837
This is a messy situation.
When Jack gets to McLennan-Forster,

197
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:10,754
he has to get into company records
and find out who Marwan dealt with.

198
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,149
It's not gonna be that easy.

199
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:17,677
This reflects on them. They'll be reluctant
to give incriminating information.

200
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,230
Even if Marwan were the only guilty party.

201
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:30,116
Mr McLennan,
we need to talk before CTU gets here.

202
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,112
- What's the problem?
- It was more than a coincidence

203
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:39,070
that one of our products, the override, was
stolen and used in today's terrorist attack.

204
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:42,277
What do you mean,
"more than a coincidence"?

205
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:46,114
The entire operation,
from Secretary Heller's kidnapping

206
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:52,673
to the meltdown of San Gabriel Island,
was organised by one of our own employees.

207
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,158
- What are you talking about?
- One of our engineers,

208
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:03,190
who we now know is a terrorist named Habib
Marwan, was running a covert organisation

209
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:06,511
- from within our company.
- When did you find this out?

210
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:10,673
Couple of minutes ago they called.
One of our employees, Harris Barnes,

211
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:13,035
was actually Habib Marwan.

212
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:21,357
- Who else knows about this?
- Just the two of us. And Conlon.

213
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,549
Gentlemen. I'm David Conlon,
VP of internal security.

214
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:28,074
Jack Bauer, with CTU.
This is Paul Raines.

215
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,754
Jack, Paul. How can I help you?

216
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,956
I need to speak with Gene McLennan.

217
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,510
Gene's in a meeting right now,
and he asked me to assist you.

218
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:40,275
- I have access to everything.
- My office didn't make itself clear.

219
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:45,354
This is a matter of national security.
I need to speak with Mr McLennan now.

220
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,512
I understand. Let me see what I can do.

221
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:59,555
- What's the matter?
- Something's not right.

222
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:06,470
John, I'm not gonna keep this a secret. We
have to let the government know right away.

223
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,516
Sir! If you do this,

224
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:12,878
it will, with 100<i>%</i>/ certainty,
be the end of this company.

225
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:16,873
Now, you built McLennan-Forster.
Everything you have is tied up in it.

226
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:21,875
If this comes out, you'll be synonymous
with what happened. Terrorism. Treason.

227
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,633
What do you want me to do?
Lie to the government?

228
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:29,350
If I knew 24 hours ago what I know now, I'd
have done whatever it took to stop the attack.

229
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,149
But there's nothing we can do now.
Except protect ourselves.

230
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:38,394
And keep this company from going under, as
it will if CTU find out the truth about Marwan.

231
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,234
John, CTU will subpoena the file.
They will find out the truth.

232
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,357
No, they won't, Gene. I promise you.

233
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,113
Conlon and I can deal with this.

234
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,111
If you let us.

235
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,273
I don't like the sound of this.

236
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:00,239
Mr McLennan, we implicitly
violated national security procedure.

237
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:05,394
This could mean prison time.
We've got to protect ourselves.

238
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:12,435
- Did you get the latest casualty figures?
- No, not yet.

239
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:16,069
Which version of the Datalink
security system are you running?

240
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,479
Excuse me?

241
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:21,439
My company produces firmware
for Datalink. We installed your system.

242
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,273
Are you at 3.4 or 3.5?

243
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,749
Uh, 3.5. Does that work for you?

244
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,115
Yeah. Thanks.

245
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:37,354
Dave. Come on in.
John Reiss, chief technology officer.

246
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,079
You helped us identify the override.
Jack Bauer.

247
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,594
- It's good to meet you.
- I'm Gene McLennan.

248
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,750
I'm, uh, sorry I was delayed.

249
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:48,594
- Well, thank you for your time, sir.
- So how can I help CTU?

250
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:52,195
One of your employees,
Harris Barnes, is actually Habib Marwan,

251
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:56,034
a terrorist responsible for today's
attack and theft of the override.

252
00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:02,309
We need you to take your IT systems offline
so Paul can look into his directory.

253
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,914
We can do that. Can't we, John?

254
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,116
Absolutely. Uh, follow me.

255
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:14,150
Thank you, sir.
Certainly.

256
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,510
Maybe you should go home.

257
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:06,108
I'm afraid to.

258
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,952
When my wife, Susan, died,
I didn't deal with it at all.

259
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:19,555
Actually, I went to work the next day.

260
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:23,189
I remember thinking to myself, "That's life. "

261
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:28,229
"Quit feeling sorry for yourself,
get over it and get on with it. "

262
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:32,669
A few weeks later I answered
a call from an old friend of Susan's

263
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,149
who did not know she had died.

264
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,114
And when I heard myself saying:

265
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:45,349
"Susan has passed away",

266
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,353
when I actually said those words,

267
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,749
it hit me.

268
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:56,516
All the pain I was trying
to shut out just overwhelmed me.

269
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,994
Erin, you can't keep it inside.

270
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:09,477
You cry, you blame God, you blame yourself,
and then you cry some more.

271
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,233
And all the while
you let your friends help you.

272
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,311
It's pretty simple.

273
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,828
But very painful.

274
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,912
And I am so, so sorry for you.

275
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,355
Dad, I just wanted... Oh.

276
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,795
Um... Uh, I'm sorry. I...

277
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,871
I just wanted to let you know that I was back.

278
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,710
I will go home.

279
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,679
You should go
and make sure your daughter's OK.

280
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:52,196
If you need me, I'll be on the floor.

281
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,190
Excuse me, sir. Tony just told me
you put him in charge of CTU?

282
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,157
That's correct.

283
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:10,153
That doesn't make sense. He just got
reinstated, I'm second in command.

284
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,198
Tony had Erin's job.
He has experience running CTU.

285
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,316
- You don't.
- With all due respect...

286
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,949
Relax, Curtis. It's provisional,
till District finds someone.

287
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,270
For the record, I don't like it.

288
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:27,595
- What do you hear from Bauer?
- He just arrived at McLennan-Forster.

289
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,716
He'll call if he picks up any threads.

290
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,639
OK, that was Marwan's
work station in the corner.

291
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,632
His computer is tied
into the engineering subnet.

292
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:45,679
What about the rest of the network?
Can we get into it from his account?

293
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,832
Yeah, I think there's a way to do that.

294
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:08,553
One window shows you his system files,
the other gets you outside the subnet.

295
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,073
Thanks.

296
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:13,038
Let me know if you need anything.

297
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,111
Thanks for your help.

298
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:25,877
This guy looks like
he knows his way around our system.

299
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:30,988
Don't worry. I'll be able to control things
from here. He won't find a thing.

300
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:34,029
Marwan purged a lot of files.

301
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,192
- When?
- Deletion dates aren't coming up.

302
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:41,556
That means they could
have been deleted today.

303
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:45,349
Marwan wasn't here today.
He was at Rockland, with the override.

304
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,637
Maybe someone else deleted the files.

305
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,435
There.

306
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,909
All right. Let me see what I can find.

307
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:02,190
- Yeah?
- I had to open up a socket for him.

308
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:05,477
- I can see it.
- Are they gonna be able to find anything?

309
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:10,918
As long as I can stay ahead of him, I should
be able to delete the incriminating files.

310
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,070
All right. I'm coming up.

311
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:16,197
What if you can't stay ahead of him?
What happens then?

312
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,794
- There are other options.
- What options?

313
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,633
We'll set off an EMP.

314
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,712
A pulse bomb?
Are you out of your mind?

315
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,710
It'll destroy every piece of hardware we have.
It'll cripple us electronically.

316
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,791
That's the point.

317
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,198
This is the handover sequence for comm.

318
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:54,113
I left the default password in place.

319
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:58,990
- You can reset it as soon as we're done here.
- All right.

320
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:02,675
Here are all the access codes
to CTU and Division.

321
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:08,914
- Thanks.
- If any of my personal stuff gets in your way,

322
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,719
have someone box them
and put them into storage.

323
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,552
All right.

324
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,991
If you need anything, ask Curtis.

325
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:38,316
And if he can't help you,
you can always call me at home.

326
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,992
Thanks.

327
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:27,039
Could I have
everybody's attention, please?

328
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,556
By now, you know that
I've taken over Erin Driscoll's command,

329
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,631
on a purely provisional basis.

330
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,711
All protocols remain the same.

331
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:38,793
But I want updates from
all department heads every 15 minutes.

332
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:43,112
Other than that, I'm just here to support you.

333
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,191
So let's get back to work.

334
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:50,990
- Hear from Jack?
- They're looking through Marwan's files.

335
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:53,275
- Any promising leads?
- Nothing yet.

336
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:59,993
Right. Look, Edgar, before Erin left she told
me the one person I should rely on is you.

337
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,554
- She said that?
- Yes, she did.

338
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:09,111
So anything you think is important,
I want you to bring it to me directly. Right?

339
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,668
- You got it.
- All right. Thanks.

340
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:18,309
Have you scanned satellite imagery
around the Rockland building?

341
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,870
- Everything since the override takedown.
- All right.

342
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,838
I want you to try
different frequency channels.

343
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:28,196
- Manually?
- Yeah. Only way we can be sure to see it all.

344
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:32,319
I'll have to talk to Tony.
I'm supposed to be backing up Jack and Paul.

345
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,119
Put somebody else on that.
This is more important.

346
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,270
What's more important?

347
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:40,079
We've got 75<i>%</i>/ of our people
on McLennan-Forster.

348
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:44,836
- I need Edgar to find a thread on Marwan.
- No, we don't have much chance by satellite.

349
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:48,356
Our best chance is through those files.
Stay on that.

350
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:54,072
- We can't afford one security-grade analyst?
- One, but not Edgar. Put somebody else on it.

351
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,957
Tony.

352
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:01,351
Are we trying to accomplish the same thing?
Or is this you establishing position?

353
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,750
I don't have to establish position.
I've already got it.

354
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:08,992
Now, what do you say we stop
wasting time arm-wrestling here?

355
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:13,949
I respect your opinion. But we'll disagree,
and when we do, we're gonna do it my way.

356
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:17,635
Fine. But I suggest you put manpower
into a data search for Marwan.

357
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:22,589
All right. Grab a couple people from image
processing. Work the satellites with them.

358
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,671
Curtis.

359
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,470
Don't worry. I'm gonna be
out of here when this crisis is over.

360
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,915
In the meantime,
I want the same thing you do.

361
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,436
I want to find Habib Marwan. All right?

362
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:09,832
Is everything all right?
I heard you had a problem.

363
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:15,358
CTU got to the override before
the other nuclear plants melted down.

364
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,635
Well, at least you're safe.

365
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:23,636
For now. But they know who I am. They'll
be tracking me with everything they've got.

366
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:27,713
- How does that affect our scheduling?
- It doesn't. Stay on task.

367
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:31,031
Make sure everything
at the Air Force base is ready.

368
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:34,112
I checked in with everyone
as of ten minutes ago.

369
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,998
We're gonna make this thing happen, Habib.

370
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:40,868
Now, remember. When you're done,
get in touch with Prado.

371
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,155
He'll get you out of the country.

372
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,231
And you?

373
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,951
Go.

374
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,515
- Good.
- What?

375
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:38,710
I can rebuild the files
from these empty directories.

376
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,517
- Dammit!
- What's he doing?

377
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,319
He's trying to rebuild the files I deleted.

378
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,914
- How can he do that?
- I don't know.

379
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,039
It's not a documented function.
Must be some hook left in by the designer.

380
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:03,317
He's gonna find evidence
we sold arms to terrorists.

381
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,311
Not necessarily.

382
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:08,949
The pulse bomb. We have to use it now.

383
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,757
- Research.
Set it off.

384
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:27,673
- We weren't scheduled for a test.
- This isn't a test.

385
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,558
Open up the safety chamber
and set it off now.

386
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,154
CTU will know
we're trying to hide something.

387
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:36,118
Marwan's the suspect.
They'll assume he was behind it.

388
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:40,432
- And the damage to the infrastructure?
- Better than destroying the company.

389
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:43,080
It'll take some time, but we can rebuild.

390
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,996
- Yeah?
- <i> EMP's been activated. Shield's open. </i>

391
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,196
OK. Good.

392
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:26,276
It's been activated. It'll take
ten minutes to charge up before its release.

393
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:53,873
Edgar? The phone taps you asked for
at McLennan-Forster aren't holding.

394
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:57,191
- What do you mean?
- Connection keeps drifting.

395
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:03,150
- Is there a problem on our end?
- Check power supply. Could be their PBX.

396
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:09,834
My God, look at this thing.
The amplitude is fluctuating like crazy.

397
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:13,435
- I thought you checked that before?
- I did. It was fine then.

398
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:16,034
Let me call Jack.

399
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:18,236
<i>The cellular customer is out of range. </i>

400
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,914
That's weird. Customer out of range?

401
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,189
- <i>McLennan-Forster. </i>
- I need Jack Bauer.

402
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:27,794
He's a CTU agent in Harris Barnes' office.

403
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,916
<i>I'll transfer you... </i>

404
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,319
Hello?

405
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:34,073
- Hello?
- What's going on?

406
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:37,118
Cell and land lines around
McLennan-Forster are out.

407
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,272
Can we use the network to message him?

408
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:47,873
- Yeah, the computers haven't been affected.
- Open up a window for me, would you?

409
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,637
What the hell's this?

410
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:02,234
I don't know.

411
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:13,916
Something's wrong. I gotta respond. Can you
pipe that window over to this computer?

412
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,798
Yeah, just give me an Ethernet address.

413
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,758
6EFF 3239.

414
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,588
I've almost got these files rebuilt.

415
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:45,039
- Do we have any data points outside?
- I'm online with the phone company.

416
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:51,150
They're getting complaints as far as
eight blocks away from the building.

417
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:58,269
- Have you still got a connection?
- Yeah, I've got it. Look at this.

418
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:03,480
Son of a bitch, it's encrypted.
That's it. Print it out, now. Now!

419
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:10,557
- Dammit! They've got something.
- What?

420
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:13,435
I can't read it. How long till it goes off?

421
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,988
- Any second. We're fine.
- He's printing it.

422
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:19,231
- What are you going to do now?
- Take care of it.

423
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,753
I don't believe this.

424
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,276
We're dealing with an EMP.

425
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:39,319
McLennan-Forster were developing
a nonlethal weapon for the military.

426
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,960
- What is it?
- An electromagnetic pulse bomb.

427
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:46,511
Once it goes off, everything
within its radius that's electrical gets fried.

428
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:51,355
Lights, cars, computers. Every piece
of electronic data just vanishes forever.

429
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,510
- How long have we got?
- I don't know.

430
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:56,239
Its capacitors are still charging.

431
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,075
Come on.

432
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:02,391
All right, the printer's warming up.

433
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:18,229
Sarah, do we have any choppers in that area?

434
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,117
Yeah, one.

435
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:24,637
If it's in the air when the EMP goes off,
that chopper's going down.

436
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,517
Get 'em out of the area now.

437
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:29,876
- Edgar, where's this coming from?
- McLennan-Forster.

438
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:32,713
CTU 3, do you hear me?

439
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,950
CTU 3, do you copy?

440
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,676
All right. This is coming through.

441
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,677
OK, I'm gonna try and stop it.

442
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:49,196
If I don't, take the hard copy,
meet me in front of the building.

443
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:55,671
Dave, Bauer ran out.
He must have found out about the EMP.

444
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:59,389
CTU agent's heading down towards you.
Don't let him near it.

445
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,550
Mr Conlon. Is everything all right?

446
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:05,349
As you can see, we're having
some problems with the electricity.

447
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,715
Jack just went to check it out.

448
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:10,030
- I saw you were printing.
- How'd you know?

449
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:15,274
Well, we were searching the system same
time you were. Trying to help you guys out.

450
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:18,670
- Mind if I take a look?
- Sure.

451
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:22,228
It's, uh, just in the printer.

452
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,912
<i>Conlon, this is Barnet. Do you copy?</i>

453
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,990
- Yeah.
- <i>Two's clear. Moving to three. </i>

454
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:11,071
All right.

455
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,109
Oh, my God.

456
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,470
It's not gonna stop.

457
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:59,269
You got nowhere to go, man.
The doors are locked.

458
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,191
Where's the printout?

459
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,791
Where is it?

460
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:13,269
Come on.

461
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:26,077
- One of our choppers is down.
- Send medical in now.

462
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:32,554
Call all field teams outside the perimeter
of the blast. We have to find Jack and Paul.

463
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:36,918
I'll get back to you. OK. All right.

464
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,390
Someone set off an EMP blast
in the McLennan-Forster building.

465
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,630
We believe Jack and Paul are inside.

466
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:47,236
I assume that's a response to us. Someone
doesn't want us to get Marwan's files.

467
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:52,189
Jack was able to pull some info before
the blast. But we don't know who set it off.

468
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:56,114
<i> Excuse me, sir. </i>
<i>Ms Driscoll's replacement arrived. </i>

469
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,668
Thank you.

470
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:01,274
- That was fast.
- We got lucky.

471
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:06,912
Division had someone available with
the qualifications and CTU experience.

472
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,560
- I understand.
- Tony, thank you for filling in.

473
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:12,996
And I'd like you to stick around
and assist Ms Dessler.

474
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:15,196
I'm sorry, who?

475
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,794
Michelle Dessler. Do you know her?

476
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,875
I used to be married to her.

477
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:45,030
