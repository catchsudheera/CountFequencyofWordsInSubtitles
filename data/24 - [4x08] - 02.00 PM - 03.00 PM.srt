1
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,277
- You killed Tariq?
- <i>You can't let Father know. </i>

2
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,510
He wants me dead
because I messed up with Debbie.

3
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,477
You ordered Tariq to kill him.

4
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,357
To kill our own son.

5
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,750
Nothing will stand in the way
of what needs to be done.

6
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:29,593
Not him, not you.

7
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,557
Your father's following us.

8
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,154
- What?
- It was the only way I could save you.

9
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,154
Mom!

10
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:42,198
I think I got it.
I can turn off the override

11
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:45,113
and stop the remaining plants
from melting down.

12
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,998
- I did the best I could, sir. I hope it works.
- So do I.

13
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:51,675
Edgar, what's going on? Why are some
of the reactors still not shutting down?

14
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,876
Six of them were immune to the kill sequence.

15
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:59,239
Contact Bauer. Either he finds the people
responsible for planting the override,

16
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,675
or we're looking a nuclear holocaust.

17
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,156
Bauer and Audrey left five minutes ago.

18
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:06,708
- Where'd they go?
- <i>Felsted Security. </i>

19
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,795
<i>You're going to need</i>
<i>to set things up on your end. </i>

20
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,711
When Bauer and Audrey Raines are killed,

21
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:15,315
CTU is going to know
that someone inside leaked their location.

22
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,550
- <i>Divert suspicion. </i>
- Fine.

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,833
The device maintains heat levels
of the reactors.

24
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,797
They can melt down each of those plants.

25
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,589
The man you saw when you
were held captive, he's our only lead.

26
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,148
Stop. There. I think that's him.

27
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,800
- They're sealing us off.
- Should we call CTU?

28
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:35,270
No. CTU's been compromised. That's
the only way they'd know we were here.

29
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,920
- Then who are you calling?
- The only person I can trust right now.

30
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,874
I'm empty.

31
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,399
Tony!

32
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,675
Is there any chance this is a mistake,

33
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:00,196
that the remaining six reactors
are just taking longer to shut down?

34
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,508
No.

35
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,275
Those plants are in the grip of the override,
which has been sealed off.

36
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,794
Did you send the list of cities
to the president?

37
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,030
- Yes.
- What about evacuation procedures?

38
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:14,352
We alerted the National Guard. We'll see
how the president wants us to proceed.

39
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,318
Ms Driscoll, the president's ready.

40
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,198
OK, put him on. Mr President.

41
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,829
<i>I understand we've been able to shut down</i>
<i>98 nuclear power plants. </i>

42
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,989
Yes, sir.

43
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:31,269
But it appears that our shutdown will not be
effective with the six remaining reactors.

44
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,511
Not going to be effective?
What exactly does that mean?

45
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:40,679
I'm afraid it means that we could have
six nuclear disasters on our hands.

46
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:47,312
What are the casualty projections
if all six plants melt down?

47
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:52,269
450,000 deaths in the first 24 hours.
Longer-range estimates in the low millions.

48
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:56,319
And that's not taking into account
the resulting cancers and birth defects.

49
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,548
Why were we able to shut down
the other power plants but not these six?

50
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,598
<i>They're still being controlled by the terrorists. </i>

51
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,275
- Because of the override device?
- Exactly.

52
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,669
We have to find the override device itself.

53
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,399
It's a prototype.
The terrorists have the only one.

54
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,913
<i>Then let's find it. </i>

55
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,999
<i>I'll order the evacuation of those six cities. </i>

56
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:20,516
- <i> Jim, keep me posted. </i>
- Yes, Mr President.

57
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,030
All right, let's get back to work.

58
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,109
- Yeah?
- Mr Secretary, it's Jack.

59
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,158
Don't let anyone know it's me.
We've got a problem.

60
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:34,152
I understand, Marcy.
Let me see what I can do.

61
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,958
- I have to take this call.
- Yes.

62
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,952
All right.
These are the projected numbers.

63
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,029
What's going on?

64
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:44,193
Audrey and I are safe, but there was an
attempt on our lives at Felsted Security.

65
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,269
What?

66
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,194
A group of assassins
took out our entire security detail.

67
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,478
Send a forensic unit to identify the bodies,
but I don't want CTU to know.

68
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,993
Why not?

69
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,753
I think someone at CTU
was complicit in the attack.

70
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,599
How do you know that?

71
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:05,073
Sir, CTU is the only agency that knew where
we were. No one else had that information.

72
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:11,476
- Is one of Erin's people with the terrorists?
- I think so. I just don't know who.

73
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:16,190
But it's clear that they didn't want
Audrey to make the ID of the man she saw.

74
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:19,113
I'm sending a Secret Service detail
to pick you up.

75
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,397
- Please don't. That's not the right thing to do.
- Why not?

76
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:26,632
I don't want anyone to know where we are.
That way I know we'll be safe.

77
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,994
How should I handle this?

78
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,072
- Remember the Melbourne situation?
- Yes.

79
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,754
<i>Try that. I think it'll work. </i>

80
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,829
OK.

81
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,673
I've got to go.
I'll get back to you when we're safe.

82
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:42,038
- Jack, take care of Audrey.
- Yes, sir. I will.

83
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,868
- Are you OK?
- I'm almost getting used to this.

84
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,798
Yeah.

85
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,429
- Is it possible that we've been followed?
- No. We're clear.

86
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,952
- Where are we going?
- We need to lay low for a while.

87
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,872
- What communication do you need?
- A wi-fi and a hardline.

88
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:09,430
- All right. We'll go back to my place.
- OK.

89
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,593
Thank you, Tony.

90
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,717
Wait till you see it before you thank me.

91
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,873
No, I mean for picking us up,
for saving our lives.

92
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:27,593
- I'm sure you're wondering what's going on.
- Not really, no.

93
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,990
- Something wrong?
- What could be wrong?

94
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,516
I'm not in federal prison
thanks to you and President Palmer.

95
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,239
Michelle left me. I...

96
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,917
You know what, never mind.
Why don't you tell me what this is all about?

97
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,639
- You heard about Audrey and her father?
- Yeah.

98
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:50,032
We were at Felsted so Audrey could make an
ID of a man she saw during the kidnapping.

99
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,157
- I don't get it. Why?
- The kidnapping was just a cover.

100
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,676
The terrorists' objective
is to gain control of power plants.

101
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,479
The man that Audrey saw is our only lead.

102
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,518
- I thought you weren't in the field any more.
- I'm not.

103
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,034
The secretary's my responsibility.

104
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,076
I got caught up in it.

105
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,833
Listen to me.
I don't want to get caught up in it.

106
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:14,232
So you do whatever you need to do
at my place. I'm staying out of it, all right?

107
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,117
Understood.

108
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:25,596
<i>Today continues to be a challenge</i>
<i>to the strength of the American spirit. </i>

109
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,275
<i>We have a condition in six cities</i>
<i>across the United States</i>

110
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,399
<i>in which nuclear power facilities</i>
<i>may become unstable. </i>

111
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:36,552
<i>While we work to regain control</i>
<i>over these facilities,</i>

112
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:40,519
<i>I am also asking our National Guard</i>
<i>to assist local authorities</i>

113
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:44,354
<i>to effect an immediate evacuation</i>
<i>of those six cities. </i>

114
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:48,956
<i>This evacuation is only being issued</i>
<i>for all persons living or working within... </i>

115
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:53,192
The president didn't mention
that there isn't time for complete evacuation.

116
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,714
If those reactors melt down,

117
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:59,190
there'll be at least 50,000 dead per city.

118
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,078
We still have time
to find a way to prevent that.

119
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,392
I can tell you now, Erin, the chances
of doing that from here are very low.

120
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:11,270
We have to find the people
who have the override device.

121
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,352
What about the hospitals north of there?

122
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,590
All right. Keep checking.

123
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,559
- I called Dina's sister. There's no answer.
- I'll take care of it.

124
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,837
- You and Ravi check the station again.
- OK.

125
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:29,872
The Americans have been able
to shut down most of the reactors.

126
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:33,270
- How many are under our control?
- Six.

127
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,590
More than enough to break their will.

128
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,879
I'll have to manage the override personally.
Make sure those six melt down on schedule.

129
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,713
- Is there anything I can do?
- Yes.

130
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,234
Take care of your mess.

131
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,515
Don't worry, Marwan.
I give you my word.

132
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:52,593
My wife and son will be dead
by the end of this day.

133
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,999
- We have to get you to a hospital.
- No.

134
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,551
Your father knows I've been shot.
He'll be looking for us in all the hospitals.

135
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:13,438
We're going to have to take a chance.
You're hurt.

136
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,511
- I'll be OK.
- No, you won't.

137
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:19,036
You need to get to a doctor.
I'm not afraid of Father.

138
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,111
You should be.

139
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,078
He tried to kill me,
and then he did this to you.

140
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,310
He is not my father any more.

141
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,348
Mom, please.

142
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:38,639
All right. Drop me off at an emergency room,
but then you have to drive away.

143
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:42,713
No. Whatever happens,
we're staying together.

144
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,757
I'm running a filter for Driscoll.
Could you baby-sit it?

145
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,035
- Sure.
- Thanks.

146
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:24,511
- <i> Yes?</i>
- I couldn't take your call. I was in a meeting.

147
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,275
- Bauer and Audrey Raines are alive.
- My information was accurate.

148
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,875
Yes. Their location was correct,
but they survived the attack.

149
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,952
- Are they headed back to CTU?
- I haven't heard anything.

150
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,555
- Bauer didn't call in?
- <i>Not that I'm aware of. </i>

151
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,279
That doesn't make sense.

152
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,952
It makes perfect sense.

153
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,749
He knows there's been a breach
and he's told someone. I gotta get out.

154
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:50,310
No. You have to stay in
until we take care of Bauer and the woman.

155
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,437
What about me?
I won't spend the rest of my life in jail.

156
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,796
You'll be taken care of.
You know that. Now, go.

157
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,237
There you are.

158
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:08,278
- What?
- Division's waiting for those projections.

159
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,193
- They're ready to be sent.
- Then send them.

160
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,719
Yeah?

161
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,679
Sir, your assistant Scott Borman just arrived.
Should I send him in?

162
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,389
Thanks.

163
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,677
Mr Secretary,
it's good to see you safe and sound, sir.

164
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,591
Thanks, Scott. Sit down.

165
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,030
- Is there a problem, sir?
- There's a big problem.

166
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:44,557
Someone inside CTU is leaking information
to someone on the outside.

167
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,837
- What do you need me to do?
- I need you to go to Erin Driscoll.

168
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,230
Tell her that Jack Bauer
is no longer at Felsted Security

169
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:56,110
and that he's watching surveillance videos
at the old CTU substation in Torrance.

170
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:00,318
- Anything about when Jack will call?
- When they identify the man Audrey saw.

171
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,551
I take it Jack and Audrey
are nowhere near the substation?

172
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,518
Right. We're trying to flush out the mole.

173
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,513
Then you'll need me to put a DOD Comsat
envelope around this place.

174
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:14,752
If anyone sends out a communication
containing the information you planted,

175
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,876
that's the spy.

176
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,918
- Yes, sir.
- Let's go.

177
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,513
Watch your step,
the dog next door likes our yard.

178
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,958
Well, here we are. Home, sweet home.

179
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,591
Just stay here.

180
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:20,152
- Oh, God! Who the hell are you?
- Jack, it's OK.

181
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:26,430
- This is my friend, Jen.
- Tell him to play with his guns outside.

182
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:29,717
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

183
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,268
I'm sorry.

184
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:36,512
- I thought you were working.
- I'm going in late.

185
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,591
This is Jack and his friend Audrey.

186
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,999
This is Jen.

187
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,798
Hi.

188
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:45,873
I saw you on TV today. You're the daughter
of the secretary of defense.

189
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,713
You and your old man
were kidnapped this morning.

190
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,598
- Yeah.
- What's going on?

191
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,199
- I'm helping them out.
- Could you be more specific?

192
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,236
We need to use Tony's computer.

193
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:00,357
What, they don't have computers
where you work?

194
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:06,479
Listen, we have a situation here, all right?
They need to lie low for a little bit.

195
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,279
We can't let anybody know
they're here, all right?

196
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,999
Whatever. I'm leaving, anyway.

197
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,958
- Tony.
- Jen, you can't go anywhere.

198
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:19,272
- Why not?
- We can't leave till Jack and Audrey take off.

199
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,989
- We can't take a chance.
- What kind of chance? I work at a bar.

200
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:27,358
- I'm sorry, Jen. We're not gonna be long.
- Stay as long as you want. I have a job.

201
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,715
He doesn't.

202
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,197
Jen, can I talk to you for a second?

203
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,950
Please.

204
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,751
Sorry.

205
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:47,070
No, she seems real sweet.

206
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,878
Look, we were fighting for our lives
a few minutes ago.

207
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,428
If it hadn't been for Tony,
we'd have been dead.

208
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:58,355
I've been through a lot today and I'm sure
when this is over, your boss will understand.

209
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,510
And if he doesn't?

210
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,637
I can have him killed.

211
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,799
- Knock yourself out.
- Thank you.

212
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,836
How are you guys making out?

213
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,990
I have to convert this so I can read it,

214
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:16,789
and then hopefully you can make an ID
from the surveillance video.

215
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:21,317
- I have some software for that. I'll dig it out.
- Thanks.

216
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:24,517
You told me about Tony,
but I didn't know Michelle left him.

217
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:29,276
- Yeah, after he got out of prison.
- I thought he went to prison because of her.

218
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,397
He saved her life
and she paid him back by leaving him?

219
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,837
That's the way Tony sees it too.
It didn't happen exactly like that.

220
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:42,119
When he got out of prison he was angry. He
couldn't get a job. I don't think he wanted one.

221
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,430
He started drinking.

222
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:47,159
And he pushed her away.

223
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:51,313
- What is she doing now?
- She's a deputy director over at Division.

224
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:55,109
- I hope he can help us.
- If he can, he will.

225
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,156
- Here we go.
- You got it?

226
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,834
Yeah, got it right here.

227
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,077
Thanks.

228
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,477
We're in.

229
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,593
- Did you start the ball rolling with Driscoll?
- Yep. I'm headed to her briefing.

230
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,956
She won't be happy when she knows
we're using her to find the mole.

231
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,157
I'm surprised you felt the need
to keep her in the dark.

232
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:29,155
As long as there's a leak in CTU,
we keep everyone in the dark.

233
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,992
Make sure you're on line
and your databases are unlocked.

234
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:43,756
As soon as Jack sends the image, we need to
move as quickly as possible to make this ID.

235
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:46,229
Why is Jack doing this at the old substation?

236
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,312
There's technical reasons.
I didn't speak with him.

237
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:52,039
- Who did?
- I did.

238
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:57,196
He also asked that his whereabouts
be kept strictly internal until he contacts us.

239
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,748
All right. Let's go.

240
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:35,276
Old CTU substation in Torrance.

241
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,115
I remember this lady.
We saw him around here.

242
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,309
There he is.

243
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,597
- Are you sure that's him?
- Yes.

244
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:00,275
- I'll route this through the DC office.
- <i> I was there on Friday. </i>

245
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:04,797
Tony, she's on the phone.
We can't have her making calls.

246
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,759
Give me the phone.
- I can't go to work, I can't talk on the phone?

247
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,637
- Give me the phone.
- Go to hell!

248
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,439
- Give me the damn phone!
- Fine!

249
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,869
- Go ahead.
- Thanks.

250
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,550
- This is Marcy.
- <i>It's Jack. </i>

251
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,915
<i>I'm sending you the image we need ID'd. </i>

252
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,798
- We're ready to receive.
- OK.

253
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:46,952
- You're positive this came from her system?
- Yeah.

254
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:52,034
The voices were digitised, but we were able
to make out the words "CTU substation".

255
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,758
- Where's security?
- On their way.

256
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,831
Thanks, Scott.

257
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,468
Yes, Mr Secretary?

258
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:04,870
- Erin, there's been a breach in CTU.
- What?

259
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,158
- The information Scott gave you is false.
- What do you mean, false?

260
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:14,155
Jack and Audrey were ambushed
at Felsted Security. They survived the attack,

261
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,870
but it's clear
that someone in this office gave them up.

262
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:23,078
With all due respect, sir,
you knew about this and you didn't tell me?

263
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:27,229
Being left out is not something
you should be concerned about.

264
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:31,029
I assume you're telling me because
your operation yielded a result.

265
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,236
Yes, it did. Read that.

266
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:40,038
- Where is she?
- She's about to be taken into custody.

267
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,111
Join me.

268
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,715
- Ms Driscoll, what's going on?
- Go with these men.

269
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,075
- What for?
- You're under arrest, Gavin.

270
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:33,517
- You've been passing classified information.
- What?

271
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,398
- What are you talking about?
- Take her to holding.

272
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,994
Holding? Ms Driscoll!

273
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:43,551
What are you doing?
Ms Driscoll, I haven't done anything.

274
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,279
Ms Driscoll, this is a mistake.

275
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,708
What is happening?

276
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:55,598
Will you tell me what's going on?
I didn't do anything. Please!

277
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,989
Get back to work.

278
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:20,116
I don't care how you divide up her files. I want
everything off her system and sent to me.

279
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:23,909
- And enter new pass codes.
- We can't just do this on your authority.

280
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,513
Edgar.

281
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,637
- It's OK.
- But he works for DOD, not CTU.

282
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,280
Well, he's the one that found the mole, right?

283
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:35,990
And Heller wants him to have joint authority.
Finish up here and get back to station two.

284
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,868
The program you set up for the reactors
is almost finished compiling.

285
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,190
- Can I see this?
- Sure.

286
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,830
What makes you so sure Sarah's the mole?

287
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,559
She sent out encoded information
about Bauer.

288
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,791
She wouldn't compromise
Bauer or the investigation.

289
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:55,395
That's how she fooled us.
She's the last person you'd expect to do it.

290
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:58,358
All right. Just give me those files.

291
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:05,469
It's right here. "2:22pm, message sent.
Old CTU substation in Torrance. "

292
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:08,518
It doesn't seem weird
that she'd leave it on her system?

293
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,637
- It was encrypted.
- With a Bainbridge algorit

294
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:14,871
It's so old school it's like saying
"Please decode me".

295
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:20,034
Let's face it,
Sarah wasn't the sharpest knife in the drawer.

296
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,793
Please, Ms Driscoll. I promise you
there's been some kind of mistake.

297
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:34,557
How? Your system was isolated, the message
was sent from it while you were there.

298
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,108
Somebody set me up.
It's the only explanation.

299
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,792
Tell me how.

300
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,236
Someone backed into my system,
planted something.

301
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,959
We checked.
None of them were compromised.

302
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,235
Let's stop playing games.

303
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:52,030
Thousands of lives are at stake. Where
are the people who control the override?

304
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:55,430
I don't know. That's what I was working on.

305
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:00,753
- Who did you send the message to?
- I didn't.

306
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,637
Ms Driscoll...

307
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:07,399
I would never betray our country
or endanger lives. You know that.

308
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:11,837
Is it the contact who coordinated the attempt
on Jack and Audrey's life at Felsted Security?

309
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:16,072
- I don't know. It wasn't me.
- I learned my lesson today with Sherek

310
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:20,756
and I am no longer gonna err
on the side of caution in these interrogations.

311
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,434
Do you get my meaning?

312
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,071
I don't know what to say.

313
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,878
Eric, no!

314
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,315
Please don't do this.

315
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,598
Eric! Ms Driscoll!

316
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,511
- Please stop.
- If you want it to stop,

317
00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:01,151
you tell me
where the Dobson override is and who has it.

318
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,390
I swear I don't know anything.

319
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,077
Wait!

320
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:19,956
There has got to be an explanation for this.
You've got to give me some time to think.

321
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,836
Talk to me, Sarah. Talk to me.

322
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,717
Ms Driscoll...

323
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,878
I'm not a spy.

324
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:45,236
I'm not. Please believe me.

325
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,149
Ms Driscoll, please.

326
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:56,112
- I'm concerned.
- Do you think you can break her in time?

327
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:59,158
I can break her in time if she's guilty.

328
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,676
According to Scott,
there is no way that this could be a mistake.

329
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,513
I agree it's hard evidence,

330
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:11,310
but I've known Sarah for eight months
and she doesn't fit the profile.

331
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,358
How do you want to handle it?

332
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:18,479
I'll watch for a few more minutes,
then I'll go back in.

333
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:21,074
I'll brief Jack.

334
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,957
<i>Eric, please!</i>

335
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:27,079
Please!

336
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:30,277
Eric! Eric, no!

337
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,956
What are you doing?

338
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:36,316
I'm checking the surveillance
to see who he was talking to.

339
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,312
- Did you find anything?
- No, not yet.

340
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:43,749
- Anybody want a beer?
- I could use one.

341
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,835
- This is Bauer.
- <i> We found our mole. </i>

342
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:55,276
- Who is it?
- Sarah Gavin. Works in comm.

343
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,796
- Is she working alone?
- As far as we know.

344
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:03,078
I'll call Marcy, tell her the CTU channels
are open. We'll start sharing data.

345
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:06,072
How's Audrey doing?

346
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,230
She's good. She's resting.

347
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,073
I think now would be a good time
to have her picked up.

348
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:14,357
We're at 21408, Kipling, North Hollywood.

349
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,317
What's there?

350
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,436
A friend.

351
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,636
I'll send the Secret Service.

352
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,915
Thank you, sir.

353
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:29,950
Your father's sending someone over
to take you back to CTU.

354
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,189
OK.

355
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:49,590
Don't you think you've made me
miss enough TV today, Jack?

356
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,673
Why didn't you ever call me?

357
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,317
For what?

358
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,073
I've been there. I could help.

359
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:12,436
I'm considered a traitor to this country.

360
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,954
My wife left me.

361
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:20,032
So how are you gonna help me, huh, Jack?

362
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,508
Yeah.

363
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,397
Look...

364
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:35,077
I owed you for getting me out of prison,

365
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,628
but today I repaid that debt.

366
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,193
To tell you the truth,

367
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:45,875
all you do is remind me of a past
I'm trying to forget.

368
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,990
So why don't you do me a favour?

369
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,273
Do what you need to do here,

370
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,749
and let's leave it at that.

371
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,831
All right?

372
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,237
Yeah.

373
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,637
How did this happen?

374
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:33,716
I was working in the yard and backed
into a nail that sticks out of our gate.

375
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,075
Ow.

376
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,073
This looks like a gunshot wound.

377
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,992
I'm afraid it was nothing that exciting, Doctor.

378
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:52,029
It was my fault.
I was supposed to fix that gate last week.

379
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:57,197
All right. You're gonna need a tetanus shot.
Then I'll stitch it up.

380
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,316
Thank you, Doctor.

381
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:02,119
Yeah. I'll be right back.

382
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,190
Go watch him.

383
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:20,950
- What's going on?
- He said something to the nurse.

384
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:24,233
Did he make a phone call?

385
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:27,357
- Not that I could see.
- Did she?

386
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,954
- No.
- Good.

387
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,913
Maybe it wouldn't be so bad
if they called the police.

388
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,390
- The police could protect us from Father.
- It would be bad.

389
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,392
To go to jail for the rest of our lives?

390
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:46,074
That's what would happen.

391
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:54,269
Where are we going to go
after we leave here?

392
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:58,797
If we can get out of the city and stay
somewhere for a couple of days,

393
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:02,190
I can arrange for us to get out of the country.

394
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,154
- Yeah?
- <i> Jack, it's Marcy. We got a match. </i>

395
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,310
- Who is it?
- <i>His name is Henry Powell. </i>

396
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:25,554
- <i>I've posted everything on the secure site. </i>
- Hold on a second.

397
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,509
<i>OK. I got it. </i>

398
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,637
He was a computer consultant
for McLennen-Forster.

399
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,948
Wait a second.

400
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:36,396
They designed the device
controlling the power plants.

401
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:40,029
He's not there any more,
but he freelances for them. He's in LA.

402
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:42,429
- How do you know?
- He's trying to leave the city.

403
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:45,751
He's scheduled a chopper
to meet him in Van Nuys in 15 minutes.

404
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:50,709
- I thought air traffic had been grounded.
- It is. He got a special clearance.

405
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:54,793
- Son of a bitch. Where in Van Nuys?
- <i>The helipad at the Larchmont building. </i>

406
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,111
I want you to ground his flight,
but not until I get there.

407
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,270
- They're here.
- <i>Can you make it in time?</i>

408
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:04,433
I'm gonna try.
Go get your things. We've got to go.

409
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,715
- Davis, Secret Service.
- Jack Bauer.

410
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,792
- Take Audrey back to CTU.
- Those are our orders.

411
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,509
- OK. You got a car for me?
- It's right over there.

412
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,034
Thank you. Audrey, they're ready.

413
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:24,871
This is Agent Davis.
He's gonna take care of you.

414
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:28,111
- Be careful.
- I will. You too.

415
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,433
- <i>CTU.</i>
- It's Jack. Let me speak to Erin Driscoll.

416
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,988
<i>Right away. </i>

417
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,637
I just got the file on Henry Powell.
I'm going through it now.

418
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,154
He's leaving the city.
I have to get to Van Nuys.

419
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,879
- You want air backup?
- No. I want a low profile.

420
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:51,714
- I don't want to spook him.
- A ground package is gonna be 30 minutes.

421
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:54,598
- That's too long.
- When is his flight due to take off?

422
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:57,240
- Less than 15 minutes.
- <i>What do you want to do?</i>

423
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:00,710
He's most likely on his own.
I'll have to handle this myself.

424
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:04,349
- All right. I'll send a team anyway.
- I'll be in touch.

425
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:07,398
- What will you handle by yourself?
- It's covered.

426
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:12,395
It would be pretty stupid of me to let you die
after I risked my life trying to save you.

427
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,074
Could you use my help?

428
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,714
- Yeah.
- All right. Let's go.

429
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,917
- Curtis.
- Yeah, Edgar?

430
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,070
- Has Sarah confessed to anything?
- No.

431
00:31:54,160 --> 00:32:00,156
- What are they doing to her?
- Don't worry about it. Just get back to work.

432
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:10,748
Curtis, what did Edgar want?

433
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:13,400
- Why?
- Let him know we need his full attention.

434
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:16,074
Get back to your station.

435
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,269
What's that?

436
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:35,717
Just something to numb the arm
so that I can close the wound.

437
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:38,155
OK.

438
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,231
I really wish you'd let me admit you.

439
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:44,154
This wound is serious.
There's a chance of an infection here.

440
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:48,631
No, Doctor, please.
Do whatever you can and we'll leave.

441
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:52,918
- Behrooz, where are you going?
- I'll be right back, Mom.

442
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,749
- The police are here.
- Did you call them?

443
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:07,479
- This is a gunshot wound.
- I told you it wasn't.

444
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:11,439
- Then why are you acting so strangely?
- Let's go.

445
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:14,034
You shouldn't leave! You need treatment!

446
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,599
Susan! Susan!

447
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,917
Wait.

448
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,510
Let's go.

449
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,749
Come on. Come on.

450
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,550
Marianne?

451
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:24,629
What is it?

452
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:27,075
You asked me
to bump up your security clearance.

453
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:31,039
I was a little busy with the override,
but I finally got it for you.

454
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:33,111
Great. Thanks.

455
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,515
What?

456
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:42,993
You'll need to pick a password.
I set up the screen on server five.

457
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:52,115
There you go. Use the same password
as the one that unlocks your system files.

458
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,918
OK.

459
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,433
Edgar.

460
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:42,313
- Why do you keep looking at me?
- I don't.

461
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,470
Let's go outside. I want to talk to you.

462
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,552
I don't want to talk to you.
I have a lot of work to do.

463
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:50,313
It is getting incredibly tedious, Edgar,

464
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:56,475
to have to remind you repeatedly that I could
step into Driscoll's office and have you fired.

465
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:06,192
- Curtis. I need to talk to you.
- What is it?

466
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,919
- Walk with me to Driscoll's office.
- Walk with you?

467
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,468
Please, Curtis.

468
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,831
Let's go.

469
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:27,068
If Sarah is guilty, we shouldn't need...

470
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,957
- Sorry to interrupt.
- What is it?

471
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:32,476
- You got the wrong one. Sarah's not guilty.
- How do you know?

472
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:38,396
I just sneaked into Marianne's system. She
used Sarah's to communicate outside of CTU.

473
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,438
Sarah's station was isolated from the subnet.

474
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,795
- She didn't use it.
- How did she do it?

475
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:47,031
- She use a plain old AC power line.
- What?

476
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:51,636
That's the last place anybody would
ever look. Plus it has plenty of bandwidth.

477
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:54,029
Where is she?

478
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:01,993
She's trying to leave the building.
Lock down the exits!

479
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,390
There she goes!

480
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,838
She's heading out the southwest side door.
Side door.

481
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,389
You're under arrest.

482
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:42,389
Examine the contents.
Impound the car, strip and search it.

483
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,789
I got her.

484
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,952
- Mr Powell?
- Yeah, let's go.

485
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,837
- We can't.
- What?

486
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:23,038
- The flight's been grounded.
- McLennen-Forster has special ordinance.

487
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:25,998
- I know, but the order was superseded.
- By who?

488
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:28,958
The Department of Defense.

489
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:34,114
- You're going to fly me out of here.
- Please. Sir!

490
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,509
Now! Get in.

491
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:52,308
- All right. Where are we going?
- Just get us in the air and fly east.

492
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,072
There it is.

493
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,871
Do not take off!

494
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:32,714
- Do not take off!
- Get us in the air! Go! Go!

495
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,030
- Shut it down!
I said now!

496
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:37,998
Come on! Move! Hurry up!

497
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:41,716
Drop the weapon now! Now!

498
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,519
Step out! Get down! Now!

499
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:48,956
Get out of the helicopter. Move! Move!

500
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,349
Let me see your hands! Now!

501
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,631
Get up!

502
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,029
Move!

503
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:01,359
Where are you taking me?
I haven't done anything.

504
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,590
Put your hands on the roof of the truck.

505
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:07,468
- The people I know, they'll pay you.
- Shut up!

506
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,198
I got his cellphone! Bring me the bag!

507
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,516
Put your hands behind your back.

508
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:04,592
Who are you guys? Police? FBI?

509
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,152
- Actually, I'm currently unemployed.
- I'll make it worth your while.

510
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,989
- Put him in the back.
- Come on.

511
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:27,310
He's dead, Jack.

512
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,833
Dammit!

513
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:58,877
