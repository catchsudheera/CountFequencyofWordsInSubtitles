1
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,473
You're not my son.

2
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:18,233
Why? Because I don't
want to kill innocent people?

3
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,869
Because you're weak,
and you stand for nothing!

4
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,188
Is there a problem, Navi?

5
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,113
Government agents arrested Dina
and surrounded the building.

6
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:29,158
How much more time
do you need to melt down the plants?

7
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,468
One hour, maybe two.

8
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,357
I don't want to have to kill you, but I will.

9
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:35,910
I have the suspect in custody.
I need assistance.

10
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,796
I need you to take Dina and her son
back to CTU and head the interrogation.

11
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:47,475
They'd never let me set foot in CTU,
even if I wanted to.

12
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,515
I can get you reinstated. But I need
to know now, is that what you want?

13
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,637
- I'm sure you're aware of my history here.
- Not an issue.

14
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,871
Jack Bauer and Secretary Heller
both vouch for you. That's enough for me.

15
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,197
Did he work directly for the terrorists?

16
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:04,956
- I told you, I don't know.
- I need names who can get us to the override.

17
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,996
This place may not be as empty as it seems.

18
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,913
- What? You think this is some kind of trap?
- Yes. I do.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,912
I didn't give them anything. I...

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,912
What does CTU know about the override?

21
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:21,869
Audrey, it's me.

22
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,757
Hey. Did you find anything?

23
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:28,079
The company that owns the building...
Galaxy Financial. Ever heard of them?

24
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:31,391
- No. Should I have?
- Your husband's the chief financial officer.

25
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,313
What's really going on?
What? Are you spying on me?

26
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,949
- Are you doing something to spy on?
- What is that supposed to mean?

27
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,157
- Take your hands off of her!
- You set me up!

28
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,676
Put your hands on your head now.

29
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:48,514
- What do you want?
- I want answers.

30
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,712
You should leave the room
while I question your husband.

31
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,995
Wait outside with the backup team.

32
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,557
- What are you gonna do to him?
- Whatever I have to.

33
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,954
I'm staying.

34
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,835
Fine.

35
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,511
Look at me, Paul.

36
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,758
- Look at me.
- I've got nothing to say to you.

37
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,637
This is what you need to know, Paul.

38
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,711
Five power plants are ready to melt down.

39
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,633
All I care about is making sure
that doesn't happen.

40
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,157
Your name is on a lease on a building in
Chatsworth that was used to plan the attack.

41
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:17,153
That makes you a prime suspect.
I'm gonna treat you like one. Understand?

42
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,993
My name is on at least 50 different leases.

43
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,789
I own ten corporations. I don't know
about some building in Chatsworth.

44
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,314
I don't believe you.

45
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,437
The lease was notarised.
There's documentation of your ID.

46
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,351
CTU verified your signature.

47
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,193
Paul, you need to start talking to me now.

48
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,317
I've got nothing to say to you.

49
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,597
Jack...

50
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,830
Paul wouldn't betray this country.

51
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,718
Paul is a prime suspect
and he's not cooperating,

52
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,268
and I don't have time
to do this any other way.

53
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,635
I need to know for sure.

54
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,396
Paul...

55
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,836
This is the last chance to talk to me
before I have to hurt you.

56
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,471
Tell me about 24878 Alvert Street in
Chatsworth. Why is your name on the lease?

57
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,630
- Jack...
- Audrey, don't interfere!

58
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,190
If you need to step outside of this room, do it.

59
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:23,158
Why is your name on the lease?

60
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,799
You're bluffing.

61
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,711
If you've got information, Paul, I need it now.

62
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:50,590
Come on, Paul, just tell me.
What's your connection with the terrorists?

63
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,833
Jack...

64
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,876
Please don't.

65
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,675
All right, wait, wait.

66
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:13,594
I don't know the specific building
you're talking about. I can find out.

67
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,272
How?

68
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,753
My corporate records are on my laptop. If that
address is under my name, then it'll come up.

69
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:24,628
- Maybe there's someone else involved.
- What's your user-ID number?

70
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,872
L- i-it'll be much quicker if I just do it.

71
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,110
Please.

72
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:50,436
You want me to believe you're not involved
with this? You better show me who is.

73
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:14,278
Sorry I had to call you here, Marwan,
but I had no choice.

74
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:18,558
CTU is trying to disable the override
using a Drinfeld module.

75
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,313
They've already shut down over 90 reactors.

76
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,675
We always knew they'd stop some of them.

77
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,877
The important thing
is that one reactor has melted down.

78
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,272
As long as the override has control
of the other five, I can do the rest from here.

79
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,352
Everything is ready for you upstairs.

80
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,754
- Will anyone in the office be suspicious?
- I reported a system failure.

81
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,753
If anyone asks, tell them you're from IT
restoring my hard drive.

82
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,355
My desk is in the last row,
three from the end, C86.

83
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,115
The override is well-disguised
inside the desk. Here is the key.

84
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,031
- Good.
- How long will you need?

85
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,554
45 minutes to melt down the remaining ones.

86
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,835
I am here if you need anything.

87
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:04,596
- Where's the CTU agent?
- Forbes is questioning him now.

88
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,629
He's out. He's not gonna tell us anything.

89
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:05,272
- What does Marwan want us to do with him?
- Finish him off, then get rid of the body.

90
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,954
Take care of it.

91
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,632
He came with a woman and two agents.

92
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,191
- Where are their bodies?
- They're already in the van.

93
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,879
- Here. Here it is. Galaxy Financial Services.
- What kind of a company is it?

94
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:22,032
It's a failing payroll service
I was about to dissolve,

95
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:25,157
and someone made an offer
to buy 51 per cent of the shares.

96
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,754
7-800 grand, something like that.

97
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:32,914
- Here. Harris Barnes, director.
- Who is Harris Barnes?

98
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,754
- I... don't remember.
- What do you mean, you don't remember?

99
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:40,355
I'm involved with over 30 companies.
I don't deal directly with them.

100
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,113
- How did your name get on the lease?
- I don't know.

101
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:47,233
You're saying you entered a deal
worth hundreds of thousands of dollars

102
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,912
with someone you'd never met?

103
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,878
- My attorney handles most...
- I don't believe you.

104
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:58,115
Jack, it's possible. Paul has put together
a lot of deals through his attorneys.

105
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,429
<i>This is Sarah. </i>

106
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,512
- It's me. I need you to run a name for me.
- Go ahead.

107
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:17,310
Harris Barnes, a director of a California
S corporation, Galaxy Financial Services.

108
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,628
What am I looking for?

109
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,952
Where he lives, businesses,
anything that could connect him to terrorists.

110
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,874
- All right. Give me a minute.
- I'll be here.

111
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,589
She's calling me right back. Excuse me.

112
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:35,276
Audrey, your boyfriend
is just a thug with a badge.

113
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,158
Why is your name on that lease?

114
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,789
Unbelievable.

115
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:46,510
An hour ago I was sitting here feeling sorry
for myself that you didn't want me back.

116
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:50,115
And now you think I'm a terrorist.

117
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,879
You think I was involved
with the kidnapping?

118
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,793
I don't know what to believe any more.

119
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,275
Yeah?

120
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:08,672
I ran down the name Harris Barnes.
A lot of data came up, but it was inconsistent.

121
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:13,436
I went into the IRS records and he didn't
appear on their logs until two years ago.

122
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,509
So it's an alias.

123
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:18,752
It's a washed ID with a valid social
security number and credit card history.

124
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:22,674
Interpol traced the name and listed
foreign nationals who have used it.

125
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:26,753
- Who used it most recently?
- A man named Habib Marwan.

126
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,193
We need to find him.

127
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,430
- I think we have.
- What do you mean?

128
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:33,592
He used the name Harris Barnes
to lease office space in LA.

129
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,719
It turns out the same address was given to us
an hour ago by Marianne Taylor.

130
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,792
- She and Curtis are there now.
- What's the address?

131
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,155
The 29th floor of the Rockland building.

132
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,913
I'm on my way.
When Curtis calls, patch him through.

133
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,878
You got it. You think Marwan's there?

134
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:52,873
Right now it's our only lead.
If he is, that's where the override is.

135
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,520
I'll get back to you.

136
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,390
<i>I want you to tell me who's still out there. </i>

137
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:18,349
I want the name of anyone who can help find
that override to stop the plants melting down.

138
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:21,193
My husband kept all this from me.
I only helped.

139
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,919
Yeah, that's a bunch of crap!

140
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,993
Now, we know you were
just as involved as your husband.

141
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,959
We're aware that the only reason
you're helping us is because of your son,

142
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:38,036
but believe me, it's not too late for us
to change our minds about how we treat him.

143
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:46,350
There are a few men
whose names I heard Navi mention.

144
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:49,238
They might know what you want...

145
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,910
but I don't know how to find them.

146
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,718
All right.

147
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,113
Why don't you start
by writing their names down?

148
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:12,590
As far as we can tell, this Habib
Marwan's been controlling the override.

149
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,830
- Jack's on his way there now?
- Yes.

150
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,990
Curtis and his team are already there.

151
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:21,949
We haven't been able to reach him or his
team members. He's not answering his cell.

152
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,554
- How far is Jack?
- About 15 minutes out.

153
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:28,918
Keep trying Curtis. Tell him Jack's
on the way. We have to coordinate them.

154
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,797
OK.

155
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,631
Tony, ask her about a man
named Habib Marwan.

156
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,949
Who's Habib Marwan?

157
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:50,318
I heard Navi speak of him a few times.

158
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,630
He's an engineer.

159
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:56,317
Beyond that, I don't know.

160
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,592
- <i> Ms Driscoll?</i>
- Yes?

161
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:08,639
<i>This is Nurse Carlson in the clinic. </i>
<i>There's a problem with your daughter. </i>

162
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,793
<i>I think you should get down here</i>
<i>as soon as you can. </i>

163
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,994
- I'll be right there.
- <i>Thank you. </i>

164
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,359
It's the agent's phone.
What should we do with it?

165
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,079
Nothing. Let them wonder where he is.

166
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:36,597
By the time they realise what's happened,
it will be too late.

167
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:40,468
Find out if Adam and Jason have disposed
of the body. They should be back.

168
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,551
All right.

169
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,870
<i>The radiation cloud- tell us more about that. </i>

170
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,428
<i>The government confirmed... </i>

171
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,675
<i>How is the evacuation moving?</i>

172
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,711
<i> It's moving slowly... </i>

173
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,270
- Yeah?
- Ali, Adam and Jason are dead.

174
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:17,238
- Did the agent escape?
- No. The door is armed.

175
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,311
He's still on this floor.

176
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,356
- Find him.
- <i>Yeah. </i>

177
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,319
- Yes?
- The CTU agent is loose on this floor.

178
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,960
- How did he escape?
- He killed two of our men.

179
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:39,034
- Does he know the override is here?
- I don't think so. We have the exits covered.

180
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,237
Disconnect all the hard lines.
He can't contact CTU.

181
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,311
I will.

182
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,759
Maya...
- No, no, you can't keep me here!

183
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,909
- Maya...
- No!

184
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,152
- We want to help you feel better.
- I'll feel better when you get out of my face!

185
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,118
- Maya!
- What took you so long?

186
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,998
- I thought she took a sedative.
- She's fighting it.

187
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:12,709
- Give me a few minutes.
- Sure. Ruth...

188
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,952
Honey, I brought you here so you could
be near me. Isn't that what you wanted?

189
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,032
I want for us to go home.

190
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:24,636
Maya, we will, honey,
but we can't just yet. Honey.

191
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,792
I don't like these people here.

192
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:31,759
Maya, Maya.
That's not gonna make you feel better.

193
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,229
You're wrong. I do feel better.

194
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,029
- Sweetheart, I need you to...
- Go! Get out!

195
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:44,349
You're such an important person. Why don't
you take care of your important business?

196
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:47,750
- Oh, Maya.
- Doctor!

197
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,637
Doctor! Doctor!

198
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:52,280
Yes, Maya?

199
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,995
I'm sorry.

200
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,958
I'm sorry I was misbehaving,

201
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,679
but I promise to be good

202
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:04,231
if you'll just get that out of here.

203
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,274
I'm going.

204
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,838
I'm going.

205
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,995
Bye.

206
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:25,077
- I'll be in my office if you need me.
- All right.

207
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,275
Come on, Maya.

208
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,676
Curtis isn't answering his phone?

209
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,433
<i> Right. It rang before I got his message. </i>

210
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,988
If he had turned it off
it would go to voice mail.

211
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,959
- Where are the field teams?
- Castle's team will be there in two minutes.

212
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:45,555
I can have them set up a staging area
and stand by for your command.

213
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:48,950
- What's the probability that Marwan's there?
- We don't know yet.

214
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,792
Where are they staging?

215
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,555
In a parking lot in northwest
Wilshire and Grand, one block away.

216
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,039
OK.

217
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:59,510
- Have your people found Marwan yet?
- No.

218
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:06,314
Audrey, I would never be involved in anything
that could bring you harm.

219
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:11,269
Of all the people he could have approached
he chose you. It's a hell of a coincidence.

220
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:15,956
It might not be a coincidence. Maybe they
wanted him for more than the corporate shell.

221
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,508
He chose Paul because he was my husband?

222
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,989
That would put them close to your father.

223
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:24,072
So this Marwan used me
to get to Audrey's father?

224
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,513
It's a possibility.

225
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,558
I had no idea where Audrey
or her father would be today.

226
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,234
The information couldn't have come from me.

227
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:34,437
They used your relationship
with her father for something.

228
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:39,799
Maybe to plan something for the future,
a contingency plan.

229
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,189
I've been careless.

230
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,633
I am so sorry.

231
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:20,832
All right, so far every name Dina has given us
has checked out as a mid-level cell member.

232
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:26,392
But Marwan, who she claims to have never
met, is connected to everyone on this list.

233
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,313
It looks like all roads lead to him.

234
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:34,554
This must be his operation, which means she
definitely knows more than she's telling us.

235
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:40,476
- What do you want to do to make her talk?
- I just need you to give me a little bit of rope.

236
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,551
Do it.

237
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,914
Why don't you tell me about Habib Marwan?

238
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,072
- I already told you.
- No.

239
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:04,153
- You told me you never met him.
- I haven't.

240
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,118
Danny, could you come in here, please?

241
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:20,031
I'm gonna need all video and audio
monitoring in this room disconnected.

242
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,111
Thank you.

243
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:28,516
I'm not a stupid woman.

244
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:33,310
- What are you trying to prove with this?
- I'm not trying to prove anything.

245
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:37,313
I just don't want
what I'm about to say to be recorded.

246
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,193
I don't believe you.

247
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,110
Open the door!

248
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,954
Everybody out! Get out now!

249
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,190
Everyone, Erin.

250
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,556
Unless you tell me the whole truth,

251
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:33,394
that deal you made to save your son is over
and he goes to prison.

252
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:36,517
You can't do that.
The president signed an agreement.

253
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:40,718
If that gets in the way of protecting this
country, you think he'll stand behind it?

254
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:45,715
He's gonna tear it up and your son
goes to prison for the rest of his life.

255
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,314
And I know a little something about prison.

256
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,436
Based on the conditions of his confinement,

257
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:54,399
I give Behrooz three months
before he commits suicide.

258
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,109
And by the way,
I'm gonna make it my personal mission

259
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:03,797
to make sure you never hear word one
about what happens to him, ever.

260
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,471
Wait.

261
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:25,279
Habib Marwan is the man
our cell reported to in the United States.

262
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,670
You said your cell.
How many other cells reported to him?

263
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:31,877
- I don't know.
- But there are others?

264
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,152
- Yes.
- How many?

265
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:39,109
I told you, I don't know.
The cells are not in contact with one another.

266
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,555
Marwan thought it was safer that way.

267
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:45,030
What about the override?
Is it in his possession right now?

268
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,429
- Definitely.
- Why definitely?

269
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:51,957
Your programmers are trying to interfere
with the meltdown sequence.

270
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,952
Marwan is the only one
capable of stopping them.

271
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,952
- He's controlling it directly?
- Exactly.

272
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:00,554
Where? Where?

273
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,949
Somewhere in downtown.

274
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:06,157
The Rockland building?

275
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,515
Yes.

276
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,600
- <i>Sarah Gavin. </i>
- Get me Jack Bauer on the phone.

277
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,875
<i>You got it. </i>

278
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,836
Place her back in holding.

279
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:26,277
Dina just confirmed. Marwan's got
the override. He's at the Rockland building.

280
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,157
Everyone, listen up.

281
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:33,633
The address where Curtis is and where Jack
is heading is the location of the override.

282
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:37,713
I want every station to focus on this location.
I want field teams ready.

283
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:43,158
Rework your assault tactics on the building
factoring in this new information.

284
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:49,032
- <i> Let me speak to Tony. </i>
- Hold on a second. Tony, I've got Jack.

285
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,439
- Jack.
- Yeah?

286
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:54,069
Marwan has the override.
He's at the address you're headed to.

287
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:58,153
- What about Curtis?
- No, we haven't been able to reach him yet.

288
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,038
- Have you changed the assault profiles?
- We're working on it.

289
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:04,032
Marwan can't know we're coming
or he'll take off.

290
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:07,271
Also, we have about 20 minutes
before the plants melt down.

291
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,955
Tell Castle to prep for a low-profile assault.
I'm on my way.

292
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:13,793
Copy that. Get me Castle.

293
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,197
Ali.

294
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,555
Go.

295
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:25,076
- Have you found him?
- It was not necessary for you to come down.

296
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,958
- Not necessary?
- We will find him.

297
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,873
If I'm captured, it'll end all we've worked for.

298
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,837
He can't get far.

299
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,434
Don't tell me that.
He's killed two of our men.

300
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,875
What is it, Forbes?

301
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,475
- Tell me you've got him.
- <i>No, I'm sorry. He may have gotten away. </i>

302
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:47,597
How is that possible?
Ali says the floor is locked off.

303
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,557
I know, we're still searching,

304
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:53,349
but we've got to deal with ventilation,
air ducts, ceiling space...

305
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,910
I don't care how you get him,
as long as he's contained.

306
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,275
I need 30 minutes.
Can you make that happen?

307
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,679
I can make it happen.

308
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,556
30 minutes.

309
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,988
Who's Marwan?

310
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:18,593
Who is he? Does he have the override?

311
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:26,676
Does he have the override?

312
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:29,069
- Yes.
- Where is he?

313
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,516
Where is he?

314
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,670
One flight up.

315
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:37,558
I don't have access to the floor.

316
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:57,677
- <i>CTU, Sarah Gavin. </i>
- Sarah, it's Curtis. Where's Driscoll?

317
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,389
- Where have you been?
- I'm still in the Rockland building. Listen.

318
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:04,677
Marianne's dead.
I'm sure our backup teams are dead too.

319
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:07,638
- The override is here.
- Jack's on his way to you now.

320
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:26,757
- Jack.
- I need you to put together a security detail.

321
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,671
I'll take care of it.

322
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,796
I want you to stay here until I get back.

323
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,757
- Are you going in?
- Yeah.

324
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,151
Just a second.

325
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,834
- This is Bauer.
- Jack, it's Manning.

326
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:41,992
- Where are you?
- 29th floor. Where are you?

327
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,755
At the staging area a block away.
Have you secured the override?

328
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,957
No, but it's here.
A man named Marwan is in control.

329
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,793
I know, CTU got a profile.
What's your mobility?

330
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:55,270
Limited. They're looking for me.
I took an access card off them.

331
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,476
- How do we meet?
- Take the main elevator.

332
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:00,916
- There's only one guard. I'll take care of him.
- I'm on my way.

333
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,754
They've got Marwan boxed in.
Send your team. Reinforce the perimeter.

334
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:09,152
I want men on the first floor
in case this thing goes hot.

335
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,355
I'll be right back.

336
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:27,718
Go! Go!

337
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:43,958
That was our field agent from the Rockland
building. Your daughter's with him.

338
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:49,239
- I don't want her anywhere near harm's way.
- She won't be, sir.

339
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,710
- <i>Are we closing in on the override?</i>
We hope so.

340
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,837
- We believe we've found where it is.
- <i>Which is where?</i>

341
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,638
In an office in LA.

342
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:14,113
We think the terrorists are either associated
with a tenant or they've created a corporation.

343
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:17,510
- <i>How is CTU proceeding?</i>
- We have teams converging.

344
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:22,037
Once we find the override we have to use it
to reprogram the reactors manually.

345
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:25,715
- <i>Will there be enough time?</i>
- Our people will be ready once we find it.

346
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:31,557
<i>All right. I don't have to remind</i>
<i>both of you of the consequences if we fail. </i>

347
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:35,076
Everyone here
understands what's at stake, sir.

348
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:39,353
<i> Ms Driscoll,</i>
<i>Dr Sanford's on line two. </i>

349
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,034
Excuse me, sir.

350
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,714
I'll meet you on the floor.

351
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,508
Yes, Doctor?

352
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:53,149
- <i>Sorry to bother you. Maya's acting out again. </i>
- What is she doing?

353
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:56,516
She's being abusive to my staff,
she's broken a few things.

354
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:01,515
If she doesn't settle I'll have to move her
to a private hospital. We can't handle her.

355
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:05,878
All right, don't do anything.
I'll be right there.

356
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,470
- Sarah.
- Excuse me.

357
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:18,154
- Is Edgar still on line with NRC?
- Yes.

358
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,755
- Find any other ways to stop the meltdowns?
- Not without the override.

359
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:26,072
- What's happening at the Rockland building?
- Castle's teams are on the perimeter.

360
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:29,391
- What about Curtis?
- He's about to meet up with Jack inside.

361
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,152
- Where are you working?
- Station three.

362
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:35,518
I'll be there in a few minutes.
Call me if Jack or Curtis get the override.

363
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,397
OK.

364
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:43,991
- You're a cruel person, do you know that?
- Maya, please!

365
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,594
This is a restricted area.
You must stay in bed.

366
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:49,399
Stay in bed? What am I? A baby?

367
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,879
Maya!

368
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,428
- What do you want, Mother?
- Don't!

369
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,876
Please don't
treat these people disrespectfully.

370
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,430
Please don't tell me what to do!

371
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:05,954
I'll stop telling you what to do
when you stop behaving like a child.

372
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:08,873
- What?
- You heard me.

373
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:14,510
There are other people in this world
besides you and they have problems too.

374
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:19,754
Now, are you gonna get a grip on yourself,
or do I have to call security to restrain you?

375
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:24,277
- You're pathetic, you know that?
- I will not allow you to talk to me like this.

376
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:28,114
- I will not!
- What are you gonna do about it?

377
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,237
I...

378
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:43,352
I just want to get out of here, Mommy.

379
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,239
And I will take you home.

380
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:53,035
But I have something I have to finish first.

381
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,917
No.

382
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,355
OK?

383
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,635
Yeah.

384
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,836
Are we clear?

385
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,273
Yeah.

386
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,157
Good.

387
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,750
That's my girl.

388
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:40,039
We got a man down. Take the wall.

389
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,117
- You OK?
- Yeah.

390
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,749
I overheard a phone conversation.
We have less than 15 minutes.

391
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:55,434
- How many are still alive?
- At least four.

392
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:59,957
- Have your men secure the floor. Which way?
- This way.

393
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:04,033
- What about backup?
- No. We can't let Marwan know we're coming.

394
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,873
- What's upstairs?
- IDS Data Systems.

395
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,713
Marwan's cell must have inserted a sleeper.

396
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:12,758
And used their servers
to download the virus to the plants.

397
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,354
- By piggybacking on IDS hardware.
- Yeah.

398
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:18,477
- Take the door.
- All right.

399
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,629
Clear.

400
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,310
Step away from the door, ma'am.

401
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:03,631
I need you to exit the building.
It's an emergency.

402
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,233
- You ready?
- Yeah.

403
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,311
Let's go.

404
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:23,319
- Did we get a description on him?
- No.

405
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,110
He could be anyone.

406
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,955
What's up? What's going on?

407
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,030
Hold it!

408
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:31,716
- Yes?
- Marwan, it's Ali. We've been discovered!

409
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,553
Ali?

410
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:42,595
- Make sure all the exits are covered.
- Roger that.

411
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,514
Last man down.

412
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,392
Curtis!

413
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:31,829
Stay down!

414
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,639
Stay down! Get down! Get out of the way!

415
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,439
Stay where you are! Stay down!

416
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,715
- I got this exit!
- You got him?

417
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,711
No!

418
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:46,832
- Jack, I have the override!
- Secure it!

419
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:50,472
Call CTU now! Now!

420
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:54,199
I got him!

421
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,832
- Driscoll.
- <i>Erin, I have the override. Put Edgar on. </i>

422
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:03,388
Edgar! Line one. Curtis has the override.

423
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:06,153
- Edgar Stiles. Is the override logged in?
- Yes.

424
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,629
Send it to channel 11.

425
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,872
- I can't.
- What do you mean?

426
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,554
- The fields are write protected.
- That can't be.

427
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:16,552
If you're plugged in
you should be able to do what you want.

428
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,551
It's locked. What do you want me to do?

429
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:21,279
- The clinic called.
- Tell them to wait.

430
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:24,318
- They said it was...
- Tell them!

431
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,509
If you're gonna do something, do it now.

432
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:30,637
Marwan must have modified
the override to do this.

433
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,393
The NRC screen shows
the meltdown is beginning.

434
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:36,153
- Edgar, do something.
- There must be a hot key.

435
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:39,630
There's a lot of keys.
I can't just try random combinations.

436
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,597
Press the function keys.

437
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:45,229
<i>The status window will light up</i>
<i>when you get to an active one. </i>

438
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:48,551
- F5.
- <i>Good. Hold it down and press escape. </i>

439
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,238
- Nothing.
- Try F5, shift, escape.

440
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:57,832
- OK, it's responding.
- Good. Send it to channel 11. Hurry up.

441
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:02,710
Edgar, now they have three plants
in meltdown initiation.

442
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:16,832
- Did you get it?
- I hope so.

443
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:29,032
It's starting to respond.

444
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:39,309
Yes! Yes!

445
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:43,188
The temperature is dropping
in all remaining power plants.

446
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,633
Good work.

447
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:52,231
- Congratulations, Edgar.
Yeah! Whoo! Congratulations.

448
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:00,837
- Great work, Erin.
- Thank you, sir.

449
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,672
Excuse me.

450
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,712
Maya?

451
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,597
Where is she?

452
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,955

00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:41,549
Oh! Oh!

454
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,551
Oh, baby!

455
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,956
Oh!

456
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:02,076
<i>It's over, sir. </i>

457
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:05,152
<i>We've stopped the meltdown. </i>

458
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:07,356
Congratulations, Mr President.

459
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,829
Well done.

00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,836
This is Bauer. We've got a man down.

00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:38,789
Marwan is in the northwest stairwell headed
to ground level. Does anybody read me?

462
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:42,190
<i> Jack, it's Castle. I'll get a man up there. </i>

463
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:56,758
Son of a bitch! All CTU agents,
Marwan is impersonating a CTU officer.

464
00:40:56,840 --> 00:41:00,628
<i>I repeat, the suspect</i>
<i>is impersonating a CTU officer. </i>

465
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,916
<i> Solarz, do you read me?</i>

466
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,832
<i>Solarz, do you read me?</i>
