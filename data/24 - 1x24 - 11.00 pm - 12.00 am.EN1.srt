00:00:13,333 --> 00:00:18,566
(Jack) Right now, terrorists are plotting
to assassinate a presidential candidate.

2
00:00:18,653 --> 00:00:21,121
My wife and daughter have been targeted.

3
00:00:21,213 --> 00:00:25,286
And people that l work with
may be involved in both.

4
00:00:25,373 --> 00:00:30,925
l'm Federal Agent Jack Bauer,
and today is the longest day of my life.

5
00:00:33,893 --> 00:00:38,205
You must talk to Victor Drazen when he calls.
Listen to his demands and cooperate.

6
00:00:38,293 --> 00:00:40,523
Senator, please answer this phone.

7
00:00:41,413 --> 00:00:44,405
- This is David Palmer.
- Hello, Senator Palmer.

8
00:00:45,293 --> 00:00:46,487
Senator!

9
00:00:47,973 --> 00:00:50,168
We did it, Father. We did it.

10
00:00:52,533 --> 00:00:55,809
The man that planned the explosion
needs to believe it was a success.

11
00:00:55,893 --> 00:00:58,282
You want the world
to think that David is dead?

12
00:00:58,373 --> 00:01:00,603
- Yes, ma'am.
- Absolutely not.

13
00:01:00,693 --> 00:01:04,481
- David, what's this all about?
- His daughter is being held hostage.

14
00:01:04,573 --> 00:01:06,882
l'll take care of the girl. Then we can leave.

15
00:01:06,973 --> 00:01:11,842
Do not do anything until we know
Jack Bauer is dead as well. Nothing.

16
00:01:11,933 --> 00:01:14,970
l was calling to confirm your death,
but l see you've survived.

17
00:01:15,053 --> 00:01:17,044
l have an offer to make you.

18
00:01:17,133 --> 00:01:20,569
You've already killed Senator Palmer.
l'm the last person on your list.

19
00:01:20,653 --> 00:01:25,647
- l'll make you a trade. Me for my daughter.
- Come to Port of Los Angeles. Dock 11A.

20
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:29,642
(Kim) Do you mind if l have some coffee?

21
00:01:30,733 --> 00:01:33,452
(Andre) Stop right there, Kim! Don't move.

22
00:01:34,773 --> 00:01:37,241
(speaks Serbian)

23
00:01:40,813 --> 00:01:42,804
(phone rings)

24
00:01:43,413 --> 00:01:45,210
(in Serbian)

25
00:02:29,253 --> 00:02:31,244
(voices speaking Serbian)

26
00:02:45,693 --> 00:02:47,684
(phone rings)

27
00:03:10,133 --> 00:03:13,091
Maybe you're right. Maybe she drowned.

28
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:17,725
lt does not matter, as long as
Bauer believes his daughter is here.

29
00:03:52,573 --> 00:03:55,690
- (horn blares)
- Stop! Stop, please!

30
00:03:57,253 --> 00:03:59,448
At this time, we do not have any information

31
00:03:59,533 --> 00:04:03,651
as to the cause of the explosion
that killed Senator David Palmer.

32
00:04:14,533 --> 00:04:16,967
Do you have any idea
what's going on out there?

33
00:04:17,053 --> 00:04:21,251
Since no one has seen a body,
the media's circulating all kinds of rumours.

34
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:26,487
Look, l will tell them as soon as l have
confirmation that Bauer's daughter is safe.

35
00:04:26,573 --> 00:04:29,212
And then what, David?
You're gonna play dead?

36
00:04:29,293 --> 00:04:32,490
And l'm supposed to hide in here
and play the grieving widow?

37
00:04:32,573 --> 00:04:35,406
Just how long do you think
we can keep that charade up?

38
00:04:35,493 --> 00:04:38,803
- For as long as we have to.
- Well, that's crazy! lt's...

39
00:04:38,893 --> 00:04:41,453
Mike, tell him how crazy it is.
He listens to you.

40
00:04:41,533 --> 00:04:45,048
- Don't put me in the middle of it.
- lsn't that your job? To be in the middle?

41
00:04:45,133 --> 00:04:48,762
For crying out loud, Mike.
lt's your career on the line too.

42
00:04:49,653 --> 00:04:55,091
OK. You came clean on TV today.
You got lucky.

43
00:04:55,173 --> 00:04:58,085
But it could just as easily
have gone the other way.

44
00:04:58,373 --> 00:05:02,651
Testing the public's patience like that?
You won't be lucky again, David.

45
00:05:02,733 --> 00:05:04,724
Listen to me.

46
00:05:05,613 --> 00:05:07,888
Jack Bauer saved my life today.

47
00:05:07,973 --> 00:05:11,682
- Not once, but twice.
- Yes, l realise that.

48
00:05:11,773 --> 00:05:14,924
- And l am sympathetic to what he's going...
- l don't think you are.

49
00:05:15,013 --> 00:05:18,801
- David, l am. Listen to me.
- No. l am going to respect his request.

50
00:05:18,893 --> 00:05:22,249
And so are you.
You will not sacrifice his daughter.

51
00:05:43,493 --> 00:05:44,687
Anything new?

52
00:05:44,773 --> 00:05:47,606
- l'm going over the intel from Langley.
- l mean about Jack.

53
00:05:47,693 --> 00:05:50,730
- CTU, Almeida.
- l assume you still haven't heard from him?

54
00:05:50,813 --> 00:05:52,485
- (Tony) You sure?
- No. Not yet.

55
00:05:52,573 --> 00:05:57,010
George? l got Highway Patrol on line seven.
They picked up a girl at Port of Los Angeles.

56
00:05:57,093 --> 00:05:59,891
- Says she's Jack's daughter.
- Patch it through.

57
00:06:03,773 --> 00:06:08,051
- This is Mason, CTU. Who am l speaking to?
- Sergeant Devlin, Highway Patrol.

58
00:06:08,133 --> 00:06:11,887
- You have a young woman with you?
- She claims to be the daughter of an agent.

59
00:06:11,973 --> 00:06:13,964
- Jack Bauer?
- That's right.

60
00:06:14,053 --> 00:06:16,089
Can l speak with her, please?

61
00:06:19,053 --> 00:06:22,204
- Hello?
- Kim, this is George Mason at CTU.

62
00:06:22,293 --> 00:06:25,330
- How are you? OK?
- Yeah. You gotta tell my father l've escaped.

63
00:06:25,413 --> 00:06:29,406
- He'll go back there and they'll kill him.
- Can you tell us where these people are?

64
00:06:29,493 --> 00:06:31,688
The port. l... l don't know exactly.

65
00:06:31,773 --> 00:06:34,446
- May l speak with the sergeant again?
- OK.

66
00:06:35,293 --> 00:06:40,083
- Yeah. We picked her up near Dock 11 Alpha.
- Send two tactical teams, highest priority.

67
00:06:40,173 --> 00:06:42,403
Have law enforcement
establish a perimeter.

68
00:06:42,493 --> 00:06:45,132
- Where are you now?
- Just north of the harbour.

69
00:06:45,213 --> 00:06:48,205
All right. Get Kim over here ASAP, all right?

70
00:06:48,293 --> 00:06:50,727
We gotta find Jack
before he walks into a trap.

71
00:06:50,813 --> 00:06:52,405
We need to coordinate two...

72
00:06:52,493 --> 00:06:54,484
Let's go.

73
00:06:56,453 --> 00:06:58,330
Let's roll.

74
00:08:01,413 --> 00:08:03,404
(phone rings)

75
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:12,767
- Yeah?
- (Andre) What's taking so long?

76
00:08:12,853 --> 00:08:15,970
- l just got here.
- Where exactly?

77
00:08:16,053 --> 00:08:18,806
Don't worry, l'm close enough.
Where's my daughter?

78
00:08:18,893 --> 00:08:21,566
- Right here.
- Put her on the phone.

79
00:08:21,653 --> 00:08:25,692
Come to the parking lot of the freight office.
l'll come out with her.

80
00:08:25,773 --> 00:08:28,765
- Let me speak to her first.
- There's been enough talking.

81
00:08:28,853 --> 00:08:31,447
After what's happened,
you expect me to trust you?

82
00:08:31,533 --> 00:08:35,572
You lied to us about Palmer being dead,
so don't talk to me about trust, all right?

83
00:08:35,653 --> 00:08:39,328
Get down here now
or l'll kill her myself. Trust that.

84
00:08:39,413 --> 00:08:43,042
l'm not gonna show myself
until l speak to my daughter first.

85
00:08:44,013 --> 00:08:46,891
Don't test me. Bauer!

86
00:08:50,973 --> 00:08:54,522
- He's not coming.
- He's coming.

87
00:09:02,293 --> 00:09:04,727
Nina, what's the ETA on the tac teams?

88
00:09:04,813 --> 00:09:07,691
Five on the alpha, eight on the beta.

89
00:09:08,053 --> 00:09:10,567
- lt doesn't matter. Stay on it.
- (phone rings)

90
00:09:12,773 --> 00:09:15,333
- Myers.
- (Jack) Nina, it's me.

91
00:09:15,413 --> 00:09:17,927
- Where are you?
- Listen carefully.

92
00:09:18,013 --> 00:09:22,529
l've just confirmed that someone at CTU
is feeding the Drazens information.

93
00:09:22,613 --> 00:09:25,605
- Based on what?
- They know Palmer wasn't killed in the blast.

94
00:09:25,693 --> 00:09:28,366
Who at CTU had clearance
for that kind of intel?

95
00:09:28,453 --> 00:09:33,129
- Besides me, just Tony, Mason and Chapelle.
- One of those three is working for them.

96
00:09:33,213 --> 00:09:35,773
You need to find out which one.

97
00:09:35,853 --> 00:09:38,242
Jack, what are you doing? Where are you?

98
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:41,052
Andre agreed to a trade. Me for Kim.

99
00:09:42,533 --> 00:09:46,845
- Are you gonna just walk right up to them?
- lf l can guarantee Kim's safety, yes.

100
00:09:46,933 --> 00:09:50,164
Nina, there's a chance
l won't be able to see this thing through.

101
00:09:50,253 --> 00:09:55,885
Until you find out who's giving the Drazens
information, don't trust anyone. l gotta go.

102
00:10:15,093 --> 00:10:17,527
Come on, Andre, show your hand.

103
00:10:22,813 --> 00:10:25,964
l don't think the situation
will require much spin,

104
00:10:26,053 --> 00:10:29,284
as long as you do
what you've been doing all along.

105
00:10:29,373 --> 00:10:33,412
- Tell me again what l've been doing, Mike.
- Telling the truth.

106
00:10:33,493 --> 00:10:35,370
Oh, yeah.

107
00:10:37,133 --> 00:10:40,682
And tearing my family apart in the process.

108
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:43,162
As hard as it's been for everyone,

109
00:10:43,253 --> 00:10:47,485
l think this last day has been about
finding out who you really are.

110
00:10:48,373 --> 00:10:50,364
And not just as a candidate.

111
00:10:53,493 --> 00:10:55,484
(phone rings)

112
00:10:56,653 --> 00:10:59,042
- Yeah?
- Mike, turn on the television.

113
00:11:00,293 --> 00:11:02,409
- (sighs)
- What is it, Mike?

114
00:11:05,293 --> 00:11:08,046
A reliable source from inside
Senator Palmer's campaign

115
00:11:08,133 --> 00:11:11,762
confirmedjust moments ago
that the senator was indeed unharmed

116
00:11:11,853 --> 00:11:14,606
- by the blast reported here over an hour ago.
- Dammit!

117
00:11:14,693 --> 00:11:18,686
What is still uncertain is why
the senator has not made a statement

118
00:11:18,773 --> 00:11:20,923
- and how the rumour ofhis death...
- Sherry.

119
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:24,449
David. We have to deal with the press. David!

120
00:11:25,173 --> 00:11:27,164
David!

121
00:11:27,973 --> 00:11:30,771
- You couldn't wait to leak it to the press.
- David, l...

122
00:11:30,853 --> 00:11:35,449
- lt was you. What were you thinking?
- They already knew.

123
00:11:35,533 --> 00:11:37,763
Dammit, Sherry!
The way you keep defying me!

124
00:11:37,853 --> 00:11:41,562
- l'm not defying you! l am protecting you!
- Protecting me from what?

125
00:11:41,653 --> 00:11:44,008
- Mike!
- Back off, David. l mean it.

126
00:11:44,093 --> 00:11:45,526
- Get off me!
- l mean it!

127
00:11:45,613 --> 00:11:47,331
- Get off me!
- Back off!

128
00:11:47,413 --> 00:11:50,883
David, you have to talk to the press now.

129
00:11:51,613 --> 00:11:55,049
The longer you take to make a statement,
the more control you give up.

130
00:11:55,133 --> 00:11:57,727
- Come on.
- Dammit, if that child dies...

131
00:12:24,573 --> 00:12:26,564
(Nina dials phone)

132
00:12:30,453 --> 00:12:32,125
- Yes?
- lt's me.

133
00:12:32,213 --> 00:12:34,283
- What is it?
- They found his daughter.

134
00:12:34,373 --> 00:12:36,364
She'll be here within the hour.

135
00:12:36,453 --> 00:12:38,728
(sighs)

136
00:12:38,813 --> 00:12:40,929
- Does Bauer know?
- No. Not yet.

137
00:12:41,013 --> 00:12:45,450
l'm the only one who's in contact with him.
l've been ordered to send in two teams.

138
00:12:45,533 --> 00:12:48,001
- They're on their way.
- Right. Hold on.

139
00:12:48,093 --> 00:12:52,291
They found the girl. Bauer doesn't know,
but the CTU people are on their way.

140
00:12:52,373 --> 00:12:54,887
We have to get you out of here.

141
00:12:54,973 --> 00:12:58,761
He won't come if we can't produce the girl.
He's not stupid.

142
00:12:58,853 --> 00:13:01,242
We just have time
to get to international waters.

143
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:04,291
l can't risk you getting captured again.

144
00:13:04,373 --> 00:13:06,409
Give me the phone.

145
00:13:09,013 --> 00:13:11,447
Can you contact Bauer?

146
00:13:11,533 --> 00:13:13,603
Yes.

147
00:13:14,253 --> 00:13:19,407
Tell him his daughter's dead.
Her body was found floating in the harbour.

148
00:13:19,493 --> 00:13:22,451
- You think he'll come after you?
- Yes.

149
00:13:23,373 --> 00:13:25,728
You'll have to kill him. No mistakes.

150
00:13:25,813 --> 00:13:28,532
lf he finds out l've lied to him,
my cover will be blown.

151
00:13:28,613 --> 00:13:31,605
Of course we will kill him. That is the point.

152
00:13:34,533 --> 00:13:37,206
He is coming.

153
00:13:38,573 --> 00:13:40,962
- (phone rings)
- Andre?

154
00:13:41,053 --> 00:13:44,045
No. lt's me.
l think you should come back to CTU.

155
00:13:44,133 --> 00:13:47,728
l can't. l'm running out of time.
l'm going in to get Kim now.

156
00:13:47,813 --> 00:13:51,692
- l don't know how to tell you this, Jack.
- What is it, Nina?

157
00:13:51,773 --> 00:13:53,843
Nina, what is it?

158
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:57,403
A coastguard cutter answered
the APB we put out on Kim.

159
00:13:57,493 --> 00:13:59,484
- They found her body, Jack.
- What?

160
00:13:59,573 --> 00:14:02,133
l'm sorry. She's dead.

161
00:14:03,733 --> 00:14:06,850
- No.
- Jack, l'm so sorry. l know... Jack?

162
00:14:08,293 --> 00:14:10,284
Jack?

163
00:15:41,653 --> 00:15:43,689
(speaking in Serbian)

164
00:15:50,133 --> 00:15:54,524
What if Bauer doesn't come? He may be too
crushed by the thought his daughter is dead.

165
00:15:54,613 --> 00:15:57,047
That is exactly why he will come.

166
00:15:57,733 --> 00:15:59,610
Believe me. l know.

167
00:16:21,653 --> 00:16:24,087
Go! Go! Hurry, Father. Get to the boat.

168
00:17:55,133 --> 00:17:56,327
Agh!

169
00:17:57,573 --> 00:17:58,926
(gun clicks)

170
00:18:32,053 --> 00:18:34,123
(gun clicks)

171
00:19:15,093 --> 00:19:20,121
(Palmer) lt has come to my attention that
some misinformation was given to the press.

172
00:19:20,213 --> 00:19:24,809
And, again, l apologise
for the misunderstanding.

173
00:19:24,893 --> 00:19:28,329
As you can imagine,
this has been a very chaotic situation.

174
00:19:28,413 --> 00:19:34,249
But l appreciate the confidence the voters
have continued to show for our campaign.

175
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:38,246
We regret that false information has
been broadcast regarding this incident.

176
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:41,006
But, thankfully, no one was hurt.

177
00:19:41,493 --> 00:19:44,212
My family and l are safe,
and we have no intention

178
00:19:44,293 --> 00:19:47,126
ofletting this slow us down in any way.

179
00:19:50,813 --> 00:19:54,442
- Did you come in here to lecture me, Mike?
- Lecture you on what?

180
00:19:54,533 --> 00:19:57,923
About how l'm not being
supportive enough of David.

181
00:19:58,893 --> 00:20:01,965
Actually, l'm on your side this time.

182
00:20:02,053 --> 00:20:05,841
l think David was hurting himself
with this charade.

183
00:20:06,773 --> 00:20:10,163
Maybe it's good
you leaked the truth to the press.

184
00:20:13,293 --> 00:20:17,844
l wanna know what this entire day
has done to his campaign.

185
00:20:18,613 --> 00:20:21,889
l think we should run some focus groups
first thing in the morning.

186
00:20:21,973 --> 00:20:24,282
l've already called Robin over at ASl.

187
00:20:24,373 --> 00:20:29,447
OK. Good. Do you think David should cancel
his trip to Dallas, go back to Washington?

188
00:20:29,533 --> 00:20:31,524
l don't know, Sherry.

189
00:20:32,693 --> 00:20:36,242
l think... David should make that call.

190
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:40,372
Oh, no. l don't. David's in no frame of mind
to make critical decisions right now.

191
00:20:40,453 --> 00:20:43,889
lt's gonna take you and l
to steer this thing by ourselves, OK?

192
00:20:43,973 --> 00:20:46,965
Until he gets his head screwed on right.

193
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:50,004
Listen, Sherry.

194
00:20:50,093 --> 00:20:53,403
David wanted to meet you privately
when he finished his statement.

195
00:20:53,493 --> 00:20:57,805
David doesn't need to make an appointment
to see me, Mike. l'm right here.

196
00:20:57,893 --> 00:21:00,407
He'll be in the ballroom in five minutes.

197
00:21:00,493 --> 00:21:02,848
l've already called the Secret Service.

198
00:21:04,933 --> 00:21:07,242
What... what's this all about?

199
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:10,370
He didn't say. lf l were you...

200
00:21:11,893 --> 00:21:16,091
l'd take it as an opportunity
to make the first move...

201
00:21:17,653 --> 00:21:21,248
to patch things up, make things right, Sherry.

202
00:21:25,893 --> 00:21:28,009
Fine, Mike.

203
00:21:37,373 --> 00:21:40,171
(Mason) lt's too much. Tony, get this.

204
00:21:40,253 --> 00:21:43,006
l'll call you back.
Tac team gets there. Jack didn't wait.

205
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:45,004
- He went in without 'em.
- By himself?

206
00:21:45,093 --> 00:21:46,367
- Evidently.
- ls he all right?

207
00:21:46,453 --> 00:21:49,172
- He's alive.
- What about the Drazens?

208
00:21:49,253 --> 00:21:51,642
- What are you talking about?
- Dead.

209
00:21:53,733 --> 00:21:57,169
Congratulations, Teri. Your family's fine.
They're on their way here.

210
00:21:57,253 --> 00:22:01,610
Anyway, Karris counts seven down.
Jack's the last man standing.

211
00:22:01,693 --> 00:22:05,481
- Contact Secret Service. l'll update Division.
- l talked to Jack an hour ago.

212
00:22:05,573 --> 00:22:08,292
- He said he was on his way to get Kim.
- Everybody's fine.

213
00:22:08,373 --> 00:22:10,682
Now go in there and celebrate. Relax.

214
00:22:58,733 --> 00:23:00,689
Nina?

215
00:23:11,493 --> 00:23:13,211
Can l help you?

216
00:23:25,373 --> 00:23:26,123
(woman) Ja?

217
00:23:26,213 --> 00:23:27,692
(in German)

218
00:23:31,453 --> 00:23:33,444
(Nina speaks German)

219
00:23:44,973 --> 00:23:47,407
- Just call me when it's time.
- Someone is there?

220
00:23:47,493 --> 00:23:49,609
- Yes.
- l understand.

221
00:23:49,693 --> 00:23:52,207
- You speak German?
- Frankfurt Division.

222
00:23:52,893 --> 00:23:55,327
- Something wrong?
- Yeah.

223
00:23:55,413 --> 00:23:59,611
l heard there was some big shoot-out.
l can't get anyone to tell me what's going on.

224
00:23:59,693 --> 00:24:04,244
Teri, calm down. Jack and Kim are fine.
They're on their way here right now.

225
00:24:05,413 --> 00:24:07,131
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

226
00:24:07,213 --> 00:24:09,773
- And the men that were after Kim and me?
- They're dead.

227
00:24:09,853 --> 00:24:11,889
You and Kim are completely safe.

228
00:24:11,973 --> 00:24:14,203
- And so is Jack.
- OK.

229
00:24:14,293 --> 00:24:17,524
l just want us all to be back together again.

230
00:24:17,613 --> 00:24:19,604
lt won't be long.

231
00:24:20,173 --> 00:24:22,687
- Thank God.
- (phone rings)

232
00:24:23,413 --> 00:24:27,565
l'm sorry, l still have a lot of work to do.
So if there's nothing else...

233
00:24:27,653 --> 00:24:29,769
There is, actually. Um...

234
00:24:30,613 --> 00:24:33,002
This is a little awkward, Nina, but...

235
00:24:34,013 --> 00:24:36,652
lt's my guess that you still
have feelings for Jack,

236
00:24:36,733 --> 00:24:40,169
and now that we're together again
and we're going to have a baby...

237
00:24:40,253 --> 00:24:45,964
Teri... As soon as this is over, l plan
to have myself tranferred out of this office.

238
00:24:47,293 --> 00:24:49,284
- Really?
- Yes.

239
00:24:49,853 --> 00:24:52,321
- Oh, Nina, l'm sorry...
- No need to apologise.

240
00:24:52,413 --> 00:24:55,246
lf anything, l appreciate your being honest.

241
00:24:59,973 --> 00:25:02,362
- This is Myers.
- You're still not alone?

242
00:25:02,453 --> 00:25:05,013
- That's right.
- Listen carefully.

243
00:25:05,093 --> 00:25:08,244
Procedures are in place.
Collect all ofyour information.

244
00:25:08,333 --> 00:25:10,893
- We have arranged foryour extraction.
- Where?

245
00:25:10,973 --> 00:25:13,806
The usual pick-up point. Northwest corner.

246
00:25:14,693 --> 00:25:17,207
- ls there anything else?
- No. l know you're busy.

247
00:25:17,293 --> 00:25:19,363
l'm gonna let you get back to work.

248
00:25:27,093 --> 00:25:29,607
l can't let you go.

249
00:25:32,453 --> 00:25:34,808
Not yet.

250
00:25:34,893 --> 00:25:36,884
Move back into the room. Slowly.

251
00:25:38,333 --> 00:25:40,563
l said move!

252
00:25:44,173 --> 00:25:46,528
Against the wall.

253
00:25:46,613 --> 00:25:48,808
On your knees. Do it!

254
00:26:00,933 --> 00:26:02,924
Officer!

255
00:26:04,933 --> 00:26:08,528
The body that you guys pulled out
of the harbour. lt was my daughter.

256
00:26:08,613 --> 00:26:12,322
- l'd like to claim the body.
- Not sure what you're referring to.

257
00:26:12,893 --> 00:26:15,612
The coastguard.
They pulled a body out of the harbour.

258
00:26:15,693 --> 00:26:18,651
- ln the last hour?
- l didn't hear anything. l just got on duty.

259
00:26:18,733 --> 00:26:22,487
- lf you'd like, l can call the harbour master.
- Hold on one second.

260
00:26:22,573 --> 00:26:24,768
Give me your phone.

261
00:26:27,213 --> 00:26:31,525
- Could you call him now, please?
- Yeah, sure.

262
00:26:31,973 --> 00:26:34,009
- Harbour master's office.
- Hey, Frank.

263
00:26:34,093 --> 00:26:36,288
Did you pull a body
out of the harbour tonight?

264
00:26:36,373 --> 00:26:39,092
- Uh, no. Nothing on our patrol.
- Are you sure?

265
00:26:39,173 --> 00:26:41,403
- No reports anywhere.
- All right. Roger that.

266
00:26:41,493 --> 00:26:45,372
- What did he say?
- No body was found in the harbour or near it.

267
00:26:45,453 --> 00:26:47,648
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

268
00:26:47,733 --> 00:26:49,849
ls it possible another unit picked her up?

269
00:26:49,933 --> 00:26:53,892
We cover 50 miles of coastline.
There was no body found tonight.

270
00:26:55,093 --> 00:26:57,049
Thanks. Thank you.

271
00:27:24,293 --> 00:27:26,284
(phone rings)

272
00:27:26,813 --> 00:27:28,690
- This is Mason.
- Hey, it's Jack.

273
00:27:28,773 --> 00:27:31,651
Shall l congratulate you
or demand your resignation?

274
00:27:31,773 --> 00:27:34,810
- Do you know where my daughter is?
- As a matter of fact l do.

275
00:27:34,893 --> 00:27:38,203
Highway Patrol picked her up
half an hour ago. She's heading here now.

276
00:27:38,293 --> 00:27:42,571
- lf you'd called, l could have told you.
- You need to arrest Nina.

277
00:27:42,653 --> 00:27:44,450
- What?
- She's working against us.

278
00:27:44,533 --> 00:27:48,242
- Don't let her out of the building.
- Jack, hold on. What's all this about?

279
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,847
She told me that
the coastguard found Kim's body.

280
00:27:50,933 --> 00:27:53,811
l confirmed with them
they never found a body tonight.

281
00:27:53,893 --> 00:27:56,361
She was working with the Drazens
to set a trap for me.

282
00:27:56,453 --> 00:27:58,569
Are you sure it wasn't a misunderstanding?

283
00:27:58,653 --> 00:28:01,963
About Kim being dead? No, she lied.
There was no misunderstanding.

284
00:28:02,053 --> 00:28:04,487
lt doesn't sound like there's any proof either.

285
00:28:04,573 --> 00:28:08,805
l'll get you your proof.
Just don't let her out of your sight.

286
00:28:18,253 --> 00:28:20,244
(Jack dials phone)

287
00:28:21,813 --> 00:28:23,804
(phone rings)

288
00:28:24,413 --> 00:28:26,927
- Archives. Wilson.
- Hey, Paul. lt's Jack.

289
00:28:27,013 --> 00:28:31,529
l need a copy of the security tape from this
morning, between 8.50 and 9am in the lTS,

290
00:28:31,613 --> 00:28:34,411
when Jamey committed suicide in there.

291
00:28:34,493 --> 00:28:37,132
All right. Let me check.

292
00:28:41,333 --> 00:28:43,324
- That's weird.
- What, you got it?

293
00:28:43,413 --> 00:28:47,326
- Yes, sir. Except the tape was erased.
- When?

294
00:28:47,813 --> 00:28:49,610
- This morning.
- The digital backup?

295
00:28:49,693 --> 00:28:53,891
- There's no digital backup system for lTS.
- There is. You need the clearance code.

296
00:28:53,973 --> 00:28:56,248
Try C22717.

297
00:28:57,973 --> 00:29:00,965
- How long is this gonna take?
- Just a few minutes.

298
00:29:01,053 --> 00:29:03,726
OK. Get back to me as soon as you can.

299
00:29:05,413 --> 00:29:07,404
(horns blare)

300
00:29:14,293 --> 00:29:16,284
Wait a moment, please.

301
00:29:31,573 --> 00:29:34,087
David?

302
00:29:36,293 --> 00:29:38,488
Mike said you wanted to see me.

303
00:29:38,573 --> 00:29:40,564
Yes.

304
00:29:43,533 --> 00:29:45,524
l know we need to talk, but...

305
00:29:47,213 --> 00:29:51,968
Honestly, David, we haven't slept in two days.
Can't it wait till the morning?

306
00:30:02,613 --> 00:30:04,729
(Sherry) We've had a rough day.

307
00:30:10,613 --> 00:30:14,242
And, yes, l know that
you are very angry with me.

308
00:30:17,493 --> 00:30:20,291
But when we've put this day in perspective,

309
00:30:22,013 --> 00:30:26,803
you'll realise that l've been acting
in your best interest all along.

310
00:30:26,893 --> 00:30:31,091
- l'm not angry with you, Sherry.
- Oh, good, David.

311
00:30:33,573 --> 00:30:35,723
l feel sorry for you.

312
00:30:39,013 --> 00:30:41,481
You feel sorry for me?

313
00:30:44,773 --> 00:30:47,367
You've lost touch with what it is to be...

314
00:30:49,653 --> 00:30:51,530
a parent.

315
00:30:53,013 --> 00:30:54,969
A friend.

316
00:30:56,693 --> 00:30:58,684
A wife.

317
00:31:00,893 --> 00:31:02,645
What?

318
00:31:09,533 --> 00:31:11,524
After tonight...

319
00:31:13,253 --> 00:31:15,813
l don't wanna see you again.

320
00:31:17,373 --> 00:31:22,208
- David, will you just...
- Sherry, please. l've heard it all before.

321
00:31:26,093 --> 00:31:29,927
And l don't care
what this may do to my candidacy.

322
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:33,926
And it's not because
l don't wanna be president. l do.

323
00:31:38,773 --> 00:31:41,924
l just don't think you're fit to be the first lady.

324
00:31:43,733 --> 00:31:45,724
(sighs)

325
00:31:53,053 --> 00:31:56,443
Do you really think
that you can just leave me?

326
00:32:00,653 --> 00:32:04,328
Don't believe for a second
that it's gonna be that easy.

327
00:32:04,413 --> 00:32:08,884
Secret Service will take you back
to Washington whenever you're ready.

328
00:32:13,213 --> 00:32:15,329
David.

329
00:32:15,413 --> 00:32:18,485
David, you just don't walk away from me!

330
00:32:21,973 --> 00:32:24,362
David, you can't do this without me!

331
00:32:25,653 --> 00:32:28,087
David, l'm talking to you!

332
00:32:28,173 --> 00:32:31,085
- Sorry, ma'am.
- Get your hands off of me.

333
00:33:03,093 --> 00:33:06,165
- (phone rings)
- Yeah?

334
00:33:06,253 --> 00:33:09,689
lt's Wilson. l got the Jamey Farrell
interrogation footage foryou.

335
00:33:09,773 --> 00:33:13,083
Good. l've got a monitor in my car.
Upload it and send it to me.

336
00:33:13,173 --> 00:33:15,164
Yeah, sure thing.

337
00:33:30,413 --> 00:33:32,324
Oh, my God!

338
00:33:33,013 --> 00:33:36,926
Send this over to Mason. His eyes only.
Then patch me through to him.

339
00:33:37,013 --> 00:33:38,844
- (phone rings)
- Mason.

340
00:33:38,933 --> 00:33:41,322
l'm sending something.
Are you by your screen?

341
00:33:41,413 --> 00:33:44,769
- Yeah. What is it?
- Proof against Nina. She killed Jamey.

342
00:33:45,973 --> 00:33:48,009
- What? Why...
- Can you see it?

343
00:33:48,093 --> 00:33:50,084
Uh... yeah.

344
00:33:51,973 --> 00:33:53,292
Oh.

345
00:33:54,133 --> 00:33:57,921
This is unbelievable.
Where are you right now?

346
00:33:58,013 --> 00:34:00,686
- l'm about five minutes out.
- OK.

347
00:34:00,773 --> 00:34:03,287
Find her, George.

348
00:34:21,533 --> 00:34:23,524
(continuous beeping)

349
00:34:29,253 --> 00:34:31,528
- Where are you?
- l'm leaving now.

350
00:34:31,613 --> 00:34:33,888
You have 16 minutes
to reach the pick-up point.

351
00:34:33,973 --> 00:34:36,407
We're routing you through
Munich for three days.

352
00:34:36,493 --> 00:34:38,723
Why Germany?
Why can't l come to you directly?

353
00:34:38,813 --> 00:34:41,725
l don't know. These are the instructions.

354
00:34:41,813 --> 00:34:44,202
You'll need to be untraceable
during that time.

355
00:34:44,293 --> 00:34:47,126
Make sure nothing
can connectyou to Germany.

356
00:34:48,773 --> 00:34:51,367
- Didyou hear me?
- Yeah. All right.

357
00:34:54,653 --> 00:34:56,928
l'm leaving now, Teri.

358
00:34:57,013 --> 00:34:59,846
l'm gonna lock you in from the outside.

359
00:35:00,533 --> 00:35:02,444
Someone will find you soon.

360
00:35:03,373 --> 00:35:05,568
Everything will be fine.

361
00:35:10,773 --> 00:35:12,764
- Anything?
- Nothing.

362
00:35:33,493 --> 00:35:35,245
Miss Myers!

363
00:35:54,813 --> 00:35:56,041
Yeah...

364
00:36:47,093 --> 00:36:49,561
Put your hands where l can see them!

365
00:36:50,493 --> 00:36:53,291
Nina, put your hands on the steering wheel!

366
00:37:11,813 --> 00:37:13,565
Jack.

367
00:37:13,653 --> 00:37:16,884
lf you kill me, you won't know who l work for.

368
00:37:17,573 --> 00:37:20,565
You think l work for Drazen, but l don't.

369
00:37:22,613 --> 00:37:24,604
l trusted you.

370
00:37:26,333 --> 00:37:28,972
- l was just doing my job.
- Your job?

371
00:37:29,053 --> 00:37:32,204
My wife and daughter almost died today.

372
00:37:32,293 --> 00:37:36,923
How many people that trusted you lost their
life today because you were doing your job?

373
00:37:37,013 --> 00:37:39,811
Walsh. Jamey. Ellis.

374
00:37:39,893 --> 00:37:43,647
- How many others?
- How many died because of you, Jack?

375
00:37:43,733 --> 00:37:47,362
(Mason) Jack, take it easy. We need her alive.

376
00:37:47,453 --> 00:37:50,092
Come on, Jack. Kim just got here.

377
00:37:50,173 --> 00:37:53,324
They're taking her inside right now. Come on.

378
00:37:53,413 --> 00:37:56,086
(Tony) Jack, don't do it.

379
00:37:57,893 --> 00:38:03,047
Come on, Jack. Come and be
with your family. Come on. Let's go.

380
00:38:05,373 --> 00:38:08,809
Let's go inside.
This is no good. Come on, Jack.

381
00:38:21,253 --> 00:38:23,244
Good, Jack. Come on.

382
00:38:23,333 --> 00:38:26,052
Come on. lt's OK.

383
00:38:27,293 --> 00:38:29,284
You all right?

384
00:38:30,693 --> 00:38:32,843
You did the right thing.

385
00:38:33,413 --> 00:38:35,881
You wanna take her up?

386
00:38:36,613 --> 00:38:38,604
Come on.

387
00:38:42,973 --> 00:38:45,168
All right. Let's go.

388
00:39:04,853 --> 00:39:06,206

389
00:39:06,293 --> 00:39:09,126
- Thank God you're all right. Aah!
- Oh, l'm sorry.

390

392
00:39:13,853 --> 00:39:17,482
- l'm positive. Oh, l was so worried.
- Oh, sweetheart.

393
00:39:18,653 --> 00:39:23,010
lt's all over, baby.
No one's gonna hurt you now, l promise.

394
00:39:24,173 --> 00:39:27,051
- l love you so much.

395
00:39:30,373 --> 00:39:33,763
- Where's Mom?
- l... l thought she was here with you.

396
00:39:33,853 --> 00:39:36,890
l'll go find her.
Just stay here with the guards, OK?

397
00:39:36,973 --> 00:39:38,964
- OK.
- OK.
