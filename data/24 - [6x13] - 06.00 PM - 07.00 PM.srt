1
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:15,589
Bomb!

2
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,359
<i>(man) We're at emergency med bay
with the president.</i>

3
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,749
Vice President Daniels runs this country now.

4
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,593
He will implement your security plan.

5
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,832
Lowry, these men are responsible
for the attempted assassination.

6
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,957
I have the vice president for Mr Buchanan.

7
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,837
I see from the White House flashes

8
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,708
that President Palmer
granted Charles Logan some kind of furlough.

9
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,394
Logan claims he can help us find
Dmitri Gredenko.

10
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,199
- How?
- Through the Russian consul.

11
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,636
The bomb that exploded
was a Russian suitcase nuclear device,

12
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:51,429
supplied to the terrorists by Dmitri Gredenko.

13
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,636
Where is he?

14
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,073
I don't know.

15
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,798
<i>- (phone rings)
- Yes?</i>

16
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,395
The United States
has connected you with terrorists.

17
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,349
The reason we brought the Arabs into this
was to conceal our involvement.

18
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,874
Now we are exposed. Russia is exposed.

19
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,315
You spent
nearly two years in a Chinese prison

20
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,198
because you violated
the sovereignty of their consulate.

21
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,513
Now you plan to go back into the consulate
and take a chance on that happening again?

22
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,319
How do I find Gredenko?

23
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,232
Mohave Desert. Shadow Valley.

24
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,878
What is he doing?

25
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,713
Launching drones.

26
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,360
How soon will the drones be ready?

27
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:36,479
In two hours, all the bombs will be in the air.

28
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,676
Don't move in yet.
He's too close to Markov.

29
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,557
Now!

30
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,754
I've gotta set
the transcript codes for the debrief.

31
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,234
Thank you.

32
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,509
Who are you?

33
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,718
I'm just Chloe O'Brian.
I need to do something on this computer.

34
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,916
Do you know what's going on
with Jack Bauer?

35
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,355
He's still being held in the Russian consulate.

36
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,672
- I need to talk to Bill Buchanan right now.
- He'll be here after his meeting.

37
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,548
Does he know that I'm all alone here
in a holding cell?

38
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:03,519
This isn't really a cell
and you're hardly alone.

39
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,751
This is standard procedure
for someone under house arrest.

40
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,231
- Excuse me?
- Sorry. I'm feeling ambivalent. I'm gonna go.

41
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,877
All right.
I want to introduce everyone to Mike Doyle.

42
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,474
He's the new head of field ops
in from Fort Bragg.

43
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,711
I want all tactical and comm agents
to report to him directly.

44
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,633
Jack's being held captive
in the Russian consulate.

45
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,154
I haven't opened up that
to anyone on the outside.

46
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:36,677
Doyle will help you put a tactical profile
together for an assault on the consulate.

47
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:41,436
So, we're prepared to provoke an international
incidentjust to liberate one operative?

48
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,511
No. Liberating Jack is a secondary goal.

49
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:47,036
Our primary objective is to abduct
Anatoly Markov, the consul.

50
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,591
According to Jack, Markov knows how to find
Gredenko, who controls the suitcase nukes.

51
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,037
Excuse me. Is nobody worried this could
be considered an act of war against Russia?

52
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:59,351
Ultimately, it's the vice president's decision
if we go in or not.

53
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,318
If Jack is right
and Markov is working with Gredenko,

54
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,709
the Russians will have to back down.

55
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,189
- Sir, Logan is ready for you.
- Thank you.

56
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,671
I want a comprehensive siege profile
on my desk ASAP.

57
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,076
- Who has the control keys for the servers?
- I do.

58
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,948
Bracket scenarios into three. I want
projected outcomes based on personnel.

59
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,600
Doyle, normally we run general attack...

60
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,673
<i>I don't care what you normally do, Pressman.
And I wasn't speaking to you.</i>

61
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,399
- I was talking with her.
- Yeah, it's so weird.

62
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:35,237
I had this thought that you might come here
and not be ajerk like in Denver, but you are.

63
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,709
That's right. Just like Denver.

64
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,474
Let's get to work.

65
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,111
- I take it you know him?
- Yeah. I don't like him very much.

66
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,829
- Does he know what he's doing?
- Yeah, he's good.

67
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,799
What did Buchanan say?

68
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,553
We're ready to move
pending White House approval.

69
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,790
- Is Jack on his own?
- Yeah.

70
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,919
This is all about getting Markov,
not saving Jack.

71
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,196
<i>- (phone rings)
- Yeah?</i>

72
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:27,031
I'm terminating the American.
Do you confirm?

73
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,109
Yes.

74
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,556
And you're sure there won't be
any political complications?

75
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,835
Not if we stick to our story.

76
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:38,671
The American kills the head of security,
tries to escape.

77
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:02,835
The American has shot Vasili.
He's in the basement. Find him.

78
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,153
<i>(alarm)</i>

79
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,590
<i>- (man) Consul Markov.
- Yes?</i>

80
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,956
We haven't found the American,
but I locked down the perimeter.

81
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:56,192
- There is no way to leave.
- He can't be allowed to call out.

82
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:59,272
Shut down the phone lines,
DSL, everything!

83
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,351
<i>(guards shout)</i>

84
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,397
<i>(phone rings)</i>

85
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,630
- CTU, O'Brian.
- Morris, it's Jack.

86
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:21,278
<i>- I know how to find Gredenko. He's...
- (phone crackles)</i>

87
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,952
- Morris?
- Jack?

88
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,630
Jack? Jack?

89
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,711
Come on.

90
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,069
Dammit!

91
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,795
<i>(alarm continues)</i>

92
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,634
<i>(alarm stops)</i>

93
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,631
Sir, Morris just got a call from Jack.

94
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,996
The line went dead,
but he says he knows where Gredenko is.

95
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,674
- Did you trace the call?
- He's still inside.

96
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:02,515
Monitor everything. Tell Doyle Bauer has
got key intel and is no longer dispensable.

97
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,511
Got it.

98
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,830
<i>(door buzzes/opens)</i>

99
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,028
I'm sorry,
we have to reschedule our debrief.

100
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,237
- Why?
- We have a situation at the consulate.

101
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:24,348
Does this have something to do with Bauer
going back in there to question Markov?

102
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:27,637
Please, Bill. Maybe I can help.

103
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,473
Jack was able
to get Gredenko's location from Markov.

104
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,030
He tried to call us,
but was cut off before he could say more.

105
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,669
He's either being held prisoner in
the consulate or he's being pursued.

106
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:48,390
Then I was right, Markov is involved. And he
will do whatever it takes to keep Jack quiet.

107
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,630
We have to extricate Jack.

108
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,793
Failing that, we have to go in and remove
Markov and interrogate him ourselves.

109
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,030
We don't have time to go through red tape.

110
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,554
There's no red tape. I'm launching an assault.

111
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,234
No, that's... that is a huge mistake.

112
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,915
Markov will not let himself be taken alive,
and he will kill Jack Bauer.

113
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,991
We have to try something.

114
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,072
Have you tried any pressure
from President Suvarov?

115
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,675
Vice President Daniels has spoken
to Suvarov. He's reluctant to act.

116
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:18,548
- It's a diplomatic standoff.
- He needs to be convinced to get involved.

117
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,835
I don't know how to do that.

118
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,834
- I do.
- How?

119
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:33,155
My ex-wife, Martha. She became friends
with the Suvarovs, especially the wife.

120
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,596
Anya can get through to Yuri.
He listens to her.

121
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,592
They're a very good team.

122
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:43,876
With all due respect,
hasn't Mrs Logan been institutionalised?

123
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:48,078
That's beside the point.
She's in a unique position to help us.

124
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,555
All right. I'll put a call in to her.

125
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,914
Bill... let me do it.

126
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:01,389
Martha can be very difficult.
I think it would be best if I talked to her.

127
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:05,075
- I didn't realise you were on speaking terms.
- We're not.

128
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:08,072
But I think I can get through to her.
I know I can.

129
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,869
Please, let me try.

130
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,755
- That's the way I want it.
- Yes, sir.

131
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,070
- How many on each of those teams?
- Five.

132
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,879
- Make it three. More teams, more coverage.
- Fine.

133
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:23,919
- Who's estimating defence figures?
- That would be... me.

134
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,074
- Where are the numbers?
- I'm just sorting them.

135
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:31,551
- Of course you are. Where are the numbers?
- This is about how many seconds it takes.

136
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,359
There are your numbers sorted three ways.
Pick one.

137
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,675
Hey!

138
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:42,674
Do I have your attention?
Cos I only wanna do this once.

139
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,269
I have 25 soldiers
that are about to put their asses on the line.

140
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:51,955
Whether they live or die
largely depends on what gets done here.

141
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:56,352
That's not to mention three nuclear weapons
that may be down the street for all we know.

142
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:01,912
So if anyone has a problem taking orders
from me without giving me lip, tell me now,

143
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,468
and I will have you reassigned.

144
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:18,315
Doyle. You keep your hands off my people.
Is that clear?

145
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:23,076
- They need to know what I expect from them.
- I know what you expect. That's enough.

146
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:26,357
You have a problem with somebody
on my team, you come to me.

147
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:32,231
Fair enough. Have your team merge their
results and download them onto my system.

148
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,471
You all right?

149
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:43,634
- The shirt's a blend. It doesn't wrinkle.
- You know what I mean.

150
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,871
Yes. I am all right.

151
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,639
<i>You thought I was a pain in the ass.</i>

152
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:56,436
The vice president likes you.
He hopes you have the right answer.

153
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,431
Well, I hope so, too.

154
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,190
Tom Lennox. Man of the hour.

155
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:08,478
- It's all right. You can leave us alone.
- Yes, sir.

156
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,759
So, have you given any thought
to our earlier conversation?

157
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,558
- Yes, I have, sir.
- And?

158
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:21,077
And I agree that the priority here
is to protect our country,

159
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:24,596
and I am prepared to look the other way

160
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:28,309
regarding details of...

161
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,868
the assassination plot.

162
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:34,839
- To a point.
- Well, what does that mean?

163
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,309
It means the truth must ultimately come out.

164
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:41,313
Reed and Carson need to be punished
for what they did.

165
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:47,350
And they will. Look, all I'm trying to do
is keep America united.

166
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,194
I can't have our critics screaming,
"Look at how bad we are".

167
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:54,033
"We're worse than the terrorists".

168
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:59,069
- We need to keep our eye on the ball now.
- On that point, sir, we are in agreement.

169
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:02,311
Good, cos I need you to tell
the ambassador of Assad's country

170
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:06,188
that you saw Assad
plant the bomb that injured the president.

171
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,550
Sir, looking the other way is one thing.

172
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:16,555
Choosing to tell a lie to the ambassador,
that becomes a matter of record.

173
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,033
Now, you listen to me.

174
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,159
If we expect to navigate through this crisis,
I need you to cooperate.

175
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:33,119
- I would like to cooperate...
- I'm still talking!

176
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:41,268
Come on now, Tom. Let's just
count our blessings here for a minute.

177
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,510
President Palmer survived this attack.

178
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,639
Neither you nor I had anything to do with
this heinous plot to kill him.

179
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,188
And the most beautiful fact of all

180
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:53,750
is that we now have the opportunity
to implement the correct policy

181
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:56,912
to stop these terrorist lunatics.

182
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:06,838
Can you just put aside
your distaste for my methods for one minute?

183
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:11,311
Think about the great gift
that's been given to us.

184
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:14,597
- I will think long and hard, sir.
- Good.

185
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,989
Now...

186
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:22,438
I need you to tell the ambassador
that Assad carried in the bomb.

187
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,231
I'll take it from there.

188
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,191
OK?

189
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:37,037
OK. Lisa, get the ambassador clearance
and bring him down here.

190
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,950
Let DOJ know that Lennox
has been cleared of any wrongdoing

191
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:45,112
and will continue serving as Chief of Staff.

192
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,191
Yes, sir.

193
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:53,793
Sir, I would like to know what you hope
to achieve in your talk with the ambassador.

194
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:59,716
I want him to know that I hold his country
responsible for all of it -

195
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:03,076
the nuke and
the presidential assassination attempt.

196
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:06,118
They need to be motivated
to rein in these terrorists,

197
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,873
and I want them to know
that America is mad as hell

198
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:13,238
and ready to retaliate
with a nuclear option if they don't.

199
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,991
Here's Fayed.

200
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,634
It's about time he got here.
We need to start loading the bombs.

201
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,958
Mr Vice President.

202
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,316
Bill, I'm here with Tom Lennox.
What's going on at the consulate?

203
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,789
<i>Jack Bauer's still at large somewhere inside.</i>

204
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,270
It appears he knows Gredenko's location,
but can't get it to us.

205
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,316
All right. What's the plan?

206
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:20,111
Former President Logan believes he can
convince his ex-wife to call Anya Suvarov.

207
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:24,273
He thinks the Russian First Lady
can get through to her husband.

208
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:28,148
That's as likely as the terrorists
knocking on my door and surrendering.

209
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,755
I agree. That's why
we've also prepared a siege plan.

210
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:36,118
A strike force will enter the consulate
and extract Markov for interrogation.

211
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:40,557
You realise an attack on a Russian consulate
is technically an act of war?

212
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:44,394
- I do, sir.
- I'm reluctant to go the tactical route here.

213
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,870
We've got our hands full.
We don't need to open up another front.

214
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:51,316
It's your decision, sir.
I understand the politics are sticky,

215
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:54,073
but my responsibility is to stop these nukes.

216
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,755
<i>Markov will not surrender willingly.
We have to go in.</i>

217
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:00,752
How long will it take you
to put together this siege?

218
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,992
- 20 minutes.
- About 20 minutes.

219
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:12,037
All right, proceed as if you're going in.
If Logan can be effective before then, great.

220
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,270
<i>- But don't wait on him.
- Yes, sir.</i>

221
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,273
- You ready?
- Yes.

222
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:19,989
- Take your team and await our word.
- Got it.

223
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,554
Agent.

224
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:35,114
Martha? Just me.

225
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,749
Did you get some rest?

226
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,308
- I've been worried about you.
- Worried about me?

227
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,597
You shouldn't be driving around
with that fallout in the air.

228
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:50,036
I'm keeping a good distance away.
How are you?

229
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:54,469
I've decided to read my book
and listen to music.

230
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:00,038
I've lived with enough fear over the years.
I don't need any more.

231
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,631
Good for you.

232
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:07,271
- Got your magazines.
- Thank you.

233
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:11,078
And... I stopped by Mel's.

234
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:17,353
- Did you get raspberries?
- And blackberries and fresh kiwi fruit.

235
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,000
Oh, thank God for Mel.

236
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,072
What would I do without that man's produce?

237
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,994
Oh, these look beautiful.

238
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,638
Mm!

239
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,836
- Oh, here. Have one.
- I'm fine.

240
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,239
Go on.

241
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,639
<i>(Martha giggles)</i>

242
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,996
<i>(phone rings)</i>

243
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,071
Could you get that?

244
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,678
Martha Logan's bungalow.

245
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:54,315
<i>- May I speak to Martha, please?
- Who is this?</i>

246
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,593
It's Charles, Aaron.
Put her on. It's important.

247
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,399
Hold on.

248
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,755
- Who is it?
- It's Charles.

249
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,591
He says it's important.

250
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:13,556
Important to whom?

251
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:17,235
<i>- Mr Logan, she doesn't wanna talk to you.
- I heard what she said.</i>

252
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:20,596
Listen, I am at CTU in Los Angeles
on government business

253
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:23,069
and it has to do with the nuclear attack.

254
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:26,197
I don't understand
how Martha could possibly be of any help.

255
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:31,752
- What you understand really doesn't matter.
- I no longer have to tolerate your sarcasm.

256
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:37,631
This was not sarcasm. Something needs to be
done and I think Martha might be able to help.

257
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:41,793
I don't know what to tell you, but
Martha simply doesn't wanna speak with you.

258
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:45,873
She hasn't taken your calls in almost
two years. I don't know why she would now.

259
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,076
<i>- Tell her it's about the Suvarovs.
- What?</i>

260
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,038
Just do it. Please.

261
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,028
- Martha, he wants to ask you something...
- I told you, I don't wanna talk to him.

262
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,588
It's about the Suvarovs.

263
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:08,556
- What's wrong? Has something happened?
- I don't know.

264
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,031
What is it? Is Anya OK?

265
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:18,631
- Anya's fine, Martha. They're both fine.
- Then what the hell do you want?

266
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:25,272
It's a very delicate matter.
There's an international incident brewing

267
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,557
and I think that you
might be able to help diffuse it.

268
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,471
Let me get this straight.

269
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:37,398
The government is desperate so they come
to you to fix the world, and you come to me.

270
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:41,591
I can't be dragged into
another drama with you. I won't.

271
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:45,275
You know what's going on today.
You know that this is important.

272
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,990
This is absurd.

273
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,996
- You still there?
- Yes, I'm still here.

274
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,389
I wouldn't play games on a day like today.

275
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,468
I know.

276
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:10,388
You need to convince her to see me. I'll take
a chopper and I'll be there in a few minutes.

277
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,796
Aaron?

278
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:18,995
All right.

279
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,599
This is Shavers.

280
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,671
<i>(Buchanan) Stan, let me talk to Logan.</i>

281
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,751
Sir, it's Mr Buchanan.

282
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,549
Yes, Bill?

283
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,349
<i>We've dispatched personnel
for an assault on the Russian consulate.</i>

284
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:57,910
Bill, attacking the consulate
is a huge error in judgment.

285
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,638
This has been decided.

286
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:02,871
The only way to avoid
full confrontation with the Russians

287
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:07,750
is for you to get Martha
to make that call before we engage.

288
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,191
<i>(woman mutters)</i>

289
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,079
<i>(woman giggles)</i>

290
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:40,478
- Slowly, both of you against the wall.
- Please, don't hurt her.

291
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:44,758
I have no attention of hurting you,
but if you don't cooperate, I will kill you.

292
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:47,229
You understand me?
Both of you speak English?

293
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,959
- Yes.
- I need to make an outside call.

294
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:53,669
You can't. They've cut all communications
because you killed Stovich.

295
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,672
- I didn't kill Stovich.
- I don't believe you.

296
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,718
- I don't have to convince you.
- Whatever you want.

297
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:03,349
In case of an emergency,
how do you contact the outside world?

298
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,715
Please, there's a satcom phone upstairs.

299
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:08,633
- Get it and bring it down here.
- We're in a lockdown.

00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,029
That's your problem. Get me that phone.

301
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,111
- Now!
- OK.

302
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,354
Get against the desk.

303
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,431
Don't be scared.

304
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,471
You'll be fine.

305
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,311
Hello, Aaron.

306
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,796
Martha's waiting for you. She's inside.

307
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,871
Thank you.

308
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,236
Martha.

309
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,674
I'll get her.

310
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,198
<i>- (Aaron) Charles is here.
- (Martha) Send him away.</i>

311
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:39,239
- But, Martha, he flew here.
- I know, but I've changed my mind.

312
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,515
I don't want to see him.

313
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:53,273
- What's the matter?
- She's changed her mind.

314
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,351
Sorry, but she doesn't wanna see you.

315
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:00,912
Aaron... you have to convince her this is not
about us, this is for the good of the country.

316
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,629
- I told her that.
- If we don't do something quickly,

317
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,030
there's gonna be a US-led assault
on the Russian consulate here.

318
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:12,272
So on top of everything else,
we will effectively be at war with Russia.

319
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,828
<i>(Martha) You've lost weight.</i>

320
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,350
Martha.

321
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:28,837
So this is the new improved Charles Logan.

322
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,511
Reborn.

323
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,870
You look beautiful.

324
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,109
What do you want?

325
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:51,272
- I need you to call Anya Suvarov.
- What do you want me to say?

326
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:58,072
She has to convince Yuri to order the Russian
consul here in Los Angeles to surrender.

327
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,355
And why would he do that?

328
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:05,958
Because the man, Anatoly Markov, he's
a criminal working outside Russian authority.

329
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,315
- So what?
- He's also a mass murderer.

330
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:13,758
The bomb that went off this morning was
supplied to the terrorists with Markov's help.

331
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,276
There are other bombs out there.
He knows where they are.

332
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,878
Why doesn't the White House
contact Yuri directly?

333
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:24,076
- They did. It didn't work.
- Why not?

334
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:28,199
This is very complicated. Please
don't make me explain everything in detail...

335
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:32,319
Oh, oh, I'm sorry!
Just do as you say without asking.

336
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,675
I'm sorry! You haven't changed a bit.

337
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,830
Look. Look at this.

338
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:41,072
I'm still under arrest.
After this is over, I go back to prison.

339
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,469
I'm just trying to help.

340
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,232
"Prison"?

341
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:50,952
Oh, is that what you call a 10,000 square-foot
house with a pool and a tennis court?

342
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:54,874
Yuri has to be convinced that this man,
Markov, is a traitor to his country.

343
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:59,829
Anya can make our case for us. You're
the only person who can reach her fast.

344
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:09,149
Do you think I should do this?

345
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,508
Yes, I do.

346
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,995
I need a drink.

347
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:36,831
Not that knocking me off the wagon wouldn't
be a small price to pay for saving the world.

348
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,394
Get Anya on the phone.

349
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,471
I'll talk to her.

350
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:07,751
<i>- (Nadia) How far are you from the consulate?
- A few minutes. Any change of plans?</i>

351
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:11,799
No. As far as I know, the assault is still a go.
I'm about to talk to Buchanan now.

352
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:15,156
<i>- Call me if anything changes.
- OK.</i>

353
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:21,039
- Have a seat, Mr Ambassador.
- Thank you.

354
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,510
How is President Palmer?

355
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,117
Well, the president's a tough man.

356
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:33,351
He's injured, but we're confident
he'll make a full recovery.

357
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,318
- What a tragic and despicable act.
- I agree.

358
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:39,915
What is more troubling is
a citizen of your country, Hamri Al-Assad,

359
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,275
was responsible for the attack.

360
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:45,238
I understand that Assad
lost his life in the blast.

361
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:49,871
I was led to believe that he was working with
President Palmer to promote a peace plan.

362
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:53,316
Well, I'm afraid that was all a ruse,
Mr Ambassador.

363
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:58,110
Assad's real intentions became clear
when he detonated the explosive.

364
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,475
- You have proof of this?
- Conclusive.

365
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:03,711
Forensic evidence,
as well as at least one eyewitness

366
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:09,670
who saw the detonator in Assad's hand
immediately before the explosion.

367
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,751
Isn't that right, Tom?

368
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,628
Yes, sir. That is correct.

369
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,238
Even if what you say is true,

370
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:23,871
you must know that Hamri Al-Assad was not
working at the behest of our government.

371
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:28,670
He was as much a wanted man in our country
as he was in yours.

372
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:31,479
Oh, not as much.

373
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:35,439
- But that's gonna change.
- What are you referring to?

374
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,511
The terrorists presently on US soil

375
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:42,469
are acting under the orders of citizens in your
country who have the support of government.

376
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,869
- I know it and you know it.
- That is not true.

377
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:48,430
I say it is, and I'm willing
to bet you that I'm right.

378
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,750
What do you mean?

379
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:55,516
I have a carrier group within striking distance
of every major city in your country

380
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,431
waiting for my order.

381
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:00,637
- You would attack us?
- Abu Fayed, a citizen of your country,

382
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:05,430
enters the United States and detonates
a nuclear bomb killing thousands.

383
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:09,274
Next, Assad attempts
to assassinate the president.

384
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:15,071
We cannot be held responsible. We have
cooperated since the inception of this crisis.

385
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:19,392
These threats are reckless.
I had an understanding with your president.

386
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,869
And now you're gonna have one with me.

387
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,875
You help us find those nukes
before another goes off

388
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:31,511
or I'm gonna unleash the full power
of our military on your country.

389
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,076
<i>- Keep me posted.
- (man) Yes, sir.</i>

390
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:39,948
Doyle is approaching. We can be
in the consulate in less than 15 minutes.

391
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:42,508
- It's gonna come right down to the wire.
- What?

392
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:47,594
Charles Logan and I are trying to arrange
a call between his ex-wife and Anya Suvarov.

393
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:50,478
- When?
- Mrs Suvarov's giving a speech in Omsk.

394
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,551
We have to wait till she's finished.

395
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:57,350
Even if Mrs Logan gets through to Anya,
it'll take time to change her husband's mind.

396
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,034
I agree. It's a long shot.

397
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:04,272
- It shouldn't take much longer.
- It's important. Why not interrupt the speech?

398
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:07,511
It's Russian politics.
There's nothing we can do.

399
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,477
Fine.

400
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:14,357
It's gonna be a few more minutes.

401
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,639
- What's the matter, honey?
- It's taking forever.

402
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:22,359
I know.

403
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:27,036
Aaron, do you promise you'll stand by me
if I can't go through with this?

404
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,270
Course I will.

405
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:34,150
Martha, I'm sorry.
The last thing I wanted to do was upset you.

406
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:39,593
Funny, you always managed
to get to that last thing.

407
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,192
May I ask you something, Charles?

408
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,748
Does it bother you
to see me with another man?

409
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:52,913
- Martha, please.
- We may as well talk to fill the time.

410
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,356
We never really had any closure.

411
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,235
Well?

412
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:04,876
Yes, it's very difficult,
if you wanna know the truth.

413
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,520
But you've had a rebirth.

414
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:13,152
- You should be happy for my happiness.
- I am happy for you, Martha.

415
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,794
I'm sure you are.

416
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:26,712
You know, Charles,
Aaron has taken such good care of me.

417
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:31,430
I don't know what I did
to deserve such a good man.

418
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:36,196
I never knew what that was before -
a really good man.

419
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:40,910
If it makes you feel better to insult me,
feel free. I didn't come here to fight with you.

420
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,675
It does make me feel better.
I can say exactly what I want, finally,

421
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:47,149
without having to worry about your wrath.

422
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:52,598
The great Charles Logan. The president of
the universe, the great leader, the murderer!

423
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:56,992
Martha, I want you to stop this right now.
You're gonna get all stirred up.

424
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:01,596
Oh, well, God,
we couldn't have that, could we?!

425
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:10,231
Mr Logan, if you'd be more comfortable
waiting outside, I'd understand.

426
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:14,393
I appreciate that, Aaron,
but I think I'll stay right here.

427
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:25,757
Actually, I'm very thankful
you've been able to be here for Martha.

428
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:29,310
You are a good man.
She's very lucky to have you.

429
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:37,154
- Now you're trying to irritate me, aren't you?
- No, Martha, no. I'm not.

430
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:43,516
Oh, cut the crap.
All the sincerity, the new enlightened soul.

431
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:48,151
- At least you used to be an honest crook.
- That's enough, please.

432
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,431
Sorry. I'll be a good little girl.

433
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,315
<i>- Oh, my God.
- (Martha) Sorry. I'm sorry.</i>

434
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,789
I did it. I did it.

435
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:15,236
- He... he wouldn't stop. He...
- We need a medic in here right now!

436
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:18,198
He just wouldn't stop. And I... Oh!

437
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:21,158
It must have hit an artery.
We need a medic in here now!

438
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:23,993
- Agent Foley, get in here now!
- Somebody, come on!

439
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,638
<i>(Martha) Oh, no!</i>

440
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,875
<i>(Aaron) Stay with us!</i>

441
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:47,229
<i>(man) He's going into shock.
Let's get him out of here. Now.</i>

442
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:56,393
<i>- It happened too fast, Bill. I couldn't stop her.
- There's nothing we can do.</i>

443
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:00,439
I've been ordered to send an assault team
into the Russian consulate

444
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:03,592
- unless President Suvarov intercedes.
- I understand.

445
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:08,310
Is Martha capable of having a coherent
conversation with Anya Suvarov?

446
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,632
- Honestly, I don't know.
- Chloe's putting the call through. Find out.

447
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:13,789
Will do.

448
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:24,116
Why are they doing this to me?
I should be given a medal.

449
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:28,796
He was one of the biggest criminals
in history. They gave him house arrest.

450
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:32,509
Martha, we're still in a crisis situation.

451
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:35,876
Are you able to handle the conversation
with Anya Suvarov?

452
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:40,476
Of course I am. I'm not crazy.
I know what the stakes are.

453
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:43,793
Are you sure?

454
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:49,477
Mr Pierce, CTU has got Anya Suvarov
on the line for Mrs Logan.

455
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:52,233
They're putting it through now.

456
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:56,353
Do you know what you're gonna say?

457
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:03,077
Anya, it's Martha. How are you?

458
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:07,278
I'm fine. I've been worried about you
there in California.

459
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:10,272
Stop worrying, everything's gonna be fine.

460
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:14,512
I know we have a lot to catch up on, but I'm
gonna have to be rude and get to the point.

461
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:17,558
- There's not a lot of time.
- What is it?

462
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:21,155
If you've talked to Yuri,
you know there's a very tense situation

463
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,549
at the Russian consulate in Los Angeles.

464
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:26,154
I've heard about it,
but don't know the details.

465
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:31,155
- The details are very important, Anya.
- Please, tell me more.

466
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,072
The American stepped on Russian soil.

467
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:10,233
<i>- He took me hostage.
- We will sort out the details later.</i>

468
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,630
Right now, I am ordering you
to surrender to the Americans

469
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:16,632
and deliver Jack Bauer unharmed.

470
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:21,315
I am afraid...

471
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:24,517
I cannot do that, Mr President.

472
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:29,799
How dare you disobey a direct order?
You will do exactly as I tell you!

473
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:47,789
Mr Buchanan,
Consul Markov is not cooperating.

474
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:50,952
You understand this leaves me
with very few options?

475
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,474
I do.

476
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:57,678
I will personally authorise
the use of force against the consulate.

477
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:02,072
The United States of America has the support
of the Russian state in this matter.

478
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,593
Thank you, Mr President.

479
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,076
- I got it.
- Get over here.

480
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:22,556
- Is anybody gonna notice it's missing?
- In a few minutes, yes. Make your call.

481
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,995
- Did he hurt you?
- No.

482
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:29,149
It needs the unlock code.

483
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:49,756
<i>- (Buchanan) Suvarov gave us the go-ahead.
- Go!</i>

484
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,558
- Are you hit?
- No.

485
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,077
<i>(phone rings)</i>

486
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:45,879
- Yes?
- It's Markov. The Americans are coming in.

487
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:50,511
- I thought you had that under control.
- No. Soon they will have your position.

488
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:55,230
- Hold them off as long as you can.
- I will, but you must launch now!

489
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,312
Drop your weapon! Do it now!

490
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:03,389
<i>- (man) Search the area.
- My name is Jack Bauer.</i>

491
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:07,917
- This man needs medical attention.
- Send medics to the basement. Mike Doyle.

492
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,913
Contact Bill Buchanan. Tell him Fayed
and Gredenko are in the Shadow Valley.

493
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,389
Patch me in with Buchanan.

494
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:23,395
This drone is ready to launch. Arm the bomb.

495
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:34,749
Got it. Put all the satellite coverage we have
on Shadow Valley.

496
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:53,118
Sir, stay still.
We'll have you at the hospital in a minute.

497
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:56,192
- Martha...
- Sir, please don't try to talk.

498
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:01,276
<i>(rapid beeping)</i>

499
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:03,191
He's starting to crash.

500
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,951
We're losing him!

501
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,037
