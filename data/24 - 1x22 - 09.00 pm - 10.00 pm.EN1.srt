00:00:12,773 --> 00:00:18,086
(Jack) Right now, terrorists are plotting
to assassinate a presidential candidate.

2
00:00:18,173 --> 00:00:20,562
My wife and daughter have been targeted.

3
00:00:20,653 --> 00:00:24,771
And people that l work with
may be involved in both.

4
00:00:24,853 --> 00:00:30,325
l'm Federal Agent Jack Bauer,
and today is the longest day of my life.

5
00:00:34,093 --> 00:00:36,129
This is our night.

6
00:00:36,213 --> 00:00:40,889
Once you're in the White House,
everything defers to the office.

7
00:00:40,973 --> 00:00:44,010
lt's what you need to do the job.

8
00:00:44,093 --> 00:00:47,802
lf it's your marriage
that helps you, that's great.

9
00:00:47,893 --> 00:00:53,604
But if not, that's OK too.
You can have whatever you want, David.

10
00:00:54,853 --> 00:00:57,162
We gotta get outta here. Which way?

11
00:00:57,253 --> 00:01:01,929
l'm in an underground detention facility.
lt's being used as a prison to house Drazen.

12
00:01:02,013 --> 00:01:04,766
You said you took him out two years ago.

13
00:01:06,133 --> 00:01:08,931
- Take cover!
- Let my father go, Bauer.

14
00:01:09,493 --> 00:01:10,972
The weapon's up.

15
00:01:11,053 --> 00:01:15,285
When does your suffering end? After
you've killed all your thousands of enemies?

16
00:01:15,373 --> 00:01:17,364
Yes.

17
00:01:18,373 --> 00:01:21,171
l will offer you one consolation.

18
00:01:21,253 --> 00:01:23,972
Your family will be joining you soon.

19
00:01:24,053 --> 00:01:26,408
Your son Alexis -
do you wanna see him again?

20
00:01:26,493 --> 00:01:29,053
We captured him and l know where he is.

21
00:01:30,013 --> 00:01:31,685
Get him in.

22
00:01:34,253 --> 00:01:35,288
l'm releasing you.

23
00:01:35,373 --> 00:01:38,809
- (Kim) Did my dad call?
- No, but l talked to the people he works with.

24
00:01:38,893 --> 00:01:42,124
- Have you spoken to my mom?
- Yeah. She's waiting for you at CTU.

25
00:01:42,213 --> 00:01:43,851
- Are you serious?
- l'm serious.

26
00:01:43,933 --> 00:01:47,972
- (Teri) How didyou end up injail?
- l'll tell you everything when l get there.

27
00:01:48,053 --> 00:01:50,362
(Kim screams)

28
00:01:51,373 --> 00:01:53,409
No! No! No!

29
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:56,324
Help me! No!

30
00:02:03,973 --> 00:02:07,363
No! No! No! No!

31
00:02:07,973 --> 00:02:09,452
No! No!

32
00:02:09,533 --> 00:02:11,524
No! No!

33
00:02:27,133 --> 00:02:29,442
(men speak in Serbian)

34
00:02:48,733 --> 00:02:51,327
(man speaks in Serbian)

35
00:03:17,813 --> 00:03:21,931
(over PA) And now l'm proud to present
the future president ofthe United States:

36
00:03:22,013 --> 00:03:24,004
Senator David Palmer.

37
00:03:32,653 --> 00:03:34,644
Congratulations, Senator.

38
00:03:35,133 --> 00:03:37,124
Hey, we did it.

39
00:03:45,573 --> 00:03:47,848
You know, this is our victory,

40
00:03:47,933 --> 00:03:52,131
and when we started out
they said the country wasn't ready.

41
00:03:52,213 --> 00:03:55,091
They said it couldn't be done,
that it would never happen.

42
00:03:55,173 --> 00:03:58,722
Well, here we are, still standing tall.

43
00:04:01,893 --> 00:04:07,126
And when we look back at this amazing time
we can all say that we were a part of history.

44
00:04:07,933 --> 00:04:11,642
We can all say that we did our part
to make this world a better place,

45
00:04:11,733 --> 00:04:16,204
and, God willing, our children and our
children's children will reap the benefits

46
00:04:16,293 --> 00:04:18,887
of the seeds we sow right now.

47
00:04:34,253 --> 00:04:36,244
(phone rings)

48
00:04:39,133 --> 00:04:41,124
- CTU. Myers.
- (Jack) Nina, it's me.

49
00:04:41,213 --> 00:04:44,922
- Jack, where are you?
- l'm with Andre and Victor Drazen.

50
00:04:45,013 --> 00:04:49,006
- What do you mean? Where?
- Nina, just listen. l'm being held hostage.

51
00:04:49,093 --> 00:04:54,008
The reason why l'm calling is Victor wants
confirmation that his son Alexis is still alive.

52
00:04:54,093 --> 00:04:57,210
He's in the hospital.
l can try to get through to his room.

53
00:04:57,293 --> 00:04:59,887
- OK, do it.
- OK. Hold on.

54
00:04:59,973 --> 00:05:03,602
Tony, get me the hospital.
l need Alexis Drazen on line two.

55
00:05:07,893 --> 00:05:11,442
l spoke to the backup team.
Drazen escaped. l want a net over the area.

56
00:05:11,533 --> 00:05:14,001
l want one, three and
five-mile mobile barriers.

57
00:05:14,093 --> 00:05:17,005
We know. We've got Jack on the line.
He's with Victor Drazen.

58
00:05:17,093 --> 00:05:19,482
- What?
- (Tony) Nina, l've got Alexis Drazen.

59
00:05:19,573 --> 00:05:21,325
Transfer it.

60
00:05:23,053 --> 00:05:25,647
- Who... who is this?
- Hold on.

61
00:05:27,933 --> 00:05:30,049
Alexie?

62
00:05:30,133 --> 00:05:31,930
Father.

63
00:05:32,013 --> 00:05:34,766
Where... where are you? Did you get out?

64
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:38,643
Alexie, what happened?
What have they done to you?

65
00:05:39,773 --> 00:05:42,765
You.. you always said that...

66
00:05:43,693 --> 00:05:46,082
l would get in trouble with women.

67
00:05:49,133 --> 00:05:51,010
You were right.

68
00:05:51,093 --> 00:05:54,403
Forgive me, Father. l failedyou.

69
00:05:54,493 --> 00:05:57,246
You have not failed. You are alive. l am free.

70
00:05:58,693 --> 00:06:00,923
Free.

71
00:06:01,013 --> 00:06:03,004
Hold on, Alexie.

72
00:06:04,213 --> 00:06:06,443
We will be together soon.

73
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,171
No, Papa.

74
00:06:08,253 --> 00:06:12,132
You go without me. l'm not going to make it.

75
00:06:12,213 --> 00:06:15,967
You will make it. Be strong.
Tell me you can do this.

76
00:06:16,053 --> 00:06:18,328
Yeah, Papa.

77
00:06:18,413 --> 00:06:20,927
l have something to say to the rest of you.

78
00:06:22,253 --> 00:06:27,043
l am willing to trade the life
of Jack Bauer for that of my son.

79
00:06:28,453 --> 00:06:30,569
Mr Drazen, this is George Mason again.

80
00:06:30,653 --> 00:06:34,009
l'm acting head of the CTU. l don't
have the authority to make the trade.

81
00:06:34,093 --> 00:06:36,926
lf you do not have the authority,
you are not head of anything.

82
00:06:37,013 --> 00:06:41,211
Talk to your superiors.
We will call back in 15 minutes.

83
00:06:41,293 --> 00:06:44,046
Be ready to respond without qualification.

84
00:06:49,533 --> 00:06:53,731
And let me remind you that when
l was ten points behind in the polls,

85
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:58,568
l told you l had a plan that
on this date we were gonna celebrate,

86
00:06:58,653 --> 00:07:00,723
party nomination in hand.

87
00:07:00,813 --> 00:07:02,929
Well, promise delivered.

88
00:07:10,653 --> 00:07:13,087
- Hi.
- Hi.

89
00:07:13,173 --> 00:07:17,132
l'm not gonna be able to go
to Dallas with David tomorrow.

90
00:07:18,173 --> 00:07:19,242
Why not?

91
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:23,645
l committed to a National Youth
Service Day event here in LA.

92
00:07:23,733 --> 00:07:29,285
- That's OK. l can reschedule that.
- No, Patty, l don't want you to reschedule.

93
00:07:29,373 --> 00:07:35,209
David and l could use a couple of days apart.
But l don't want him to feel alone, OK?

94
00:07:36,213 --> 00:07:38,204
Whatever you want.

95
00:07:38,293 --> 00:07:41,285
..doing the right thing is the only thing to do.

96
00:07:48,773 --> 00:07:53,449
Thank you, everybody. Have a good time,
cos tomorrow we start all over again.

97
00:07:53,533 --> 00:07:55,922
All the way to the White House.

98
00:08:06,053 --> 00:08:08,647
- You talk to Chapelle?
- Yeah.

99
00:08:09,293 --> 00:08:11,124
- No trade.
- What?

100
00:08:11,213 --> 00:08:14,410
This whole Victor Drazen thing
is a big embarrassment for them.

101
00:08:14,493 --> 00:08:17,405
lf they do a trade,
it's an admission that he's alive,

102
00:08:17,493 --> 00:08:22,283
that the DOD's kept him here secretly,
and that on top of that they let him escape.

103
00:08:22,373 --> 00:08:25,365
So they're just gonna sacrifice Jack?

104
00:08:27,293 --> 00:08:30,205
He's like all the rest of us. Expendable.

105
00:08:30,893 --> 00:08:33,088
ls that what you think?

106
00:08:33,173 --> 00:08:36,961
lt doesn't matter what l think. l don't think
he walks on water the way you do,

107
00:08:37,053 --> 00:08:39,965
but l don't wanna see him
hung out to dry either.

108
00:08:40,053 --> 00:08:42,283
Nina, l tried.

109
00:08:42,373 --> 00:08:45,490
George, without the trade,
how are they gonna locate Drazen?

110
00:08:45,573 --> 00:08:50,169
l guess they won't try. They'll let him leave
the country and pick him up in Europe later.

111
00:08:50,253 --> 00:08:52,244
lf we do the trade, we know where he is.

112
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:56,042
Hey, you're preaching to the choir.
That's what l just said to Chapelle.

113
00:08:56,133 --> 00:08:59,330
They don't wanna draw
attention to the situation.

114
00:09:00,853 --> 00:09:03,242
End of story.

115
00:09:03,813 --> 00:09:08,045
So that's it. We just go back
to work and let Jack die.

116
00:09:10,773 --> 00:09:12,889
What can l say?

117
00:09:17,293 --> 00:09:19,284
Nothing.

118
00:09:38,653 --> 00:09:41,486
Nina. Shouldn't Kim be here by now?

119
00:09:41,573 --> 00:09:45,361
Well, they just left the police station.
She should be here soon.

120
00:09:45,453 --> 00:09:50,243
- l never did hear what happened with her.
- She was arrested by mistake. Listen, Teri.

121
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:55,851
- Kim's fine. That's not the problem.
- What do you mean? What's going on?

122
00:09:55,933 --> 00:10:00,085
lt's confirmed. Jack's been captured.
He's being held hostage.

123
00:10:01,013 --> 00:10:03,527
We're doing all we can
to bring him back, but...

124
00:10:03,613 --> 00:10:05,604
Wait.

125
00:10:08,573 --> 00:10:10,962
- What do they want?
- lt's hard to say.

126
00:10:11,053 --> 00:10:13,851
Well, tell me what you know.

127
00:10:14,693 --> 00:10:19,244
This guy Drazen wants to trade Jack
for his son Alexis, who we have.

128
00:10:19,933 --> 00:10:21,969
Well, then, he'll be OK, right?

129
00:10:22,053 --> 00:10:24,772
No. The government won't make the trade.

130
00:10:26,413 --> 00:10:31,123
What do you mean, they won't make the
trade? How are they gonna get Jack back?

131
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:33,932
They're not. Jack's on his own.

132
00:10:37,173 --> 00:10:39,164
l'm sorry.

133
00:10:58,493 --> 00:11:01,724
There can be no flaws
and it must be done soon.

134
00:11:01,813 --> 00:11:06,967
l don't care how much it costs or how many
men you need. We're out of here by midnight.

135
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:10,682
Call me back. Let me know.

136
00:11:10,773 --> 00:11:12,764
There.

137
00:11:14,533 --> 00:11:18,446
- Victor.
- Ah, my good, good friend.

138
00:11:19,933 --> 00:11:22,891
l never thought l would see you again.

139
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:25,282
- How is your family?
- Eager to see you.

140
00:11:25,373 --> 00:11:29,685
- Ah, soon. ls everything prepared?
- Yes. Please, come in.

141
00:11:29,773 --> 00:11:32,287
Victor, l would like you
to meet my daughter, Mila.

142
00:11:32,373 --> 00:11:34,364
- Mila, right.
- Hello.

143
00:11:34,453 --> 00:11:37,047
- How beautiful.
- Thank you.

144
00:11:37,133 --> 00:11:40,603
- Just like your mother.
- Yes, but she got my temper.

145
00:11:40,693 --> 00:11:43,844
Ah! No good. That is no good.

146
00:11:45,293 --> 00:11:48,046
We have fresh clothes for you,
whenever you're ready.

147
00:11:48,133 --> 00:11:50,727
To you and your family.

148
00:11:55,013 --> 00:11:58,562
- Would you like something to eat, Jack?
- No.

149
00:12:12,973 --> 00:12:18,127
lt makes no sense. How does letting a CTU
agent die help keep Drazen out of the news?

150
00:12:19,733 --> 00:12:24,204
- Teri, l'm busy. Can Nina help you now?
- No. l'm talking to you right now.

151
00:12:25,693 --> 00:12:28,287
Yeah. l'll call you right back, all right?

152
00:12:30,573 --> 00:12:33,087
You are not gonna let my husband die.

153
00:12:33,173 --> 00:12:37,485
No one is gonna let Jack die. We just can't
go through with the trade right now.

154
00:12:37,573 --> 00:12:40,690
There's no difference.
Without your help he has no chance.

155
00:12:40,773 --> 00:12:44,448
With an ordinary agent, l'd agree.
Jack's got a Special Forces background.

156
00:12:44,533 --> 00:12:47,206
- l've seen him do the impossible.
- Stop patronising me.

157
00:12:47,293 --> 00:12:52,845
You've done it all night. Just tell me what
you are prepared to do to help my husband.

158
00:12:52,933 --> 00:12:55,401
Fine. l'll stop patronising you.

159
00:12:55,493 --> 00:12:58,724
l'll tell you exactly what l'll do.
l'm gonna call up Division.

160
00:12:58,813 --> 00:13:02,692
l'm gonna ask them to reconsider
one more time and they're gonna say no

161
00:13:02,773 --> 00:13:05,571
and that'll be the end of it.

162
00:13:07,613 --> 00:13:09,729
Anything else?

163
00:13:22,653 --> 00:13:25,770
Nina. l'm asking you,
someone who cares about Jack,

164
00:13:25,853 --> 00:13:27,923
we cannot just stand by and watch him die.

165
00:13:28,013 --> 00:13:30,527
l know. l agree. l'm doing something about it.

166
00:13:30,613 --> 00:13:33,810
What do you mean? What are you doing?

167
00:13:33,893 --> 00:13:38,171
l think there's someone who can help Jack.
lt's not procedure, so l can't talk about it.

168
00:13:38,253 --> 00:13:41,051
You're just gonna have to trust me.

169
00:13:42,133 --> 00:13:44,328
- OK.
- OK.

170
00:13:44,413 --> 00:13:46,404
(dials phone)

171
00:13:50,573 --> 00:13:53,007
- Palmer campaign.
- This is Nina Myers at CTU.

172
00:13:53,093 --> 00:13:56,130
- l need to talk to Senator Palmer.
- Hold the line, please.

173
00:13:56,213 --> 00:13:57,566
Yes.

174
00:14:05,973 --> 00:14:08,248
No, l can't take all the credit for the speech.

175
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:13,487
Oh, Patty. See, this is the lady you should be
complimenting. We were talking about you.

176
00:14:13,573 --> 00:14:16,292
- Oh, really?
- Yes. They loved the speech tonight.

177
00:14:16,373 --> 00:14:21,242
Now, among other things, Patty's the brain
trust behind most of my public addresses.

178
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:24,564
Excuse me, Senator. Nina Myers at CTU.

179
00:14:24,653 --> 00:14:27,531
- OK?
- Would you excuse me? l have to take this.

180
00:14:28,653 --> 00:14:31,531
- This is David Palmer.
- Thank you for taking my call.

181
00:14:31,613 --> 00:14:33,171
What can l do for you?

182
00:14:33,253 --> 00:14:36,086
- Jack's in trouble. He needs help.
- What kind of trouble?

183
00:14:36,173 --> 00:14:39,802
There's no time to catch up with everything.
Let me give you the headlines.

184
00:14:39,893 --> 00:14:41,451
Victor Drazen is alive.

185
00:14:41,533 --> 00:14:44,889
- Whoa, whoa. What do you mean, he's alive?
- That's all we know.

186
00:14:44,973 --> 00:14:49,524
He was being held prisoner by the US
government up until about an hour ago.

187
00:14:50,413 --> 00:14:52,927
OK. What happened an hour ago?

188
00:14:53,013 --> 00:14:57,325
He escaped and he's taken Jack hostage.
He's willing to trade Jack for his son.

189
00:14:57,413 --> 00:15:02,123
- What's DOD's response?
- They're refusing to get directly involved.

190
00:15:02,773 --> 00:15:05,446
- Who knows you contacted me?
- No one.

191
00:15:05,533 --> 00:15:08,286
- All right. Who's talking to Drazen?
- George Mason.

192
00:15:08,373 --> 00:15:10,933
- Tell me about him.
- Normally he's by the book.

193
00:15:11,013 --> 00:15:14,483
- But he's very ambitious and very political.
- OK.

194
00:15:14,573 --> 00:15:17,770
Look, l'm gonna make a few calls first.
Where can l reach Mason?

195
00:15:17,853 --> 00:15:20,686
Here at CTU. He's in Jack's office.

196
00:15:20,773 --> 00:15:23,367
- All right.
- Thank you, Senator.

197
00:15:26,413 --> 00:15:28,404
Are you sure?

198
00:15:29,493 --> 00:15:31,484
OK.

199
00:15:36,373 --> 00:15:38,728
- Tony.
- What's up?

200
00:15:39,453 --> 00:15:43,332
Kim's car was hit.
Two cops are down and she was taken.

201
00:15:43,413 --> 00:15:45,768
- What?
- Yeah.

202
00:15:48,933 --> 00:15:51,811
Was there any communication?
Any witnesses?

203
00:15:51,893 --> 00:15:54,407
They're working it up now.

204
00:15:54,493 --> 00:15:57,087
All right. Let me know what you find out.

205
00:16:02,973 --> 00:16:06,170
Tony, l'm gonna need
to talk to you in a few minutes.

206
00:16:08,973 --> 00:16:10,964
- Tony?
- What?

207
00:16:12,093 --> 00:16:15,051
- You all right?
- No. We got a problem.

208
00:16:15,133 --> 00:16:17,772
Hey. Any word on Kim?

209
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:23,292
- Uh, l was just about to check.
- Well, she should be here any minute, right?

210
00:16:23,373 --> 00:16:25,364
Yeah.

211
00:16:26,293 --> 00:16:30,730
Teri, l'm sorry. Do you mind
waiting in the conference room?

212
00:16:30,813 --> 00:16:32,804
- Sure.
- Thanks.

213
00:16:36,573 --> 00:16:40,646
- What's going on?
- They grabbed Kim again.

214
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:42,849
- What?
- lt must have been Drazen.

215
00:16:42,933 --> 00:16:47,370
- The patrol car she was riding in was hit.
- l don't believe this.

216
00:16:49,413 --> 00:16:52,007
Are you gonna tell her?

217
00:17:05,533 --> 00:17:07,524
(phone rings)

218
00:17:10,493 --> 00:17:13,769
- Mason.
- (woman) l have Senator Palmer on the line.

219
00:17:13,853 --> 00:17:16,526
Oh, yeah. Put him through.

220
00:17:17,133 --> 00:17:17,963
Hello.

221
00:17:18,053 --> 00:17:21,443
Senator, this is George Mason.
lt's an honour to speak to you, sir.

222
00:17:21,533 --> 00:17:25,572
l want you to reverse your orders
on the Bauer-for-Drazen trade.

223
00:17:25,653 --> 00:17:30,602
Uh, l'm not sure how much information you
have about this, but this is agency business

224
00:17:30,693 --> 00:17:34,572
and, with all due respect,
it doesn't fall under the Senate's purview.

225
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:39,090
As you well know, Mr Mason, your entire
agency falls under presidential purview

226
00:17:39,173 --> 00:17:41,448
and in nine months l will be in that office.

227
00:17:41,533 --> 00:17:44,001
l'm not sure if that's meant
to tempt or threaten me.

228
00:17:44,093 --> 00:17:48,848
lt doesn't matter either way because l don't
have the authority to pull the trigger on this.

229
00:17:48,933 --> 00:17:52,892
From what l'm told, that authority
is something you'd like to have some day.

230
00:17:52,973 --> 00:17:55,123
What's that supposed to mean?

231
00:17:55,213 --> 00:17:58,444
Act on your own prerogative.
Go through with the trade.

232
00:17:58,533 --> 00:18:02,003
You'll be reprimanded,
possibly even demoted.

233
00:18:02,093 --> 00:18:04,527
So far it sounds great.

234
00:18:04,613 --> 00:18:08,925
ln the first month of my term l'll instate you
in a high-level position in Washington.

235
00:18:09,013 --> 00:18:11,607
You'll bypass five years
of middle management.

236
00:18:11,693 --> 00:18:14,002
And if you don't get elected?

237
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:17,130
That's not gonna happen.
Think about it, George.

238
00:18:28,013 --> 00:18:32,450
- Transportation has been arranged.
- Problems with last-minute changes?

239
00:18:32,533 --> 00:18:34,603
- lt's going to cost more.
- How much?

240
00:18:34,693 --> 00:18:36,684
200,000.

241
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:39,927
You should try, Jack, the borek.

242
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:43,925
- lt is wonderful.
- Do you need anything else?

243
00:18:44,013 --> 00:18:46,208
No. Everything is perfect.

244
00:18:46,973 --> 00:18:49,567
My father told me to take good care of you.

245
00:18:49,653 --> 00:18:54,488
The service was impeccable
and my compliments to the chef.

246
00:18:55,013 --> 00:18:57,447
Thank you. lt was my mother's recipe.

247
00:19:03,253 --> 00:19:06,325
Drop the weapons! Drop the weapons!

248
00:19:07,653 --> 00:19:11,407
Put your weapons down!
Put your weapons down or l'll cut her throat!

249
00:19:11,493 --> 00:19:13,449
Drop the weapons!

250
00:19:15,453 --> 00:19:17,523
Put them down.

251
00:19:18,053 --> 00:19:20,647
- You too, Victor.
- Of course.

252
00:19:21,613 --> 00:19:23,365
Drop the weapon!

253
00:19:28,813 --> 00:19:30,531
You son of a bitch.

254
00:19:30,613 --> 00:19:34,322
- One more death for you to atone for, Jack.
- You son of a bitch!

255
00:19:34,413 --> 00:19:37,132
How could you do this?

256
00:19:37,693 --> 00:19:40,526
- What happened?
- Call CTU now.

257
00:19:40,613 --> 00:19:43,810
Tell them l want your brother
Alexis here now.

258
00:19:43,893 --> 00:19:48,205
Tie his hands behind his back.
And keep her father away from here.

259
00:19:48,293 --> 00:19:52,684
You're supposed to be watching him.
What am l paying you for?

260
00:20:05,973 --> 00:20:08,282
- Where's Teri?
- ln the conference room.

261
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:10,364
(phone rings)

262
00:20:11,453 --> 00:20:12,681
Mason.

263
00:20:12,773 --> 00:20:15,571
Mr Mason. What have you decided?

264
00:20:18,253 --> 00:20:20,244
Mr Mason?

265
00:20:21,493 --> 00:20:24,246
We're gonna do the swap on our terms.

266
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:30,090
Yeah, that's an interesting dream. The swap
will take place exactly 30 minutes from now.

267
00:20:30,173 --> 00:20:35,725
The address is 2127 Grand Avenue.
A green SUV will be waiting.

268
00:20:35,813 --> 00:20:39,203
- Place my brother inside the vehicle.
- What about Jack?

269
00:20:39,293 --> 00:20:42,729
When my brother's in position
l'll direct you to Bauer.

270
00:20:43,853 --> 00:20:46,731
You have 29 minutes.

271
00:20:46,813 --> 00:20:49,327
l got it. 2127 Grand Avenue.

272
00:20:50,013 --> 00:20:54,245
- lt's a repair garage.
- Get ahold of Chris Porterfield at LAPD.

273
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:57,450
Tell him we're taking over the streets
in that area for two hours.

274
00:20:57,533 --> 00:21:00,366
- Where are you going?
- The hospital, to get Alexis.

275
00:21:00,453 --> 00:21:03,126
He just got stabbed.
They're not gonna let him out.

276
00:21:03,213 --> 00:21:05,807
They're gonna have to.

277
00:21:09,613 --> 00:21:13,049
Oh, no, don't worry. My name's
not gonna be even close to this.

278
00:21:13,133 --> 00:21:15,567
(man) This conversation has
to end between us two.

279
00:21:15,653 --> 00:21:17,689
- l agree.
- OK, then.

280
00:21:17,773 --> 00:21:20,162
- Look, l gotta get back.
- We're clear?

281
00:21:20,253 --> 00:21:22,244
Yeah.

282
00:21:32,933 --> 00:21:35,401
There you are. David, where have you been?

283
00:21:36,573 --> 00:21:38,245
l had to make some calls.

284
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:40,403
Just in case you haven't noticed,

285
00:21:40,493 --> 00:21:44,406
everyone is here to see you. You need
to make an impression, not phone calls.

286
00:21:44,493 --> 00:21:46,961
- l know what l have to do, Sherry.
- Do you really?

287
00:21:47,053 --> 00:21:50,125
Don't talk down to me, Sherry. l don't like it.

288
00:21:50,213 --> 00:21:53,808
l hope the weakness you've shown today
is because you missed a night's sleep

289
00:21:53,893 --> 00:21:55,929
and you'll be back on your game tomorrow.

290
00:21:56,013 --> 00:22:00,803
Otherwise we will be buried
before this election even happens.

291
00:22:04,853 --> 00:22:07,572
Steven! No, stay. l'll be over.

292
00:22:07,653 --> 00:22:09,609
Get to work.

293
00:22:15,773 --> 00:22:19,448
Senator? The Wall Street Journal
had a couple of questions for you.

294
00:22:19,533 --> 00:22:23,208
l put together some past quotes
so you wouldn't have to bother with it.

295
00:22:23,293 --> 00:22:26,205
l... l hope that's all right.

296
00:22:26,293 --> 00:22:28,284
Sure.

297
00:22:30,453 --> 00:22:32,523
Well, don't you look gorgeous tonight?

298
00:22:32,613 --> 00:22:36,083
- You've seen this before.
- lt's not just the dress.

299
00:22:36,173 --> 00:22:37,322
Thank you.

300
00:22:39,773 --> 00:22:44,608
Patty, l've been thinking. Since this incident
with Keith is out in the open,

301
00:22:44,693 --> 00:22:48,527
it's gonna shift the focus of every interview,
every press conference.

302
00:22:48,613 --> 00:22:53,084
Yeah. l've already started a Q and A of all the
questions to expect over the next few days.

303
00:22:53,173 --> 00:22:57,325
- Have you talked to Mike about this?
- Not yet. l need a little more time to prepare.

304
00:22:57,413 --> 00:23:01,088
- l'd like to see whatever you have so far.
- Sure. Whenever you want.

305
00:23:01,173 --> 00:23:03,164
How about now?

306
00:23:03,893 --> 00:23:05,645
- Now?
- Yeah.

307
00:23:05,733 --> 00:23:08,964
Everybody seems to be having
a good time. There's an open bar.

308
00:23:09,053 --> 00:23:12,762
- l doubt anyone will even notice l'm gone.
- l doubt that's true, Senator.

309
00:23:12,853 --> 00:23:16,926
ln any event, l could use some quiet time.
Stay here. Tell me where your notes are.

310
00:23:17,013 --> 00:23:21,962
lf you don't mind, l'd rather walk you through
it. lt would make more sense to you that way.

311
00:23:22,053 --> 00:23:26,763
OK. Why don't you meet me
upstairs in, say, five minutes?

312
00:23:26,853 --> 00:23:28,844
Sure.

313
00:23:37,653 --> 00:23:39,530
(sobbing)

314
00:23:39,613 --> 00:23:41,012
Ah.

315
00:23:41,093 --> 00:23:43,084
My dear friend.

316
00:23:43,973 --> 00:23:47,602
lt's not what you think.
l have lost my wife and daughter.

317
00:23:47,693 --> 00:23:52,608
You, both of your brothers and now Mila.
This is what our enemies have done to us.

318
00:23:52,693 --> 00:23:55,890
He would have killed her,
and not in a merciful way.

319
00:24:07,093 --> 00:24:12,372
How could you do this, murderer?

320
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:17,047
You killed my daughter.

321
00:24:18,373 --> 00:24:21,012
You killed my daughter!

322
00:24:21,093 --> 00:24:23,482
You murderer! You...

323
00:24:28,013 --> 00:24:31,483
- (Andre) We have to get out of here.
- Kim!

324
00:24:31,573 --> 00:24:33,962
(Andre) Get him in the van.

325
00:24:34,053 --> 00:24:36,044
(speak in Serbian)

326
00:24:41,733 --> 00:24:44,042
Get this place cleaned out.

327
00:25:07,053 --> 00:25:10,125
Nina. What's happening?
Are they gonna help Jack?

328
00:25:10,213 --> 00:25:12,773
- Yes. They're gonna trade.
- That's good, isn't it?

329
00:25:12,853 --> 00:25:15,606
- What do you think? Will he be safe?
- l think so.

330
00:25:15,693 --> 00:25:19,003
Victor wants his son back,
so l don't think he'll pull anything.

331
00:25:19,093 --> 00:25:21,607
Oh, thank God.
And when's this gonna happen?

332
00:25:21,693 --> 00:25:25,163
10, 15 minutes.
Mason's already left to pick up Alexis.

333
00:25:25,253 --> 00:25:28,962
That's so good. l can hardly wait
for this whole thing to be over.

334
00:25:29,053 --> 00:25:32,728
l think when Jack and Kim arrive,
l'll just have to collapse in a big heap.

335
00:25:32,813 --> 00:25:35,202
- Do you need anything else?
- Um...

336
00:25:35,293 --> 00:25:38,808
Actually, there is one thing.
l know Kim's on her way over here

337
00:25:38,893 --> 00:25:41,566
but l'd feel better if l could
speak to her on the phone.

338
00:25:41,653 --> 00:25:44,770
ls there any way you could patch me
through to the police car?

339
00:25:44,853 --> 00:25:49,369
We were so busy tracking Jack, l didn't
have a chance to check on them. Um...

340
00:25:49,453 --> 00:25:53,492
- Yeah, let me see if that's possible.
- Thank you. Nina.

341
00:25:54,773 --> 00:25:58,561
l know it's been a really long day for you too,
and l guess l want you to know

342
00:25:58,653 --> 00:26:02,851
how much l appreciate your being
up front with me about everything.

343
00:26:06,413 --> 00:26:08,290
Sure.

344
00:26:23,213 --> 00:26:25,807
l couldn't tell her.

345
00:26:29,933 --> 00:26:33,812
l just couldn't
after everything she's been through.

346
00:26:33,893 --> 00:26:35,884
l understand.

347
00:26:45,893 --> 00:26:47,451
You OK?

348
00:26:47,533 --> 00:26:49,524
l just...

349
00:26:49,613 --> 00:26:52,685
l just feel like l'm not doing my job.

350
00:26:52,773 --> 00:26:56,527
Look, there's nothing wrong with
the way you're doing your job, OK?

351
00:26:56,613 --> 00:27:00,162
l mean, ultimately, we're here
to try to help people, right?

352
00:27:00,253 --> 00:27:03,370
l don't know anybody
who does that better than you.

353
00:27:06,293 --> 00:27:08,284
Thanks.

354
00:27:10,493 --> 00:27:12,484
You're welcome.

355
00:27:22,653 --> 00:27:26,441
(Jack) You gotta let my daughter go.
She's got nothing to do with this.

356
00:27:26,533 --> 00:27:30,412
You want me to do something for you,
l'll do it, but let my daughter go. l'm not...

357
00:27:30,493 --> 00:27:36,045
After what you have done, l should kill you
and your daughter right now. Don't test me.

358
00:27:38,213 --> 00:27:40,727
You're not thinking this through, Andre.

359
00:27:40,813 --> 00:27:43,964
You have a chance to get out
with your brother and father alive.

360
00:27:44,053 --> 00:27:47,443
- You kill innocents, they'll never let you...
- Enough!

361
00:27:47,533 --> 00:27:52,482
Your best tactic right now, Mr Bauer,
is to be quiet and let my father rest.

362
00:27:54,893 --> 00:27:55,769
OK.

363
00:28:07,573 --> 00:28:09,643
OK, here's how l broke it down.

364
00:28:09,733 --> 00:28:14,170
There are gonna be questions about
the night Keith went to see Lyle Gibson.

365
00:28:14,253 --> 00:28:16,767
What happened? Why was he there?

366
00:28:16,853 --> 00:28:18,844
Why was his death covered up?

367
00:28:18,933 --> 00:28:22,608
Whoa, whoa. Let's be careful
when we mention ''cover-up''.

368
00:28:23,653 --> 00:28:26,451
When we talk about this,
we say ''failed to come forth''.

369
00:28:26,533 --> 00:28:28,649
lt's a good point.

370
00:28:28,733 --> 00:28:34,729
OK. Which leads me to the second group
of questions: who knew and who didn't?

371
00:28:34,933 --> 00:28:39,085
Did you know? lf not, who did know
and tried to keep it from you?

372
00:28:39,173 --> 00:28:41,164
Good. Good. What else?

373
00:28:41,253 --> 00:28:44,450
Ferragamo's death.
Now, that is gonna be a hot story.

374
00:28:44,533 --> 00:28:47,730
- There'll be lots of room for speculation.
- Look, look, look...

375
00:28:47,813 --> 00:28:51,283
All l care about with Ferragamo
is that the public knows,

376
00:28:51,373 --> 00:28:55,525
in no uncertain terms, that Carl and the
Latham Group acted outside our influence.

377
00:28:55,613 --> 00:29:00,733
No, they will. Mike's already started setting
up interviews with all the major papers.

378
00:29:00,813 --> 00:29:02,929
He's clearing up points with your attorney.

379
00:29:03,013 --> 00:29:06,722
By the morning you should be able
to speak freely and get the word out.

380
00:29:06,813 --> 00:29:11,284
- When did you have time to do all this?
- ln the last couple of hours.

381
00:29:13,693 --> 00:29:15,923
You wrote two speeches for me today.

382
00:29:16,013 --> 00:29:19,608
lf l don't help you get into the White House,
l'm out of a job.

383
00:29:23,213 --> 00:29:26,125
- Would you care for a glass of champagne?
- Sure.

384
00:29:29,733 --> 00:29:33,169
- When do you find time for a life?
- Well, this is my life.

385
00:29:33,853 --> 00:29:37,129
Oh, no, no, no. l mean a boyfriend. Friends.

386
00:29:37,213 --> 00:29:39,932
Ah. l know. l should get out more.

387
00:29:40,013 --> 00:29:42,004
Yeah, you should.

388
00:29:43,693 --> 00:29:45,604
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

389
00:29:45,693 --> 00:29:47,649
You're welcome.

390
00:29:49,493 --> 00:29:50,972
Cheers.

391
00:29:51,053 --> 00:29:53,613
Mm. What are we drinking to?

392
00:29:54,293 --> 00:29:56,568
To taking five minutes off, starting now.

393
00:29:56,653 --> 00:29:59,725
- Mm, well. Hear, hear.
- Hear, hear.

394
00:30:06,893 --> 00:30:11,091
So, um, you and Sherry
were childhood sweethearts?

395
00:30:12,733 --> 00:30:14,724
That's right.

396
00:30:15,973 --> 00:30:19,090
And there's never been anyone else?

397
00:30:19,173 --> 00:30:22,609
l'm running for president, Patty.
l can't answer that.

398
00:30:23,933 --> 00:30:25,969
Come on.

399
00:30:31,173 --> 00:30:34,324
Are you flirting with me, Patty?

400
00:30:34,413 --> 00:30:37,211
l don't know. l think l might be.

401
00:30:41,493 --> 00:30:47,204
This is good. Tell Mike l wanna meet
with him on this first thing in the morning.

402
00:30:47,293 --> 00:30:51,081
l want you there. Call Everly.
Someone from legal should be there too.

403
00:30:51,173 --> 00:30:53,164
- Done.
- And...

404
00:30:53,973 --> 00:30:57,727
it wouldn't hurt to put in
a little more face time downstairs.

405
00:30:57,813 --> 00:31:00,486
l think you might be right.

406
00:31:00,573 --> 00:31:02,529
- Shall we?
- Yes.

407
00:31:34,413 --> 00:31:36,404
(Jack grunts)

408
00:31:38,413 --> 00:31:40,404
Wait here, Father.

409
00:31:51,253 --> 00:31:53,244
(Jack groans)

410
00:31:56,693 --> 00:32:00,129
lf your people deliver my brother
as promised, you'll live.

411
00:32:00,213 --> 00:32:02,363
lf not, then you'll die here.

412
00:32:05,493 --> 00:32:08,565
There are sniper rifles
currently aiming at you.

413
00:32:08,653 --> 00:32:11,963
- They await my instructions.
- What about my daughter?

414
00:32:12,053 --> 00:32:16,285
You'll hear from us when this is over -
if you make it that far -

415
00:32:16,373 --> 00:32:20,366
and to dissuade you from wasting
valuable time trying to trace,

416
00:32:20,453 --> 00:32:22,762
l prepared a scrambled phone.

417
00:32:23,853 --> 00:32:26,447
What do you want me to do?

418
00:32:27,253 --> 00:32:29,244
Not yet.

419
00:32:34,133 --> 00:32:36,647
What do you want me to do?!

420
00:33:15,293 --> 00:33:18,126
- Oh, Senator.
- Hey, John. Thanks for coming.

421
00:33:19,013 --> 00:33:23,131
Hey, Michael. Thanks for coming.
Look at you. Don't you look nice?

422
00:33:23,933 --> 00:33:25,332
- Sir.
- Hey, how are you?

423
00:33:25,413 --> 00:33:27,404
Senator.

424
00:33:29,693 --> 00:33:31,684
There you are. l'd like for you to meet

425
00:33:31,773 --> 00:33:35,891
Doctors Bryan Chasin
and Darrell Maines from UCLA.

426
00:33:35,973 --> 00:33:40,444
Yes, of course. You're the gentlemen doing
such wonderful work in AlDS research.

427
00:33:40,533 --> 00:33:42,842
Sweetheart, l need to look after something.

428
00:33:42,933 --> 00:33:44,924
- Uh-huh.
- Excuse me.

429
00:33:46,493 --> 00:33:51,169
So, what isn't the government doing
for you that we could fix next term?

430
00:34:04,293 --> 00:34:06,204
Patty?

431
00:34:06,293 --> 00:34:09,603
- Hi.
- You were upstairs with David, weren't you?

432
00:34:11,653 --> 00:34:13,644
Yes.

433
00:34:14,333 --> 00:34:16,642
Good. What happened?

434
00:34:18,213 --> 00:34:21,011
- l did what you told me.
- And?

435
00:34:21,773 --> 00:34:27,086
l think it's working. Mrs Palmer,
l'm not sure where all of this is going.

436
00:34:28,133 --> 00:34:33,332
All you need to know is that this is for his
own good and for the good of his campaign.

437
00:34:35,293 --> 00:34:40,287
What's the problem? l thought you liked
David. This shouldn't be a tough assignment.

438
00:34:40,373 --> 00:34:43,046
l do like him.

439
00:34:43,133 --> 00:34:46,091
lt's just hard for me to deceive him like this.

440
00:34:50,653 --> 00:34:53,531
l understand your hesitation.

441
00:34:53,613 --> 00:34:59,449
But l know my husband better than anybody
and he needs someone like you right now.

442
00:35:01,053 --> 00:35:04,443
But it's gonna lead
to other things, Mrs Palmer.

443
00:35:04,533 --> 00:35:08,048
Well, we'll just deal with that
when the time comes.

444
00:35:08,133 --> 00:35:10,124
Oh, cherries. Mm.

445
00:35:11,413 --> 00:35:13,404
Thanks.

446
00:35:57,293 --> 00:35:59,045
Everyone in position.

447
00:36:20,373 --> 00:36:24,844
OK, we're here. Stay outside the perimeter.
Let's just get in and get out.

448
00:36:32,133 --> 00:36:35,921
- Here's Alexis. Where's Jack?
- What's wrong with him?

449
00:36:36,013 --> 00:36:39,289
- Nothing. He'll be fine.
- Alexis, are you all right?

450
00:36:44,933 --> 00:36:47,083
(phone rings)

451
00:36:47,173 --> 00:36:49,209
- Yes.
- Alexis is hurt.

452
00:36:49,293 --> 00:36:51,011
- How badly?
- Worse than we thought.

453
00:36:51,093 --> 00:36:52,970
He's fine.

454
00:36:53,053 --> 00:36:56,682
- We need a doctor.
- l'll have one there when you arrive. Go.

455
00:36:59,693 --> 00:37:03,129
- What are we doing here?
- Once we're satisfied you're not following us,

456
00:37:03,213 --> 00:37:08,003
- we'll give you Jack's location.
- That's unacceptable. We need to know now.

457
00:37:09,893 --> 00:37:12,487
Hold it right there.

458
00:37:12,573 --> 00:37:15,371
Move to second position. We have a problem.

459
00:37:21,093 --> 00:37:23,288
Are you going to shoot me?

460
00:37:23,373 --> 00:37:27,525
You should have taken more English lessons.
''Trade'' means we get something too.

461
00:37:27,613 --> 00:37:30,605
l want Jack now
or you're all coming back with us.

462
00:37:33,333 --> 00:37:36,450
We have Jack's daughter.
You must know that by now.

463
00:37:37,653 --> 00:37:40,008
What are you saying?
We get Jack and Kimberly?

464
00:37:40,093 --> 00:37:44,928
My English is clear. You're going
to get back Jack, as discussed.

465
00:37:45,653 --> 00:37:48,645
- What about the daughter?
- That's not my concern.

466
00:37:51,053 --> 00:37:54,170
l need to talk to Drazen.

467
00:37:54,253 --> 00:37:57,484
lf you keep holding me here,
l can't return Alexis to his father.

468
00:37:57,573 --> 00:38:00,167
We are on a schedule, remember?

469
00:38:08,053 --> 00:38:12,285
All right. Move back to the perimeter.
We're gonna have to let 'em go.

470
00:38:19,613 --> 00:38:22,252
We'll be waiting to hear from you.

471
00:38:32,933 --> 00:38:36,482
- (Mason) Nina, do you copy?
- Yeah, l have 'em.

472
00:38:38,893 --> 00:38:41,805
Soon as we get Jack we'll take them down.

473
00:38:41,893 --> 00:38:44,487
OK. We're standing by.

474
00:39:38,693 --> 00:39:40,684
(beeping)

475
00:39:43,853 --> 00:39:45,844
(beeping speeds up)

476
00:40:00,973 --> 00:40:03,009
Dammit.

477
00:40:03,093 --> 00:40:06,449
- What's wrong?
- They found the tracker. We lost 'em.

478
00:40:34,573 --> 00:40:36,564
(phone rings)

479
00:40:38,053 --> 00:40:41,284
- Yeah.
- (Andre) South ofthe platform there's a car.

480
00:40:41,373 --> 00:40:46,083
lfyou want to see Kim alive, talk to no one,
get into it, head towards Century City.

481
00:40:46,173 --> 00:40:48,164
Wait, wait.
