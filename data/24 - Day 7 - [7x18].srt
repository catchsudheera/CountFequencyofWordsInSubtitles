Episode 18

4
00:00:10,632 --> 00:00:12,632
Previously on 24 ...

5
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:15,031
Mr. Knowles, my name is Jack Bauer.

6
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:16,798
Jonas Hodges is in possession

7
00:00:16,866 --> 00:00:18,967
of a military-grade bioweapon.

8
00:00:19,036 --> 00:00:20,990
I was contaminated when
trying to intercept the canisters.

9
00:00:21,005 --> 00:00:23,050
I promise you, sir,
the weapon is on your base.

10
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,500
Do you have any idea
where they might be?

11
00:00:24,542 --> 00:00:25,942
Think I might.

12
00:00:26,009 --> 00:00:29,211
I have an order from the president of the united states.

13
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:30,513
To search this building.

14
00:00:30,581 --> 00:00:32,114
Are there weapons of mass destruction?

15
00:00:32,182 --> 00:00:33,683
Are there weapons of any kind?

16
00:00:33,751 --> 00:00:34,918
You've got five minutes

17
00:00:34,985 --> 00:00:37,086
to get these helicopters flying out of here.

18
00:00:37,154 --> 00:00:38,521
With all of you on board.

19
00:00:38,589 --> 00:00:39,756
Larry, I want you and your men

20
00:00:39,824 --> 00:00:41,190
to pull out on Hodges' timetable.

21
00:00:41,258 --> 00:00:42,925
Tony, you're gonna need to find a way to stay behind.

22
00:00:42,993 --> 00:00:44,827
We're gonna get your vectors over to a man

23
00:00:44,895 --> 00:00:46,163
that we contacted inside Starkwood.

24
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:47,330
His name is Dougles Knowles.

25
00:00:47,398 --> 00:00:48,831
He believes he knows where the weapons are.

26
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:51,434
Stay here. I'll be right back.

27
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:54,671
Jack!

28
00:00:54,738 --> 00:00:56,139
We need a medic!

29
00:00:56,507 --> 00:00:58,441
The bioagent is more virulent than we thought.

30
00:00:58,509 --> 00:01:00,276
All we're doing here is just
masking the symptoms.

31
00:01:00,343 --> 00:01:01,978
I understand.

32
00:01:03,013 --> 00:01:04,280
There's something you may want to consider.

33
00:01:04,348 --> 00:01:05,548
What's that?

34
00:01:05,616 --> 00:01:06,583
A possible treatment using stem cells

35
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:08,250
from a genetically compatible donor.

36
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:09,552
I saw your file, and it says

37
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:10,720
you have a daughter.

38
00:01:10,788 --> 00:01:12,957
I don't want my daughter involved in this.

39
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Jack.

40
00:01:14,024 --> 00:01:15,992
It should be her choice.

41
00:01:16,059 --> 00:01:17,093
Well, it's not.

42
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,761
I'm the one who's dying.

43
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:19,996
I'm in.

44
00:01:20,063 --> 00:01:21,598
But they got Knowles.

45
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:23,466
A little loyalty.

46
00:01:23,534 --> 00:01:25,267
Wasn't that the least I deserved?

47
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:27,704
You can't take on the federal government.

48
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:34,477
I have a visual on the weapon.

49
00:01:34,545 --> 00:01:35,912
Okay, those are the canisters.

50
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:38,981
I'll notify Admiral Smith the
target is located and confirmed

51
00:01:39,049 --> 00:01:41,951
You remember Starkwood was deployed to Pakistan?

52
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:44,787
That we requisitioned a missile system at that time.

53
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:47,356
Well, three of those missiles

54
00:01:47,424 --> 00:01:48,858
are now loaded with a pathogen

55
00:01:48,926 --> 00:01:51,995
and aimed at cities on our eastern seaboard.

56
00:01:52,062 --> 00:01:53,997
You will keep this conversation to yourself

57
00:01:54,064 --> 00:01:55,197
and turn the planes around.

58
00:01:55,265 --> 00:01:57,634
And if you do not comply, madam president,

59
00:01:57,701 --> 00:01:59,368
I will have no choice

60
00:01:59,436 --> 00:02:01,170
but to launch those missiles.

61
00:02:01,238 --> 00:02:02,700
Abort the air strike, Admiral Smith.

62
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:03,840
Ma'am, with all respect ...

63
00:02:03,908 --> 00:02:04,874
Damn it, admiral.

64
00:02:04,942 --> 00:02:07,077
Abort the air strike immediately!

65
00:02:08,578 --> 00:02:13,578
The following takes place
between 01:00 A.M. and 02:00 A.M.

66
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:36,405
Tony, it's Jack.

67
00:02:36,473 --> 00:02:37,574
Do you copy?

68
00:02:37,641 --> 00:02:39,042
Jack, what the hell is going on?

69
00:02:39,109 --> 00:02:40,309
Where are those F-18s?

70
00:02:40,377 --> 00:02:42,178
Tim Woods just called from the white house.

71
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:43,980
The president canceled the air strike.

72
00:02:44,048 --> 00:02:45,014
What?

73
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:46,082
Why?

74
00:02:46,149 --> 00:02:49,285
She doesn't believe our intel is
strong enough to justify military action.

75
00:02:49,352 --> 00:02:50,987
Is she out of her mind?

76
00:02:51,055 --> 00:02:53,189
Jack, I saw those canisters
with my own eyes.

77
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:54,724
So did you.
They're in that bunker.

78
00:02:54,792 --> 00:02:57,326
- She's not gonna get any better intel than that.
- I know.

79
00:02:57,394 --> 00:02:58,728
It doesn't make any sense, but right now,

80
00:02:58,796 --> 00:03:00,296
we've got a presidential order to pull you out

81
00:03:00,363 --> 00:03:01,864
of the Starkwood compound,
along with the perimeter teams.

82
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:03,332
Tony, Larry's been told
the president's decision.

83
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,568
He's preparing to move
his teams out, but he's got

84
00:03:05,636 --> 00:03:07,036
to get you out of there first.

85
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:09,105
He'll be sending you coordinates
for an exfiltration point

86
00:03:09,172 --> 00:03:11,373
along the southwest perimeter.

87
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:12,675
Tony?

88
00:03:12,743 --> 00:03:14,744
Hold on a second.

89
00:03:22,052 --> 00:03:23,753
Tony, what's going on?

90
00:03:23,821 --> 00:03:25,454
Jack, I might know

91
00:03:25,522 --> 00:03:27,490
why the president called off that air strike.

92
00:03:27,557 --> 00:03:29,025
What do you mean?

93
00:03:29,093 --> 00:03:32,561
I think Starkwood's got surface-to-surface missiles.

94
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:34,330
That's how they're gonna deploy the bioweapon.

95
00:03:34,397 --> 00:03:35,865
How do you know this?

96
00:03:35,933 --> 00:03:38,101
A fuel truck just pulled up next to the bunker

97
00:03:38,168 --> 00:03:39,335
where they're storing the weapons.

98
00:03:41,071 --> 00:03:44,040
They're pumping RP-7 into an underground depot.

99
00:03:44,108 --> 00:03:45,742
What's RP-7?

100
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:48,277
It's a propellant only used in
surface-to-surface missiles.

101
00:03:48,345 --> 00:03:49,478
Tony, are you sure?

102
00:03:49,546 --> 00:03:50,980
I'm looking right at it, Jack.

103
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:54,984
Do you have any C-4 on you?

104
00:03:55,052 --> 00:03:56,619
Yeah, I've got three charges
and a remote detonator.

105
00:03:56,687 --> 00:03:59,722
Do you think you can gain access to
the underground fuel depot?

106
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:01,257
Yeah, I think we've got a play,

107
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:02,892
but I've got to move soon ...

108
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,661
Before that fuel truck pulls away.

109
00:04:04,728 --> 00:04:06,295
Okay, I want you to maintain your position.

110
00:04:06,363 --> 00:04:07,664
I'm gonna call the president.

111
00:04:07,731 --> 00:04:09,699
Come with me.

112
00:04:13,871 --> 00:04:15,772
What is it, Tim?

113
00:04:17,941 --> 00:04:19,976
Madam president, the joint chiefs

114
00:04:20,044 --> 00:04:21,577
are beginning to question your decision

115
00:04:21,645 --> 00:04:24,513
to call off the air strike against Starkwood.

116
00:04:24,581 --> 00:04:27,016
They think the intelligence
we received from Tony Almeida

117
00:04:27,084 --> 00:04:29,185
was sufficient and that we may be missing

118
00:04:29,252 --> 00:04:30,586
an opportunity to destroy the bioweapons.

119
00:04:30,654 --> 00:04:32,621
I gave my orders, Tim.

120
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:34,256
No air strike.

121
00:04:34,324 --> 00:04:37,794
No military action of any kind
against Starkwood.

122
00:04:39,262 --> 00:04:40,629
Now, I asked you to handle

123
00:04:40,698 --> 00:04:42,131
the joint chiefs.
Handle them.

124
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:43,365
I'll do my best, ma'am,

125
00:04:43,433 --> 00:04:44,600
but if I may...

126
00:04:44,668 --> 00:04:46,368
What is our next move?

127
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:51,507
Jonas Hodges is coming to the white house.

128
00:04:52,676 --> 00:04:54,977
He wants to speak with me alone.

129
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:58,114
- For what possible reason?
- I don't know.

130
00:04:58,182 --> 00:04:59,716
Madam president, shouldn't your advisors

131
00:04:59,783 --> 00:05:00,717
be at that meeting?

132
00:05:00,784 --> 00:05:02,685
Tim, stop asking me questions.

133
00:05:06,123 --> 00:05:07,757
If you want to help,

134
00:05:07,825 --> 00:05:09,792
make sure as few people as possible know

135
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,393
that Jonas Hodges is coming here.

136
00:05:11,461 --> 00:05:13,062
And bring him in

137
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:15,798
through the southeast service entrance.

138
00:05:17,201 --> 00:05:18,134
Yes?

139
00:05:18,202 --> 00:05:19,501
Madam president, Jack Bauer

140
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:21,037
and Renee Walker are calling from FBI.

141
00:05:21,105 --> 00:05:22,205
You did speak to FBI?

142
00:05:22,272 --> 00:05:24,573
Yes, ma'am, five minutes ago.

143
00:05:24,641 --> 00:05:26,075
I gave them your reason for calling off

144
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:27,643
the air strike, but I must warn you,

145
00:05:27,711 --> 00:05:29,078
they were skeptical as well.

146
00:05:29,146 --> 00:05:31,047
Be ready for Hodges.

147
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:38,320
Mr. Bauer,

148
00:05:38,388 --> 00:05:39,856
Agent Walker, this is the president.

149
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:41,423
Madam president, we need to talk.

150
00:05:41,491 --> 00:05:43,726
No, Mr. Bauer, we don't.

151
00:05:43,794 --> 00:05:44,894
You need to listen.

152
00:05:44,962 --> 00:05:46,562
I appreciate everything that you have done

153
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:47,864
in gathering this intel,

154
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:49,065
but I still need more

155
00:05:49,133 --> 00:05:51,000
before I can authorize an air strike.

156
00:05:51,068 --> 00:05:52,001
I'm sorry.

157
00:05:52,069 --> 00:05:53,335
Madam president, with all due respect,

158
00:05:53,403 --> 00:05:54,570
I don't believe you're being truthful

159
00:05:54,638 --> 00:05:56,806
with us.

160
00:05:56,874 --> 00:05:58,340
Excuse me?

161
00:05:58,408 --> 00:05:59,776
I think you called off the air strike

162
00:05:59,843 --> 00:06:01,110
because Jonas Hodges is in possession

163
00:06:01,178 --> 00:06:02,278
of surface-to-surface missiles

164
00:06:02,345 --> 00:06:03,445
armed with the bioweapon,

165
00:06:03,513 --> 00:06:04,914
and he's threatening to use them

166
00:06:04,982 --> 00:06:07,784
in case you try to take action against him.

167
00:06:07,851 --> 00:06:09,718
Madam president,
Tony Almeida witnessed a truck

168
00:06:09,787 --> 00:06:12,855
pumping RP-7 rocket fuel
into an underground depot

169
00:06:12,923 --> 00:06:14,257
situated right next to the bunker

170
00:06:14,324 --> 00:06:16,092
where the bioweapons are being stored.

171
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,494
The only purpose for RP-7 rocket fuel

172
00:06:18,561 --> 00:06:19,929
is to launch missiles.

173
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:25,567
Madam president,
please just tell us the truth.

174
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:29,872
Jack, Hodges has 13 python missiles

175
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,640
armed with the bioweapons.

176
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:34,944
Three are currently aimed at american cities.

177
00:06:35,012 --> 00:06:36,745
He demanded that I recall the planes,

178
00:06:36,814 --> 00:06:37,746
or he would launch.

179
00:06:37,815 --> 00:06:38,881
What does Hodges want?

180
00:06:38,949 --> 00:06:40,082
I don't know ...

181
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,383
But he's requested a face-to-face meeting.

182
00:06:41,451 --> 00:06:43,452
He'll be at the white house in a few minutes.

183
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,921
Madam president, the only reason he wants

184
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:46,889
a face-to-face meeting is
to lay out his demands,

185
00:06:46,957 --> 00:06:48,991
and whatever they are,
you cannot negotiate with him.

186
00:06:49,059 --> 00:06:51,427
I'm not planning on negotiating
with him, Jack.

187
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:54,263
Once he places his cards on the table,

188
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:56,899
I am sure that I can ... I can make him realize

189
00:06:56,967 --> 00:06:59,368
the futility of what he is trying to do.

190
00:06:59,436 --> 00:07:01,971
Jonas Hodges is a traitor and a terrorist,

191
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:03,405
and after everything that's happened today,

192
00:07:03,473 --> 00:07:04,573
are you really naive enough

193
00:07:04,641 --> 00:07:06,442
to believe that you can simply talk to him

194
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:07,509
and change his mind?

195
00:07:07,577 --> 00:07:09,111
I'm not new at this, Jack,

196
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:11,113
and right now,
I don't have another option.

197
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:12,281
Madam president, you do.

198
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:13,782
Tony Almeida is still inside Starkwood.

199
00:07:13,851 --> 00:07:15,584
I ordered him exfiltrated immediately.

200
00:07:15,652 --> 00:07:16,785
What's he still doing there?

201
00:07:16,854 --> 00:07:19,688
I asked him to stand by
until I could talk to you.

202
00:07:19,756 --> 00:07:21,757
He believes he can
gain access to the fuel depot

203
00:07:21,825 --> 00:07:23,326
and lay a series of explosive charges

204
00:07:23,393 --> 00:07:24,927
and take the missiles out.

205
00:07:24,995 --> 00:07:27,396
Now, I believe this can work,
but we need to act quickly.

206
00:07:27,464 --> 00:07:28,764
What about the bioweapons?

207
00:07:28,832 --> 00:07:31,234
Rp-7 rocket fuel burns at 5.000 degrees.

208
00:07:31,301 --> 00:07:32,735
There will be nothing left.

209
00:07:32,802 --> 00:07:34,871
Once the weapons are destroyed,
Larry Moss and his teams

210
00:07:34,938 --> 00:07:37,139
can move in on Starkwood and lock it down.

211
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:39,508
Hodges gave standing orders to his men

212
00:07:39,576 --> 00:07:41,710
to launch the missiles at the first detection

213
00:07:41,778 --> 00:07:43,679
of government interference.

214
00:07:43,747 --> 00:07:45,114
If Almeida is detected,

215
00:07:45,182 --> 00:07:47,449
thousands of americans will die, Jack.

216
00:07:47,517 --> 00:07:49,151
Madam president, I know that there's a risk,

217
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:51,220
but I would not be asking you to do this

218
00:07:51,288 --> 00:07:53,389
if I didn't think it would work.

219
00:07:53,456 --> 00:07:55,624
Please, I am begging you.

220
00:07:55,692 --> 00:07:57,326
Trust me.

221
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:04,033
How long did the doctors

222
00:08:04,101 --> 00:08:05,667
give you to live?

223
00:08:08,438 --> 00:08:09,838
Uh, they're not sure,

224
00:08:09,907 --> 00:08:13,842
but the pathogen has started to take effect.

225
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:19,382
Then there's not much I can
threaten you with, is there?

226
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:24,253
I expect you'll do what you think is right.

227
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:35,631
What the hell does that mean?

228
00:08:35,698 --> 00:08:37,533
She wants us to go in.

229
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,102
But she didn't authorize it.

230
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:41,237
She can't.

231
00:08:41,305 --> 00:08:43,372
She needs this to be a covert operation.

232
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,773
If something were to go wrong

233
00:08:44,841 --> 00:08:46,342
and those missiles were to be launched,

234
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:47,910
The president needs to be able to swear

235
00:08:47,978 --> 00:08:49,111
under oath that we were working

236
00:08:49,179 --> 00:08:50,112
on our own.

237
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,347
She wants us to go in.

238
00:08:51,415 --> 00:08:53,816
Notify Larry.
We need to move fast.

239
00:08:58,255 --> 00:09:00,456
I told you I'd get you to the white house.

240
00:09:00,523 --> 00:09:02,624
I just didn't think it would be

241
00:09:02,692 --> 00:09:04,427
under these conditions.

242
00:09:06,997 --> 00:09:08,064
It was brilliant, you know.

243
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,367
What was that, sir?

244
00:09:11,435 --> 00:09:13,902
What you did to make Almeida think

245
00:09:13,971 --> 00:09:15,904
that you were betraying me.

246
00:09:15,973 --> 00:09:17,440
Quite brilliant.

247
00:09:17,507 --> 00:09:20,209
Thank you, sir.

248
00:09:20,277 --> 00:09:22,845
You put yourself in harm's way, Greg,

249
00:09:22,912 --> 00:09:24,947
and I'll never forget that.

250
00:09:27,951 --> 00:09:30,652
I can't believe ... I'm feeling nervous.

251
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,022
You're gonna do fine, sir.

252
00:09:34,358 --> 00:09:35,424
Thank you, Tim.

253
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:36,859
You're welcome.

254
00:09:38,362 --> 00:09:40,162
So, it sounds to me like the president

255
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:41,763
didn't actually authorize this.

256
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:42,965
Technically, no.

257
00:09:43,033 --> 00:09:45,201
It was more of an ... an indirect order,

258
00:09:45,268 --> 00:09:47,269
but believe me, Larry,
she wants this to happen.

259
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:48,937
She's gonna meet with Hodges,

260
00:09:49,006 --> 00:09:50,873
and we're gonna blow those fuel tanks.

261
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:53,109
Larry, do you have

262
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:54,843
a problem with this?

263
00:09:57,147 --> 00:09:58,780
As a matter of fact, no.

264
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:00,249
None whatsoever.

265
00:10:00,317 --> 00:10:02,584
These Starkwood bastards drew on my men.

266
00:10:02,652 --> 00:10:04,320
I'm looking forward to getting back in there.

267
00:10:04,388 --> 00:10:06,555
All right, have your teams hold their position

268
00:10:06,623 --> 00:10:07,623
and be ready to move.

269
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,125
Believe me, you'll know when it happens.

270
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:11,460
All right.

271
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:27,443
Tony,

272
00:10:27,511 --> 00:10:29,145
- It's Jack. Do you copy?
- Yeah, I'm here.

273
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:30,179
You were right about the missiles.

274
00:10:30,247 --> 00:10:31,213
The president confirmed it.

275
00:10:31,281 --> 00:10:32,248
We're gonna have to carry this out

276
00:10:32,315 --> 00:10:33,516
as a covert operation.

277
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:35,251
Larry and his men are standing by
to lock down Starkwood

278
00:10:35,318 --> 00:10:36,885
as soon as the missiles
have been destroyed.

279
00:10:36,953 --> 00:10:37,953
Good. Tony ...

280
00:10:38,021 --> 00:10:39,588
I need to know that you can do this

281
00:10:39,656 --> 00:10:40,789
without being detected.

282
00:10:40,857 --> 00:10:42,391
Hodges's given his men standing orders

283
00:10:42,459 --> 00:10:44,660
to launch those missiles
if there's a breach of any kind.

284
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:46,828
Yeah. I can do it.

285
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:48,697
Okay. Good luck.

286
00:10:48,765 --> 00:10:50,766
Yeah.

287
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:04,680
We're done here.

288
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:06,915
I'm going to go run a perimeter check.

289
00:11:06,983 --> 00:11:08,684
You said you just finished one.

290
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:10,119
I know.

291
00:11:10,187 --> 00:11:12,455
But I don't think we can be
too careful right now.

292
00:11:34,744 --> 00:11:36,712
- Yeah.
- It's me.

293
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,214
Auxiliary tanks are fueled and ready.

294
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:39,715
Confirmed.

295
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:41,417
I'll be down in a few minutes.

296
00:11:41,485 --> 00:11:42,485
Copy that.

297
00:11:45,755 --> 00:11:47,022
Freeze!

298
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:49,091
Let me see your hands.

299
00:11:51,761 --> 00:11:53,795
Almeida.

300
00:11:53,863 --> 00:11:56,132
Put your gun on the ground.

301
00:11:56,199 --> 00:11:58,200
Slowly.

302
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:04,406
Kick it.

303
00:12:08,512 --> 00:12:10,446
Drag him under the truck.

304
00:12:10,514 --> 00:12:11,614
Now! Let's go!

305
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:25,961
Hands up.

306
00:12:26,029 --> 00:12:27,729
What do you think you're doing?

307
00:12:27,797 --> 00:12:29,665
You're going to take me down
to the fuel tanks.

308
00:12:29,732 --> 00:12:31,733
Let's go.

309
00:12:33,637 --> 00:12:34,936
Ah-ah.

310
00:12:48,185 --> 00:12:50,186
Open it up.

311
00:12:56,059 --> 00:12:58,494
Go ahead.

312
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,200
The president will see you now.

313
00:13:27,489 --> 00:13:29,490
Very good. Thank you.

314
00:13:34,262 --> 00:13:36,529
Mr. Hodges.

315
00:13:36,597 --> 00:13:38,031
Madam president.

316
00:13:38,099 --> 00:13:39,333
This is Greg Seaton,

317
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:41,568
my associate.

318
00:13:41,636 --> 00:13:42,603
He's a remarkable man.

319
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:44,005
Doesn't look remarkable,

320
00:13:44,072 --> 00:13:45,373
but believe me, he's a genius.

321
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:49,309
Yes, I know Mr. Seaton.

322
00:13:50,878 --> 00:13:52,745
Thank you, gentlemen.

323
00:13:53,615 --> 00:13:56,116
It never gets old, does it?

324
00:13:57,185 --> 00:13:59,753
Stepping into the ... the oval office.

325
00:13:59,821 --> 00:14:00,788
Almost ...

326
00:14:00,855 --> 00:14:02,756
smells of history.

327
00:14:03,624 --> 00:14:04,591
Can we sit?

328
00:14:04,658 --> 00:14:06,626
Please.

329
00:14:06,694 --> 00:14:08,895
You know, this is the first time I've ...

330
00:14:08,963 --> 00:14:10,931
been in this room since you were elected?

331
00:14:10,998 --> 00:14:12,332
I'm aware of that, yes.

332
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:13,433
Under your predecessor,

333
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,870
I used to drop by every couple of months.

334
00:14:16,938 --> 00:14:19,039
I'd brief President Daniels

335
00:14:19,107 --> 00:14:22,209
on what was really going on in the world.

336
00:14:22,276 --> 00:14:24,711
And you've been excluded now.

337
00:14:24,779 --> 00:14:26,913
Is that what this is about?

338
00:14:26,981 --> 00:14:28,749
No, ma'am.

339
00:14:28,816 --> 00:14:32,200
It's about allowing Starkwood to fullfill
the purpose for which it was founded ...

340
00:14:32,253 --> 00:14:34,221
protecting this country.

341
00:14:34,288 --> 00:14:35,722
You have been attacking

342
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:36,757
this country.

343
00:14:36,824 --> 00:14:38,425
You and General Juma

344
00:14:38,492 --> 00:14:41,428
have killed hundreds of innocent people,

345
00:14:41,495 --> 00:14:43,496
including my son.

346
00:14:45,033 --> 00:14:47,968
Madam president,

347
00:14:48,036 --> 00:14:49,970
I'm deeply sorry for your loss,

348
00:14:50,038 --> 00:14:51,772
and my heart breaks

349
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:53,440
for all the lives that were taken today,

350
00:14:53,508 --> 00:14:54,608
but I'm shocked

351
00:14:54,676 --> 00:14:57,009
that you would think that I
had anything to do with this.

352
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:59,946
We have evidance that
you've been working with Juma.

353
00:15:00,514 --> 00:15:04,051
Your intelligence agencies have failed you.

354
00:15:04,118 --> 00:15:05,919
If I had known what Juma was up to,

355
00:15:05,987 --> 00:15:06,953
I would have done

356
00:15:07,021 --> 00:15:08,722
everything in my power to stop him.

357
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:12,125
So let's push aside all these
baseless accusations

358
00:15:12,193 --> 00:15:14,127
and maybe we can do some business here.

359
00:15:14,195 --> 00:15:16,196
I'm listening.

360
00:15:18,232 --> 00:15:20,167
Madam president,

361
00:15:20,234 --> 00:15:22,169
I know you're a student of history,

362
00:15:22,236 --> 00:15:23,636
and so you're well aware

363
00:15:23,705 --> 00:15:25,638
that our nation's independence was won

364
00:15:25,707 --> 00:15:26,873
with the aid of private armies,

365
00:15:26,941 --> 00:15:30,043
and we can't survive without them.

366
00:15:30,111 --> 00:15:32,412
Look how easy it was to get
bioweapons into this country.

367
00:15:32,479 --> 00:15:34,014
Our defenses are fragile.

368
00:15:34,082 --> 00:15:35,916
They're on the verge of collapse.

369
00:15:35,983 --> 00:15:38,985
But it's not too late to do something about it.

370
00:15:39,053 --> 00:15:41,188
So what are you suggesting?

371
00:15:41,255 --> 00:15:43,190
In short,

372
00:15:43,257 --> 00:15:45,158
I want a seat at the table.

373
00:15:45,226 --> 00:15:48,195
Starkwood needs to be involved in the shaping

374
00:15:48,262 --> 00:15:51,198
of military policy, domestic and global.

375
00:15:51,265 --> 00:15:53,366
It sounds more like

376
00:15:53,434 --> 00:15:55,535
you want a seat at the head of the table.

377
00:15:55,603 --> 00:15:58,705
Madam president,
I'm not here to supplant your authority.

378
00:15:58,773 --> 00:16:00,741
What I'm proposing is a partnership.

379
00:16:00,808 --> 00:16:02,576
Think of Starkwood

380
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,400
as the fifth branch of the military.

381
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:05,900
Greg?

382
00:16:08,983 --> 00:16:10,551
This contains the protocols

383
00:16:10,618 --> 00:16:12,619
that will serve as the basis of our agreement.

384
00:16:14,456 --> 00:16:16,389
I suggest that we review them together.

385
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:19,392
Jonas, I agreed to this meeting

386
00:16:19,461 --> 00:16:22,329
because I wanted to hear what you had to say.

387
00:16:22,396 --> 00:16:25,165
But what you're proposing is blackmail.

388
00:16:25,232 --> 00:16:28,101
Well, that's putting it in the worst possible light.

389
00:16:28,169 --> 00:16:31,638
You are threatening to kill thousands of people.

390
00:16:33,675 --> 00:16:36,977
I'm not proud of this chapter.

391
00:16:37,044 --> 00:16:39,746
I'm the first to admit it.

392
00:16:39,814 --> 00:16:40,981
And it's time to turn the page.

393
00:16:41,048 --> 00:16:42,983
This country has seen enough bloodshed today.

394
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:45,986
For the sake of the american people, madam president,

395
00:16:46,053 --> 00:16:48,455
I implore you to work with me,

396
00:16:48,523 --> 00:16:50,991
and let's move past this.

397
00:16:58,533 --> 00:17:01,201
Pick up the document, madam president.

398
00:17:24,726 --> 00:17:26,059
Let's go.

399
00:17:26,127 --> 00:17:28,194
Come on. Get up now, or I'll leave you down here.

400
00:17:28,262 --> 00:17:29,696
And you don't want that believe me. Get up!

401
00:17:29,764 --> 00:17:31,064
Let's go!

402
00:18:15,777 --> 00:18:16,877
Come on!

403
00:18:24,418 --> 00:18:25,953
What is it?

404
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:27,320
Code 363.

405
00:18:27,388 --> 00:18:28,354
That's a government breach.

406
00:18:28,422 --> 00:18:29,623
We're supposed to launch.

407
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:30,891
Are you sure it's not a false alarm?

408
00:18:30,959 --> 00:18:32,025
No way to tell.

409
00:18:32,093 --> 00:18:33,060
We've got standing

410
00:18:33,127 --> 00:18:34,227
orders, though.

411
00:18:34,295 --> 00:18:35,629
Let's start the launch sequence.

412
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:44,071
Too late.

413
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:56,650
Launch sequence complete.

414
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:58,284
Target is locked.

415
00:18:58,352 --> 00:18:59,653
Enter the firing codes.

416
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:01,054
Sir, we need to confirm this.

417
00:19:01,122 --> 00:19:02,990
That's not the correct protocol.

418
00:19:03,057 --> 00:19:04,491
We're about to kill 10.000 people.

419
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:06,493
We should get someone on the phone.

420
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,095
Enter the codes.

421
00:19:08,162 --> 00:19:09,129
Now!

422
00:19:09,196 --> 00:19:10,831
No, sir.

423
00:19:47,535 --> 00:19:49,469
That's it. That's us. Let's go.

424
00:19:49,537 --> 00:19:50,637
We're a go!

425
00:19:50,705 --> 00:19:52,539
We're a go!

426
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,200
It's done.

427
00:20:04,251 --> 00:20:05,552
Tony?

428
00:20:05,619 --> 00:20:07,788
Tony, do you copy?

429
00:20:07,855 --> 00:20:09,003
An explosion of that magnitude

430
00:20:09,004 --> 00:20:10,190
would have shortened his com.

431
00:20:10,257 --> 00:20:12,592
We're gonna have to wait for
Larry and his men to move in.

432
00:20:20,467 --> 00:20:22,202
It says here that you want

433
00:20:22,269 --> 00:20:25,072
active status in the pentagon's
strategic planning group.

434
00:20:25,139 --> 00:20:26,573
That's correct.

435
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,443
That would give you access to
level 6 classified material.

436
00:20:30,511 --> 00:20:32,245
Not even the vice president
has that clearance.

437
00:20:32,313 --> 00:20:35,816
These points are nonnegotiable.

438
00:20:35,883 --> 00:20:37,617
I'm not here to debate them.

439
00:20:37,685 --> 00:20:39,052
Let's review the next section,

440
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,780
which concerns senate oversight

441
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:42,388
of Starkwood field operations.

442
00:20:43,891 --> 00:20:45,826
I'm sorry to interrupt,
madam president, but I need

443
00:20:45,893 --> 00:20:46,827
to speak with you.

444
00:20:46,894 --> 00:20:47,961
Can it wait?

445
00:20:48,029 --> 00:20:49,930
No, ma'am, it can't.

446
00:20:49,997 --> 00:20:51,431
Will you excuse me for a moment?

447
00:20:51,498 --> 00:20:53,499
Of course.

448
00:21:04,311 --> 00:21:05,712
Satcom has just detected

449
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:07,748
a massive explosion on the
Starkwood compound.

450
00:21:07,815 --> 00:21:08,749
The bioweapons facility

451
00:21:08,816 --> 00:21:09,850
has been destroyed.

452
00:21:09,917 --> 00:21:11,017
- Are you sure?
- Yes, ma'am.

453
00:21:11,085 --> 00:21:12,352
Judging by the size of the explosion,

454
00:21:12,419 --> 00:21:13,386
Nothing could have survived.

455
00:21:13,454 --> 00:21:14,921
But I don't know how this happened.

456
00:21:14,989 --> 00:21:16,223
This wasn't us.

457
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:17,891
Call FBI and have them lock down Starkwood.

458
00:21:17,959 --> 00:21:20,060
- They're already moving in.
- Good.

459
00:21:20,128 --> 00:21:23,696
And when this is over,
I want to speak to Jack Bauer.

460
00:21:23,765 --> 00:21:24,798
Yes, ma'am.

461
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:27,167
You know ...

462
00:21:29,203 --> 00:21:30,937
I'm not sure I'm reaching her.

463
00:21:31,005 --> 00:21:32,105
I think you handled it

464
00:21:32,173 --> 00:21:33,740
perfectly, sir.

465
00:21:34,508 --> 00:21:37,176
We'll see.

466
00:21:39,213 --> 00:21:40,713
What the hell is this?

467
00:21:40,782 --> 00:21:43,449
Put this document into evidence,
and take these men

468
00:21:43,517 --> 00:21:44,818
into custody.

469
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:46,253
What are you thinking?
Have you lost

470
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,453
your mind?

471
00:21:47,521 --> 00:21:48,922
Jonas, we've taken out your missiles.

472
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:51,091
It's over.

473
00:21:52,493 --> 00:21:53,626
That's impossible.

474
00:21:53,694 --> 00:21:56,129
It's the truth.

475
00:21:56,197 --> 00:21:59,065
And you're under arrest.

476
00:21:59,133 --> 00:22:00,733
You are a terrorist and a murderer,

477
00:22:00,802 --> 00:22:03,436
and I'm gonna do everything
in my power to make sure

478
00:22:03,504 --> 00:22:05,672
that you pay dearly for your crimes.

479
00:22:07,308 --> 00:22:10,510
My only crime is that I'm trying to protect

480
00:22:10,577 --> 00:22:11,845
my country!

481
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:14,647
You think this ends with me?

482
00:22:14,715 --> 00:22:16,850
I'm just a small cog in a very big machine.

483
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:18,051
Hold on.

484
00:22:21,088 --> 00:22:23,489
You can't even begin to
imagine what you're up against.

485
00:22:24,057 --> 00:22:26,559
What are you talking about?

486
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:30,230
You'll find out.

487
00:22:34,068 --> 00:22:36,803
Get him out of here.

488
00:23:07,403 --> 00:23:08,403
The advanced biohazard team
is reporting

489
00:23:08,403 --> 00:23:09,900
no trace of the bioweapon anywhere

490
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:10,836
near the blast sight.

491
00:23:10,904 --> 00:23:12,105
It was incinerated in the explosion.

492
00:23:12,172 --> 00:23:13,272
Good.

493
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:14,640
- Any word on Tony?
- Not yet.

494
00:23:14,708 --> 00:23:15,808
Larry's searching the compound now.

495
00:23:15,875 --> 00:23:17,110
We should hear something soon.

496
00:23:17,177 --> 00:23:18,244
Mr. Bauer,

497
00:23:18,312 --> 00:23:20,346
you have a phone call.
It's the president.

498
00:23:20,414 --> 00:23:22,848
I'll take it in the conference room.
Thank you.

499
00:23:22,916 --> 00:23:24,383
I'll be right back.

500
00:23:35,895 --> 00:23:36,929
Madam president.

501
00:23:36,997 --> 00:23:38,998
Mr. Bauer, Jonas Hodges is

502
00:23:39,065 --> 00:23:41,134
under arrest.

503
00:23:41,201 --> 00:23:42,335
That's good news.

504
00:23:42,402 --> 00:23:43,603
That's very good.

505
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:48,340
Jack, you and your team
provided me with an option.

506
00:23:48,408 --> 00:23:51,243
And for that, I am deeply grateful.

507
00:23:51,311 --> 00:23:53,746
And so are the american people.

508
00:23:53,814 --> 00:23:56,181
Madam president, it was Tony Almeida

509
00:23:56,249 --> 00:23:58,751
who risked his life to destroy those missiles.

510
00:23:58,819 --> 00:24:00,085
And as you know, he's facing arrest

511
00:24:00,153 --> 00:24:01,654
for things he did leading up to today,

512
00:24:01,721 --> 00:24:03,322
and I was hoping that maybe

513
00:24:03,389 --> 00:24:05,825
you could ...

514
00:24:05,892 --> 00:24:07,726
Yes, Mr. Bauer?

515
00:24:12,499 --> 00:24:14,266
Jack?

516
00:24:16,302 --> 00:24:17,736
Um, I'm sorry, I ...

517
00:24:17,804 --> 00:24:20,372
completely forgot what I was saying.

518
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:23,208
You were talking about Mr. Almeida.

519
00:24:23,276 --> 00:24:24,693
And my answer is yes, I-I will

520
00:24:24,694 --> 00:24:26,111
take his action into account.

521
00:24:26,179 --> 00:24:29,114
Thank you.

522
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:32,952
What's happening?

523
00:24:33,019 --> 00:24:36,188
I-I-I'm not exactly sure.

524
00:24:36,255 --> 00:24:39,358
Jack, I am so sorry you're going through this.

525
00:24:39,425 --> 00:24:41,694
I wish that there were something I could do.

526
00:24:41,761 --> 00:24:44,597
M-madam president, I appreciate this phone call.

527
00:24:44,664 --> 00:24:47,366
But I'm sorry. I-I have to go.

528
00:24:47,433 --> 00:24:48,367
Of course.

529
00:24:48,434 --> 00:24:49,468
Thank you.

530
00:24:57,143 --> 00:24:58,076
Jonas Hodges

531
00:24:58,144 --> 00:24:59,144
has been arrested.

532
00:24:59,212 --> 00:25:00,145
Let me know

533
00:25:00,213 --> 00:25:01,547
as soon as you got Tony.

534
00:25:01,615 --> 00:25:03,315
I need to go see Dr. Macer.

535
00:25:05,351 --> 00:25:07,052
Yes, madam president?

536
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,488
Call Ben Landry at CDC.

537
00:25:09,556 --> 00:25:12,090
Tell him that I want real-time updates

538
00:25:12,158 --> 00:25:13,091
on Jack Bauer's condition.

539
00:25:13,159 --> 00:25:14,159
Yes, ma'am.

540
00:25:26,372 --> 00:25:28,607
We've secured all entry points
and command posts

541
00:25:28,675 --> 00:25:31,610
and are sweeping the compound
on a grid-by-grid basis.

542
00:25:31,678 --> 00:25:32,778
Are you meeting any resistance?

543
00:25:32,846 --> 00:25:34,413
No.

544
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,649
They're surrendering
peacefully and cooperating.

545
00:25:36,716 --> 00:25:38,817
Most of the men on this base,

546
00:25:38,885 --> 00:25:41,587
I don't think they had
any idea what was going on.

547
00:25:41,655 --> 00:25:43,255
What about Almeida?

548
00:25:43,322 --> 00:25:44,823
Uh, he's here.

549
00:25:44,891 --> 00:25:45,824
We found him.

550
00:25:45,892 --> 00:25:47,492
- Is he okay?
- Some cuts and bruises,

551
00:25:47,561 --> 00:25:49,361
but otherwise, he's in pretty good shape.

552
00:25:49,429 --> 00:25:50,563
Good. Good.

553
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:52,031
Jack will be glad to hear that.

554
00:25:52,098 --> 00:25:54,332
Listen, Renee ...

555
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:56,600
We've known each other a long time, you know.

556
00:25:56,610 --> 00:25:58,900
Um, so much stuff has happened today.

557
00:25:58,938 --> 00:26:00,172
Yeah.

558
00:26:00,239 --> 00:26:01,673
We have a lot to talk about.

559
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:02,576
I know.

560
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,543
Excuse me, Agent Walker.
Your visitor's arrived.
She's in the waiting area.

561
00:26:05,611 --> 00:26:07,100
Okay, thank you.

562
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:08,546
Larry, I've got to go.
Kim Bauer's here.

563
00:26:08,614 --> 00:26:09,614
Jack's daughter?

564
00:26:09,682 --> 00:26:11,316
Yes. I-I asked her to come.

565
00:26:11,384 --> 00:26:13,818
There's this experimental treatment

566
00:26:13,886 --> 00:26:15,820
for Jack's disease,
but he needs compatible stem cells.

567
00:26:15,888 --> 00:26:18,156
It's a long shot,
but it's the only hope he's got.

568
00:26:18,224 --> 00:26:20,459
Okay.

569
00:26:20,526 --> 00:26:22,127
Let me know how it goes, all right?

570
00:26:22,195 --> 00:26:23,862
I will.
I'm going off com.

571
00:26:23,929 --> 00:26:26,498
All right.

572
00:26:28,334 --> 00:26:29,767
Did they say something about Kim Bauer?

573
00:26:29,835 --> 00:26:32,604
Yeah, she's at FBI

574
00:26:32,671 --> 00:26:34,006
helping with a treatment for Jack,

575
00:26:34,073 --> 00:26:35,840
some, uh, some kind of stem cell therapy.

576
00:26:35,908 --> 00:26:38,143
So they think he's gonna be all right?

577
00:26:38,144 --> 00:26:40,512
Didn't sound promising.

578
00:26:43,182 --> 00:26:45,650
Listen, Tony, this isn't easy for me,

579
00:26:45,718 --> 00:26:48,586
But, uh ... I'm under orders

580
00:26:48,654 --> 00:26:49,954
to take you into federal custody.

581
00:26:50,023 --> 00:26:51,890
Yeah, I know.

582
00:26:51,957 --> 00:26:53,258
You did a brave thing here.

583
00:26:53,326 --> 00:26:55,460
Probably saved thousands of lives.

584
00:26:55,528 --> 00:26:57,429
For the record,

585
00:26:57,497 --> 00:26:59,597
I don't think this is how you should be repaid.

586
00:26:59,665 --> 00:27:01,866
I appreciate that, but, uh ...

587
00:27:03,869 --> 00:27:05,670
I'm ready to pay for what I've done.

588
00:27:05,738 --> 00:27:07,605
Get the cuffs off him, will you?

589
00:27:09,608 --> 00:27:10,708
Choppers on the way.

590
00:27:10,776 --> 00:27:12,810
I'll be taking you back to FBI, all right?

591
00:27:15,614 --> 00:27:18,550
Memory loss is consistent with the disease,

592
00:27:18,617 --> 00:27:19,551
Mr. Bauer.

593
00:27:19,618 --> 00:27:20,685
I just wouldn't have expected it

594
00:27:20,753 --> 00:27:22,620
to manifest this quickly.

595
00:27:22,688 --> 00:27:25,457
It's not just memory loss.

596
00:27:25,525 --> 00:27:27,526
It feels like ...

597
00:27:30,963 --> 00:27:33,532
I don't know exactly how to explain it.

598
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:35,833
I feel like, uh,

599
00:27:35,901 --> 00:27:38,203
like I'm losing some part of myself.

600
00:27:38,271 --> 00:27:40,238
The disease profile includes

601
00:27:40,306 --> 00:27:43,875
personality changes,
sometimes even hallucinations.

602
00:27:43,943 --> 00:27:45,677
But this is a weaponized pathogen

603
00:27:45,744 --> 00:27:46,911
We don't know much about.

604
00:27:46,979 --> 00:27:49,814
Military's still combing through the remains

605
00:27:49,882 --> 00:27:51,349
of the bioweapons lab in Sangala,

606
00:27:51,417 --> 00:27:53,051
so we expect to learn something

607
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:54,086
very soon.

608
00:27:54,153 --> 00:27:55,387
You were able to give me something

609
00:27:55,455 --> 00:27:56,921
that controlled the shaking.

610
00:27:58,291 --> 00:27:59,458
Is there anything that you can give me

611
00:27:59,525 --> 00:28:00,492
that would help me with this?

612
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,060
No.

613
00:28:02,128 --> 00:28:03,828
I'm sorry.

614
00:28:05,831 --> 00:28:07,532
Okay.

615
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,167
Thank you. Excuse me.

616
00:28:21,514 --> 00:28:24,949
Jack, is it all right?

617
00:28:25,017 --> 00:28:26,284
Yeah, um,

618
00:28:26,352 --> 00:28:28,587
I'm gonna need to go on record about everything

619
00:28:28,654 --> 00:28:29,588
that happened today.

620
00:28:29,655 --> 00:28:30,855
And we need to do it soon.

621
00:28:30,923 --> 00:28:32,690
I'm not sure how much longer I'm gonna be

622
00:28:32,758 --> 00:28:34,126
able to provide you with the details.

623
00:28:34,193 --> 00:28:35,793
Okay.

624
00:28:35,861 --> 00:28:37,596
First, there's something that you need to know.

625
00:28:37,663 --> 00:28:39,197
What?

626
00:28:39,265 --> 00:28:41,099
It's about Kim.

627
00:28:41,167 --> 00:28:42,601
She's here, Jack.

628
00:28:42,668 --> 00:28:44,102
I told her that you were sick

629
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:45,770
and that she might be able to help

630
00:28:45,838 --> 00:28:47,972
with the treatment.

631
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:50,041
You did ...

632
00:28:52,044 --> 00:28:53,978
You did what?

633
00:28:54,046 --> 00:28:54,979
Come here.

634
00:28:55,047 --> 00:28:57,048
Come here.

635
00:29:00,186 --> 00:29:01,486
Who the hell

636
00:29:01,554 --> 00:29:02,754
do you think you are?

637
00:29:02,821 --> 00:29:03,755
Who the hell

638
00:29:03,822 --> 00:29:05,490
do you think you are?

639
00:29:06,792 --> 00:29:08,993
You think this is easy?

640
00:29:09,061 --> 00:29:10,995
You think you understand what I'm going through?

641
00:29:11,063 --> 00:29:12,063
Because you don't.

642
00:29:12,131 --> 00:29:13,064
I am dying.

643
00:29:13,132 --> 00:29:15,500
And I was okay with it.

644
00:29:15,568 --> 00:29:18,102
I could handle it.

645
00:29:18,171 --> 00:29:21,206
And now you've put in front of me the one thing,

646
00:29:21,274 --> 00:29:23,775
the one thing that is gonna make this unbearable.

647
00:29:23,842 --> 00:29:25,743
- Jack, listen ...
- No, you listen to me.

648
00:29:25,811 --> 00:29:28,946
I specifically told you
do not drag my daughter into this.

649
00:29:29,014 --> 00:29:31,583
No one dragged her into anything.

650
00:29:31,651 --> 00:29:33,652
She's been trying to see you all day.

651
00:29:39,892 --> 00:29:41,025
What?

652
00:29:41,093 --> 00:29:44,329
She was at the senate hearing this morning.

653
00:29:44,397 --> 00:29:46,998
She flew out from L.A. to be there,

654
00:29:47,066 --> 00:29:49,000
but we pulled you out
before she could see you.

655
00:29:49,068 --> 00:29:50,935
She's been leaving messages
at our office all day.

656
00:29:51,003 --> 00:29:53,004
They just didn't get to me till now.

657
00:29:56,075 --> 00:29:59,143
If you want,
I can tell her that you're not here.

658
00:29:59,212 --> 00:30:02,214
I can tell her that you can't see her.

659
00:30:05,318 --> 00:30:07,686
I can't do that.

660
00:30:11,357 --> 00:30:13,124
Where is she?

661
00:30:13,192 --> 00:30:14,992
Down the hall.

662
00:30:16,329 --> 00:30:18,296
Show me.

663
00:30:50,759 --> 00:30:52,760
Daddy.

664
00:30:56,098 --> 00:30:58,432
How are you feeling?

665
00:30:59,467 --> 00:31:01,835
I'm-I'm okay.

666
00:31:01,904 --> 00:31:04,372
You're not in any pain?

667
00:31:04,439 --> 00:31:06,173
No.

668
00:31:07,642 --> 00:31:09,877
Come sit down.

669
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:27,261
Did Agent Walker tell you
that I was trying to find you?

670
00:31:27,329 --> 00:31:30,697
Yeah.

671
00:31:30,697 --> 00:31:32,750
I've tried everything to track you down:

672
00:31:32,768 --> 00:31:35,600
State department, private investigators.

673
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:37,605
Every time I got a phone number or an address,

674
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:39,307
you were already gone.

675
00:31:39,375 --> 00:31:41,009
I'm sorry.

676
00:31:41,077 --> 00:31:43,611
I thought I was doing
the best thing for you

677
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:45,080
by staying away.

678
00:31:47,917 --> 00:31:50,718
Daddy, I've missed you so much.

679
00:31:53,356 --> 00:31:57,359
I've missed you too.

680
00:31:59,627 --> 00:32:01,295
You need to know how sorry I am

681
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:03,900
for everything that you've had
to live through because of me.

682
00:32:03,932 --> 00:32:05,167
No, don't do that.

683
00:32:05,234 --> 00:32:06,468
Don't put that on yourself.

684
00:32:06,536 --> 00:32:08,036
I'm the one that should apologize.

685
00:32:08,104 --> 00:32:09,371
I pushed you away.

686
00:32:09,439 --> 00:32:11,273
And instead of taking responsibility

687
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:15,477
for all the mistakes I've made
in my life, I blamed you.

688
00:32:15,545 --> 00:32:17,845
And it was stupid

689
00:32:17,913 --> 00:32:19,914
and immature.

690
00:32:21,451 --> 00:32:24,752
And now, all the time that we've lost ...

691
00:32:28,891 --> 00:32:31,326
Agent Walker told me that there's a chance--

692
00:32:31,394 --> 00:32:34,696
A small chance-- that I could help you,

693
00:32:34,763 --> 00:32:36,398
And you don't want me to.

694
00:32:36,466 --> 00:32:38,832
The treatment is experimental.

695
00:32:38,968 --> 00:32:41,002
And I don't think it's going to work.

696
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:44,172
And you don't want to
because you're afraid to ask me.

697
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,241
No.

698
00:32:47,443 --> 00:32:49,377
There's a risk to you.

699
00:32:49,445 --> 00:32:51,913
A small risk ...

700
00:32:51,981 --> 00:32:53,848
worth taking.

701
00:32:53,916 --> 00:32:54,983
Not to me.

702
00:32:56,685 --> 00:32:59,821
Kim ... I'm dying.

703
00:33:01,056 --> 00:33:02,790
And whatever small chance there is

704
00:33:02,858 --> 00:33:04,959
to stop that from happening--

705
00:33:05,027 --> 00:33:09,264
it is not worth the pain for me to let you

706
00:33:09,332 --> 00:33:10,798
sit there and watch me die.

707
00:33:10,866 --> 00:33:13,268
Daddy, I don't want to lose you.

708
00:33:13,336 --> 00:33:15,437
Come here.

709
00:33:15,505 --> 00:33:16,804
Come on. I don't.

710
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,342
Sweetheart, it's going to be all right.

711
00:33:20,409 --> 00:33:22,977
It's gonna be all right.
I promise you.

712
00:33:28,618 --> 00:33:29,784
What is it?

713
00:33:31,854 --> 00:33:34,489
What?

714
00:33:36,825 --> 00:33:38,993
Sweetheart, I'm sorry ...

715
00:33:39,061 --> 00:33:42,264
But you need to go.

716
00:33:44,967 --> 00:33:46,768
Please baby, please,
I'm begging you.

717
00:33:47,803 --> 00:33:50,071
I love you so much.

718
00:33:50,139 --> 00:33:52,573
Honey, I love you too.
Please baby.

719
00:33:53,942 --> 00:33:55,943
Thank you. Go.

720
00:34:39,255 --> 00:34:42,290
Terminal 2 to dispatch:
Auxiliary gate 6 is clear.

721
00:34:42,358 --> 00:34:45,126
Copy that, P-2.
Hold your position.

722
00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:55,870
Freeze!

723
00:34:55,938 --> 00:34:57,138
Show me your hands.

724
00:34:57,206 --> 00:34:58,373
Get 'em up!

725
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
P-2 to dispatch.

726
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:12,954
I have an agent down
and a suspect in custody.

727
00:35:13,021 --> 00:35:14,122
Code red.

728
00:35:14,189 --> 00:35:15,590
Copy that, P-2.

729
00:35:15,658 --> 00:35:17,626
All available agents
respond to auxiliary gate 6.

730
00:35:17,693 --> 00:35:19,193
Code red.

731
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,601
Hands on the hood.

732
00:35:44,353 --> 00:35:47,389
P-2 to dispatch.

733
00:35:47,456 --> 00:35:49,758
Put me through to agent Moss.
It's urgent.

734
00:35:53,195 --> 00:35:54,862
Agent Moss.

735
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:57,299
Agent Moss, this is Davis
at auxiliary gate 6.

736
00:35:57,366 --> 00:35:59,133
I have a Starkwood op in custody.

737
00:35:59,201 --> 00:36:00,702
He killed one of our agents.

738
00:36:00,770 --> 00:36:02,470
He was carrying a canister of the bioweapon,

739
00:36:02,538 --> 00:36:03,571
trying to smuggle it out

740
00:36:03,639 --> 00:36:04,739
using one of our vehicles.

741
00:36:04,807 --> 00:36:06,641
What?!
Are you sure?

742
00:36:06,709 --> 00:36:08,576
I'm looking at it right now.

743
00:36:11,447 --> 00:36:14,248
Agent Davis?

744
00:36:14,317 --> 00:36:16,117
Davis?!

745
00:36:21,357 --> 00:36:23,057
Walker.

746
00:36:23,125 --> 00:36:25,360
Renee, we got a breach
in the cordon at gate 6.

747
00:36:25,428 --> 00:36:26,528
One of the Starkwood ops--

748
00:36:26,595 --> 00:36:27,995
He's got a canister of the bioweapon.

749
00:36:28,063 --> 00:36:29,163
What?

750
00:36:29,231 --> 00:36:30,498
It was ID'd by Agent Davis,

751
00:36:30,566 --> 00:36:32,066
who I believe has just been shot.

752
00:36:32,134 --> 00:36:34,068
The suspect may be fleeing in an FBI vehicle,

753
00:36:34,136 --> 00:36:36,304
so I need you to close down
all access roads,

754
00:36:36,372 --> 00:36:37,905
and alert perimeter units
and metro police.

755
00:36:37,973 --> 00:36:39,173
Janis, get me DC metro.

756
00:36:39,241 --> 00:36:40,675
I'm gonna pursue it from the air.

757
00:36:40,743 --> 00:36:42,844
Let's go! Let us up!

758
00:36:44,447 --> 00:36:45,747
Renee,

759
00:36:45,815 --> 00:36:47,649
alert Homeland,
let them know what's going on.

760
00:36:47,717 --> 00:36:49,584
Are we thinking this is
another attack, Larry?

761
00:36:49,652 --> 00:36:51,453
I don't know,
but there's enough prion variant

762
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:54,121
in one of those canisters
to take out a small city.

763
00:37:18,344 --> 00:37:20,279
Agent Miller,
are there any major roadways

764
00:37:20,346 --> 00:37:22,648
in our perimeter that Starkwood
operatives could have used?

765
00:37:22,716 --> 00:37:23,816
Yes, sir.

766
00:37:23,884 --> 00:37:25,117
We're coming up on highway 42.

767
00:37:25,184 --> 00:37:26,452
Should I turn us that way?

768
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,970
Yeah, let's head that way,

769
00:37:27,987 --> 00:37:29,555
until we hear something from Agent Walker.

770
00:37:29,623 --> 00:37:31,524
Roger that.

771
00:37:31,591 --> 00:37:33,826
Yes, sir.
We'll keep Homeland apprised

772
00:37:33,894 --> 00:37:35,528
with real-time updates.

773
00:37:35,595 --> 00:37:37,762
Did you access the GPS locator system?

774
00:37:37,771 --> 00:37:39,364
Yeah, I'm scanning

775
00:37:39,433 --> 00:37:41,500
transponders for the stolen FBI vehicle.

776
00:37:41,568 --> 00:37:42,701
How long will that take?

777
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:44,670
As long as it takes for the satellite to reposition.

778
00:37:44,738 --> 00:37:47,706
When you spoke to Larry, you mentioned

779
00:37:47,774 --> 00:37:49,041
an attack?

780
00:37:49,108 --> 00:37:50,342
The Starkwood operative

781
00:37:50,410 --> 00:37:52,177
we're trying to find stole a canister

782
00:37:52,245 --> 00:37:53,746
of the bioweapon.

783
00:37:53,814 --> 00:37:55,848
I thought Tony Almeida
destroyed all the weapons.

784
00:37:55,916 --> 00:37:57,015
Apparently not.

785
00:37:57,083 --> 00:37:58,984
How did this operative
get past our perimeter?

786
00:37:59,052 --> 00:38:01,554
Shot and killed two of our agents.

787
00:38:01,621 --> 00:38:03,956
This is it.

788
00:38:04,023 --> 00:38:07,493
The suspect is getting off highway 42
at Smoketree Avenue.

789
00:38:07,494 --> 00:38:09,480
He's heading towards the industrial corridor.

790
00:38:09,496 --> 00:38:11,229
Put me on the interagency channel.

791
00:38:11,297 --> 00:38:12,932
Go ahead. All units, this is

792
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:14,132
Agent Walker with FBI.

793
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:17,169
Suspect has exited highway 42 at Smoketree.

794
00:38:17,236 --> 00:38:18,771
He's heading north into the industrial corridor.

795
00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:20,339
Units in the vicinity, please respond.

796
00:38:20,406 --> 00:38:21,507
Renee, it's me.

797
00:38:21,575 --> 00:38:22,842
We're over Smoketree right now.

798
00:38:22,909 --> 00:38:24,610
We're redirecting,
and we'll tighten our pursuit.

799
00:38:24,678 --> 00:38:27,212
Got it.
I'll reroute SWAT team alpha to the scene.

800
00:38:28,482 --> 00:38:29,682
Swat team alpha, we need

801
00:38:29,749 --> 00:38:30,716
to set up a roadblock

802
00:38:30,784 --> 00:38:32,184
at the fairfax county line.

803
00:38:32,251 --> 00:38:34,000
Dc metro's covering the district line
in case he tries

804
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:35,254
to double back.

805
00:38:35,255 --> 00:38:36,755
Copy that, at county line.

806
00:38:41,828 --> 00:38:43,362
Sir.

807
00:38:43,429 --> 00:38:45,430
I have a visual.

808
00:38:45,499 --> 00:38:47,666
Yeah. Got him.

809
00:38:53,974 --> 00:38:55,741
Get us lower.

810
00:39:02,883 --> 00:39:04,750
Yeah, he's pulling off the road.
Get us down there now.

811
00:39:08,989 --> 00:39:10,155
Renee, it's Larry.
Suspect is on foot.

812
00:39:10,223 --> 00:39:11,490
We can't wait for backup.

813
00:39:11,558 --> 00:39:12,791
We're moving in right now.

814
00:39:12,859 --> 00:39:14,627
All right.
SWAT team's a few minutes out.

815
00:39:14,694 --> 00:39:16,595
Careful, Larry.
Yeah.

816
00:39:16,663 --> 00:39:19,832
Remember, suspect has a canister,

817
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,000
so pick your shots.

818
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:22,434
If possible, let's take him alive.

819
00:39:22,502 --> 00:39:23,702
Yes, sir.

820
00:39:30,376 --> 00:39:31,977
We got to get out of here.

821
00:39:32,045 --> 00:39:33,345
Almeida, cover.
Let's go.

822
00:39:33,413 --> 00:39:35,414
Come on!

823
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:05,611
Sir, relax.

824
00:40:05,679 --> 00:40:07,379
Relax.

825
00:40:07,447 --> 00:40:08,814
I'm okay. Relax.

826
00:40:13,453 --> 00:40:15,153
Swallow. Tony.

827
00:40:16,422 --> 00:40:17,556
Tony!

828
00:40:17,624 --> 00:40:20,225
Tony!

829
00:40:26,633 --> 00:40:29,468
What...?

830
00:40:29,535 --> 00:40:32,370
I'm sorry, Larry.

831
00:40:32,438 --> 00:40:34,573
Oh ... god ...

832
00:40:34,641 --> 00:40:36,208
Oh!

833
00:41:24,257 --> 00:41:26,091
Let me see it.

834
00:41:48,548 --> 00:41:50,849
How the hell do we get out of here?

835
00:41:50,917 --> 00:41:53,786
I want you to take this.
Find a place to hide.

836
00:41:53,853 --> 00:41:55,587
Wait for my call.
What about you?

837
00:41:55,655 --> 00:41:57,022
I'm gonna wait on the FBI,

838
00:41:57,090 --> 00:41:59,391
Figure out a way to get you out of here.

839
00:41:59,458 --> 00:42:00,625
Go!

840
00:42:03,626 --> 00:42:08,626
