1
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:18,560
Right now, terrorists are plotting
to assassinate a presidential candidate.

2
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,120
My wife and daughter have been targeted.

3
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:25,280
And people that I work with
may be involved in both.

4
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:30,920
I'm Federal Agent Jack Bauer,
and today is the longest day of my life.

5
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:38,200
You must talk to Victor Drazen when he calls.
Listen to his demands and cooperate.

6
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,520
Senator, please answer this phone.

7
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,400
- This is David Palmer.
- Hello, Senator Palmer.

8
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,480
Senator!

9
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,160
We did it, Father. We did it.

10
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,800
The man that planned the explosion
needs to believe it was a success.

11
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,280
You want the world
to think that David is dead?

12
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,600
- Yes, ma'am.
- Absolutely not.

13
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:04,480
- David, what's this all about?
- His daughter is being held hostage.

14
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,880
I'll take care of the girl. Then we can leave.

15
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,840
Do not do anything until we know
Jack Bauer is dead as well. Nothing.

16
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,960
I was calling to confirm your death,
but I see you've survived.

17
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,040
I have an offer to make you.

18
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:20,560
You've already killed Senator Palmer.
I'm the last person on your list.

19
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,640
- I'll make you a trade. Me for my daughter.
- Come to Port of Los Angeles. Dock 11A.

20
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,640
Do you mind if I have some coffee?

21
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,440
Stop right there, Kim! Don't move.

22
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,080
Maybe you're right. Maybe she drowned.

23
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:17,720
It does not matter, as long as
Bauer believes his daughter is here.

24
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,680
Stop! Stop, please!

25
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,440
At this time, we do not have any information

26
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:03,640
as to the cause of the explosion
that killed Senator David Palmer.

27
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,560
Do you have any idea
what's going on out there?

28
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,840
Since no one has seen a body,
the media's circulating all kinds of rumours.

29
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:18,080
Look, I will tell them as soon as I have
confirmation that Bauer's daughter is safe.

30
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,800
And then what, David?
You're gonna play dead?

31
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,080
And I'm supposed to hide in here
and play the grieving widow?

32
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,000
Just how long do you think
we can keep that charade up?

33
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:30,400
- For as long as we have to.
- Well, that's crazy! It's...

34
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:33,040
Mike, tell him how crazy it is.
He listens to you.

35
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,640
- Don't put me in the middle of it.
- Isn't that your job? To be in the middle?

36
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,360
For crying out loud, Mike.
It's your career on the line too.

37
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:46,680
OK. You came clean on TV today.
You got lucky.

38
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,680
But it could just as easily
have gone the other way.

39
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:54,240
Testing the public's patience like that?
You won't be lucky again, David.

40
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,320
Listen to me.

41
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,480
Jack Bauer saved my life today.

42
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,280
- Not once, but twice.
- Yes, I realise that.

43
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,520
- And I am sympathetic to what he's going...
- I don't think you are.

44
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,400
- David, I am. Listen to me.
- No. I am going to respect his request.

45
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,840
And so are you.
You will not sacrifice his daughter.

46
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,280
Anything new?

47
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:39,200
- I'm going over the intel from Langley.
- I mean about Jack.

48
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,320
- CTU, Almeida.
- I assume you still haven't heard from him?

49
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,080
- You sure?
- No. Not yet.

50
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,600
George? I got Highway Patrol on line seven.
They picked up a girl at Port of Los Angeles.

51
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,480
- Says she's Jack's daughter.
- Patch it through.

52
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,640
- This is Mason, CTU. Who am I speaking to?
- Sergeant Devlin, Highway Patrol.

53
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:03,480
- You have a young woman with you?
- She claims to be the daughter of an agent.

54
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,560
- Jack Bauer?
- That's right.

55
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,680
Can I speak with her, please?

56
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,800
- Hello?
- Kim, this is George Mason at CTU.

57
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,920
- How are you? OK?
- Yeah. You gotta tell my father I've escaped.

58
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
- He'll go back there and they'll kill him.
- Can you tell us where these people are?

59
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,280
The port. I... I don't know exactly.

60
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,040
- May I speak with the sergeant again?
- OK.

61
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,680
- Yeah. We picked her up near Dock 11 Alpha.
- Send two tactical teams, highest priority.

62
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,000
Have law enforcement
establish a perimeter.

63
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,720
- Where are you now?
- Just north of the harbour.

64
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,800
All right. Get Kim over here ASAP, all right?

65
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,320
We gotta find Jack
before he walks into a trap.

66
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,000
We need to coordinate two...

67
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,840
- Yeah?
- What's taking so long?

68
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:54,040
- I just got here.
- Where exactly?

69
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,880
Don't worry, I'm close enough.
Where's my daughter?

70
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,640
- Right here.
- Put her on the phone.

71
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:03,760
Come to the parking lot of the freight office.
I'll come out with her.

72
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,840
- Let me speak to her first.
- There's been enough talking.

73
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,520
After what's happened,
you expect me to trust you?

74
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:13,640
You lied to us about Palmer being dead,
so don't talk to me about trust, all right?

75
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:17,400
Get down here now
or I'll kill her myself. Trust that.

76
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:21,120
I'm not gonna show myself
until I speak to my daughter first.

77
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,960
Don't test me. Bauer!

78
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:32,600
- He's not coming.
- He's coming.

79
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,800
Nina, what's the ETA on the tac teams?

80
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,760
Five on the alpha, eight on the beta.

81
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,640
It doesn't matter. Stay on it.

82
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,400
- Myers.
- Nina, it's me.

83
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,000
- Where are you?
- Listen carefully.

84
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,600
I've just confirmed that someone at CTU
is feeding the Drazens information.

85
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,680
- Based on what?
- They know Palmer wasn't killed in the blast.

86
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,440
Who at CTU had clearance
for that kind of intel?

87
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:11,200
- Besides me, just Tony, Mason and Chapelle.
- One of those three is working for them.

88
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,840
You need to find out which one.

89
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,320
Jack, what are you doing? Where are you?

90
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,120
Andre agreed to a trade. Me for Kim.

91
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:24,920
- Are you gonna just walk right up to them?
- If I can guarantee Kim's safety, yes.

92
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,240
Nina, there's a chance
I won't be able to see this thing through.

93
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:33,960
Until you find out who's giving the Drazens
information, don't trust anyone. I gotta go.

94
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,960
I don't think the situation
will require much spin,

95
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,280
as long as you do
what you've been doing all along.

96
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:00,400
- Tell me again what I've been doing, Mike.
- Telling the truth.

97
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,360
Oh, yeah.

98
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:07,680
And tearing my family apart in the process.

99
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,160
As hard as it's been for everyone,

100
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,480
I think this last day has been about
finding out who you really are.

101
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,360
And not just as a candidate.

102
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,040
- Yeah?
- Mike, turn on the television.

103
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,400
What is it, Mike?

104
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,040
A reliable source from inside
Senator Palmer's campaign

105
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,760
confirmed just moments ago
that the senator was indeed unharmed

106
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,600
- by the blast reported here over an hour ago.
- Dammit!

107
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,680
What is still uncertain is why
the senator has not made a statement

108
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,920
- and how the rumour of his death...
- Sherry.

109
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,440
David. We have to deal with the press. David!

110
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,160
David!

111
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,760
- You couldn't wait to leak it to the press.
- David, I...

112
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:02,440
- It was you. What were you thinking?
- They already knew.

113
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,760
Dammit, Sherry!
The way you keep defying me!

114
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:08,560
- I'm not defying you! I am protecting you!
- Protecting me from what?

115
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,000
- Mike!
- Back off, David. I mean it.

116
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,520
- Get off me!
- I mean it!

117
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,320
- Get off me!
- Back off!

118
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,880
David, you have to talk to the press now.

119
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,040
The longer you take to make a statement,
the more control you give up.

120
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,720
- Come on.
- Dammit, if that child dies...

121
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,120
- Yes?
- It's me.

122
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,280
- What is it?
- They found his daughter.

123
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,360
She'll be here within the hour.

124
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,920
- Does Bauer know?
- No. Not yet.

125
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,440
I'm the only one who's in contact with him.
I've been ordered to send in two teams.

126
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:15,000
- They're on their way.
- Right. Hold on.

127
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:19,280
They found the girl. Bauer doesn't know,
but the CTU people are on their way.

128
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,880
We have to get you out of here.

129
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:25,760
He won't come if we can't produce the girl.
He's not stupid.

130
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,240
We just have time
to get to international waters.

131
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,280
I can't risk you getting captured again.

132
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,400
Give me the phone.

133
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,440
Can you contact Bauer?

134
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,600
Yes.

135
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:46,400
Tell him his daughter's dead.
Her body was found floating in the harbour.

136
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,440
- You think he'll come after you?
- Yes.

137
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,720
You'll have to kill him. No mistakes.

138
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,520
If he finds out I've lied to him,
my cover will be blown.

139
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,600
Of course we will kill him. That is the point.

140
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,200
He is coming.

141
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,960
Andre?

142
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:11,040
No. It's me.
I think you should come back to CTU.

143
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,720
I can't. I'm running out of time.
I'm going in to get Kim now.

144
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,680
- I don't know how to tell you this, Jack.
- What is it, Nina?

145
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,840
Nina, what is it?

146
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:24,400
A coastguard cutter answered
the APB we put out on Kim.

147
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,480
- They found her body, Jack.
- What?

148
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,120
I'm sorry. She's dead.

149
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,840
- No.
- Jack, I'm so sorry. I know... Jack?

150
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,280
Jack?

151
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,520
What if Bauer doesn't come? He may be too
crushed by the thought his daughter is dead.

152
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,040
That is exactly why he will come.

153
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,600
Believe me. I know.

154
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:51,080
Go! Go! Hurry, Father. Get to the boat.

155
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,720
Agh!

156
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:24,520
It has come to my attention that
some misinformation was given to the press.

157
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:29,200
And, again, I apologise
for the misunderstanding.

158
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,720
As you can imagine,
this has been a very chaotic situation.

159
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:38,640
But I appreciate the confidence the voters
have continued to show for our campaign.

160
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,640
We regret that false information has
been broadcast regarding this incident.

161
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,400
But, thankfully, no one was hurt.

162
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,600
My family and I are safe,
and we have no intention

163
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:51,520
of letting this slow us down in any way.

164
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,840
- Did you come in here to lecture me, Mike?
- Lecture you on what?

165
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:02,320
About how I'm not being
supportive enough of David.

166
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,360
Actually, I'm on your side this time.

167
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:10,240
I think David was hurting himself
with this charade.

168
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:14,560
Maybe it's good
you leaked the truth to the press.

169
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:22,240
I wanna know what this entire day
has done to his campaign.

170
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,280
I think we should run some focus groups
first thing in the morning.

171
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,680
I've already called Robin over at ASI.

172
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:33,840
OK. Good. Do you think David should cancel
his trip to Dallas, go back to Washington?

173
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,920
I don't know, Sherry.

174
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:40,640
I think... David should make that call.

175
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,760
Oh, no. I don't. David's in no frame of mind
to make critical decisions right now.

176
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:48,280
It's gonna take you and I
to steer this thing by ourselves, OK?

177
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:51,360
Until he gets his head screwed on right.

178
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,400
Listen, Sherry.

179
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,800
David wanted to meet you privately
when he finished his statement.

180
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:02,200
David doesn't need to make an appointment
to see me, Mike. I'm right here.

181
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,800
He'll be in the ballroom in five minutes.

182
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,240
I've already called the Secret Service.

183
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,640
What... what's this all about?

184
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:14,760
He didn't say. If I were you...

185
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:20,480
I'd take it as an opportunity
to make the first move...

186
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:25,640
to patch things up, make things right, Sherry.

187
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,400
Fine, Mike.

188
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,560
It's too much. Tony, get this.

189
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,400
I'll call you back.
Tac team gets there. Jack didn't wait.

190
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,400
- He went in without 'em.
- By himself?

191
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,760
- Evidently.
- Is he all right?

192
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:53,560
- He's alive.
- What about the Drazens?

193
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,040
- What are you talking about?
- Dead.

194
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:01,560
Congratulations, Teri. Your family's fine.
They're on their way here.

195
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:06,000
Anyway, Karris counts seven down.
Jack's the last man standing.

196
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,880
- Contact Secret Service. I'll update Division.
- I talked to Jack an hour ago.

197
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,680
- He said he was on his way to get Kim.
- Everybody's fine.

198
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:15,080
Now go in there and celebrate. Relax.

199
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,080
Nina?

200
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,600
Can I help you?

201
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,520
Ja?

202
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,800
- Just call me when it's time.
- Someone is there?

203
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,000
- Yes.
- I understand.

204
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,600
- You speak German?
- Frankfurt Division.

205
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,720
- Something wrong?
- Yeah.

206
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:04,000
I heard there was some big shoot-out.
I can't get anyone to tell me what's going on.

207
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:08,640
Teri, calm down. Jack and Kim are fine.
They're on their way here right now.

208
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,520
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

209
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,160
- And the men that were after Kim and me?
- They're dead.

210
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,280
You and Kim are completely safe.

211
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,600
- And so is Jack.
- OK.

212
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:21,920
I just want us all to be back together again.

213
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
It won't be long.

214
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:27,080
Thank God.

215
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,160
- This is Myers.
- You're still not alone?

216
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,800
- That's right.
- Listen carefully.

217
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,040
Procedures are in place.
Collect all of your information.

218
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,680
- We have arranged for your extraction.
- Where?

219
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:43,600
The usual pick-up point. Northwest corner.

220
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,000
- Is there anything else?
- No. I know you're busy.

221
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:49,160
I'm gonna let you get back to work.

222
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,400
I can't let you go.

223
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,600
Not yet.

224
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,680
Move back into the room. Slowly.

225
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,360
I said move!

226
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:16,320
Against the wall.

227
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,600
On your knees. Do it!

228
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,720
Officer!

229
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,320
The body that you guys pulled out
of the harbour. It was my daughter.

230
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,120
- I'd like to claim the body.
- Not sure what you're referring to.

231
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:45,400
The coastguard.
They pulled a body out of the harbour.

232
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:48,440
- In the last hour?
- I didn't hear anything. I just got on duty.

233
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:52,280
- If you'd like, I can call the harbour master.
- Hold on one second.

234
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,560
Give me your phone.

235
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,320
- Could you call him now, please?
- Yeah, sure.

236
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,800
- Harbour master's office.
- Hey, Frank.

237
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:06,080
Did you pull a body
out of the harbour tonight?

238
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,880
- Uh, no. Nothing on our patrol.
- Are you sure?

239
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,200
- No reports anywhere.
- All right. Roger that.

240
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:15,160
- What did he say?
- No body was found in the harbour or near it.

241
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,440
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

242
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,640
Is it possible another unit picked her up?

243
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:23,680
We cover 50 miles of coastline.
There was no body found tonight.

244
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,840
Thanks. Thank you.

245
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,480
- This is Mason.
- Hey, it's Jack.

246
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:01,440
Shall I congratulate you
or demand your resignation?

247
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,600
- Do you know where my daughter is?
- As a matter of fact I do.

248
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:08,000
Highway Patrol picked her up
half an hour ago. She's heading here now.

249
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:12,360
- If you'd called, I could have told you.
- You need to arrest Nina.

250
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,240
- What?
- She's working against us.

251
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:18,040
- Don't let her out of the building.
- Jack, hold on. What's all this about?

252
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,640
She told me that
the coastguard found Kim's body.

253
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,600
I confirmed with them
they never found a body tonight.

254
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:26,160
She was working with the Drazens
to set a trap for me.

255
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,360
Are you sure it wasn't a misunderstanding?

256
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:31,760
About Kim being dead? No, she lied.
There was no misunderstanding.

257
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,280
It doesn't sound like there's any proof either.

258
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:38,600
I'll get you your proof.
Just don't let her out of your sight.

259
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:57,440
- Archives. Wilson.
- Hey, Paul. It's Jack.

260
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:02,040
I need a copy of the security tape from this
morning, between 8.50 and 9am in the ITS,

261
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,920
when Jamey committed suicide in there.

262
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,640
All right. Let me check.

263
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,840
- That's weird.
- What, you got it?

264
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:17,840
- Yes, sir. Except the tape was erased.
- When?

265
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,120
- This morning.
- The digital backup?

266
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:24,400
- There's no digital backup system for ITS.
- There is. You need the clearance code.

267
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,760
Try C22717.

268
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,480
- How long is this gonna take?
- Just a few minutes.

269
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:34,240
OK. Get back to me as soon as you can.

270
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,800
Wait a moment, please.

271
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,600
David?

272
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,000
Mike said you wanted to see me.

273
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:11,080
Yes.

274
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,040
I know we need to talk, but...

275
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:22,480
Honestly, David, we haven't slept in two days.
Can't it wait till the morning?

276
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,240
We've had a rough day.

277
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,760
And, yes, I know that
you are very angry with me.

278
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,800
But when we've put this day in perspective,

279
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:57,320
you'll realise that I've been acting
in your best interest all along.

280
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:01,600
- I'm not angry with you, Sherry.
- Oh, good, David.

281
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,240
I feel sorry for you.

282
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,000
You feel sorry for me?

283
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,880
You've lost touch with what it is to be...

284
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,040
a parent.

285
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,480
A friend.

286
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,200
A wife.

287
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,160
What?

288
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,040
After tonight...

289
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,320
I don't wanna see you again.

290
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:52,720
- David, will you just...
- Sherry, please. I've heard it all before.

291
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:00,440
And I don't care
what this may do to my candidacy.

292
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:04,440
And it's not because
I don't wanna be president. I do.

293
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:12,440
I just don't think you're fit to be the first lady.

294
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:26,960
Do you really think
that you can just leave me?

295
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:34,840
Don't believe for a second
that it's gonna be that easy.

296
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:39,400
Secret Service will take you back
to Washington whenever you're ready.

297
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,840
David.

298
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:49,000
David, you just don't walk away from me!

299
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,880
David, you can't do this without me!

300
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,600
David, I'm talking to you!

301
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:01,600
- Sorry, ma'am.
- Get your hands off of me.

302
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,680
Yeah?

303
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:40,200
It's Wilson. I got the Jamey Farrell
interrogation footage for you.

304
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:43,600
Good. I've got a monitor in my car.
Upload it and send it to me.

305
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,680
Yeah, sure thing.

306
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,840
Oh, my God!

307
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:07,440
Send this over to Mason. His eyes only.
Then patch me through to him.

308
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,360
Mason.

309
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,840
I'm sending something.
Are you by your screen?

310
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:15,280
- Yeah. What is it?
- Proof against Nina. She killed Jamey.

311
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,520
- What? Why...
- Can you see it?

312
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,600
Uh... yeah.

313
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,800
Oh.

314
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:28,440
This is unbelievable.
Where are you right now?

315
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:31,200
- I'm about five minutes out.
- OK.

316
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,800
Find her, George.

317
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,040
- Where are you?
- I'm leaving now.

318
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:04,400
You have 16 minutes
to reach the pick-up point.

319
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,920
We're routing you through
Munich for three days.

320
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,240
Why Germany?
Why can't I come to you directly?

321
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:12,240
I don't know. These are the instructions.

322
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,720
You'll need to be untraceable
during that time.

323
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:17,640
Make sure nothing
can connect you to Germany.

324
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,880
- Did you hear me?
- Yeah. All right.

325
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:27,440
I'm leaving now, Teri.

326
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:30,360
I'm gonna lock you in from the outside.

327
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,960
Someone will find you soon.

328
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:36,080
Everything will be fine.

329
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,280
- Anything?
- Nothing.

330
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,360
Miss Myers!

331
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,160
Yeah...

332
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,680
Put your hands where I can see them!

333
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:24,400
Nina, put your hands on the steering wheel!

334
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,680
Jack.

335
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:48,000
If you kill me, you won't know who I work for.

336
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:51,680
You think I work for Drazen, but I don't.

337
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,720
I trusted you.

338
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,080
- I was just doing my job.
- Your job?

339
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:03,320
My wife and daughter almost died today.

340
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:08,040
How many people that trusted you lost their
life today because you were doing your job?

341
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:10,920
Walsh. Jamey. Ellis.

342
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,760
- How many others?
- How many died because of you, Jack?

343
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:18,480
Jack, take it easy. We need her alive.

344
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,200
Come on, Jack. Kim just got here.

345
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,440
They're taking her inside right now. Come on.

346
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:27,200
Jack, don't do it.

347
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:34,160
Come on, Jack. Come and be
with your family. Come on. Let's go.

348
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,920
Let's go inside.
This is no good. Come on, Jack.

349
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,360
Good, Jack. Come on.

350
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:57,160
Come on. It's OK.

351
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,400
You all right?

352
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,960
You did the right thing.

353
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:07,000
You wanna take her up?

354
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,720
Come on.

355
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,280
All right. Let's go.

356
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,320
- Sweetheart!
- Dad!

357
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:40,240
- Thank God you're all right. Aah!
- Oh, I'm sorry.

358
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,000
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, baby. I'm all right. How about you?

359
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,880
- I'm fine.
- Are you sure?

360
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:48,600
- I'm positive. Oh, I was so worried.
- Oh, sweetheart.

361
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:54,120
It's all over, baby.
No one's gonna hurt you now, I promise.

362
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,160
- I love you so much.
- I love you.

363
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:04,880
- Where's Mom?
- I... I thought she was here with you.

364
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:08,000
I'll go find her.
Just stay here with the guards, OK?

365
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:10,080
- OK.
- OK.

366
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:14,920
...two assassination attempts
just hours apart.

367
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,040
It may take days, even weeks,
before the details become clear,

368
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:22,320
but sources close to the CIA
cite Special Agent Jack Bauer

369
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:27,680
of the Los Angeles Counter Terrorist Unit
as the man responsible for saving Palmer.

370
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,040
- Still nothing.
- One...

371
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:48,800
- Have you searched the floor yet? Have you?
- Not yet, sir.

372
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,320
Teri!

373
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,720
Teri? Teri!

374
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,800
Teri!

375
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,800
Oh, my God.

376
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,800
Come on. Come on.

377
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,760
No. Oh, God.

378
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:23,160
Teri? Teri?

379
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:25,440
No. Teri, no.

380
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,720
No.

381
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,360
Teri. Please. No.

382
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,000
Come on, baby. Come on. Come on.

383
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:43,480
- I'm glad you moved back in, Daddy.
- Me too, sweetie.

384
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:46,160
- OK.
- Good.

385
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:49,640
- I really appreciate that.
- You really, really appreciate it?

386
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:52,640
- You really appreciate it? How much?
- Jack.

387
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,680
I'm so sorry. So sorry.
