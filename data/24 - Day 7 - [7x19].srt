1
00:00:15,565 --> 00:00:17,166
RENEE:
Jack!

2
00:00:17,233 --> 00:00:18,634
We need a medic!
(gasping)

3
00:00:18,702 --> 00:00:20,536
The bioagent is more virulent
than we thought.

4
00:00:20,604 --> 00:00:21,870
All we're doing
here is just

5
00:00:21,938 --> 00:00:23,706
masking the symptoms.
I understand.

6
00:00:23,774 --> 00:00:26,342
There's something
you may want to consider.

7
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:27,576
What's that?

8
00:00:27,644 --> 00:00:28,644
A possible treatment

9
00:00:28,712 --> 00:00:30,313
using stems cells from

10
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:31,580
a genetically-compatible donor.

11
00:00:31,648 --> 00:00:33,549
I saw your file.
It says you have a daughter.

12
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:34,917
I don't want my daughter
involved in this.

13
00:00:34,984 --> 00:00:36,519
Daddy.

14
00:00:36,586 --> 00:00:39,488
Agent Walker told me
that there's a chance,

15
00:00:39,556 --> 00:00:42,425
a small chance
that I could help you,

16
00:00:42,492 --> 00:00:44,259
and you don't want me to.

17
00:00:44,328 --> 00:00:46,495
I'm dying,

18
00:00:46,563 --> 00:00:48,163
and whatever small
chance there is

19
00:00:48,231 --> 00:00:50,032
to stop that
from happening,

20
00:00:50,099 --> 00:00:52,100
it is not worth the pain

21
00:00:52,168 --> 00:00:55,070
for me to let you sit there
and watch me die.

22
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:58,641
Jack, Hodges has
13 Python missiles

23
00:00:58,709 --> 00:01:00,376
armed with the bioweapons.

24
00:01:00,444 --> 00:01:02,645
He demanded
that I recall the planes,

25
00:01:02,713 --> 00:01:03,646
or he would launch.

26
00:01:03,714 --> 00:01:05,715
Tony Almeida is still
inside Starkwood.

27
00:01:05,782 --> 00:01:07,850
He believes he can gain access
to the fuel depot,

28
00:01:07,917 --> 00:01:09,318
and lay a series
of explosive charges,

29
00:01:09,386 --> 00:01:10,486
and take the missiles out.

30
00:01:10,554 --> 00:01:11,754
What do you think you're doing?

31
00:01:11,822 --> 00:01:14,557
You're gonna take me down
to the fuel tanks.

32
00:01:19,195 --> 00:01:20,095
You're too late.

33
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:21,096
(grunts)

34
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:22,931
(alarm sounding)

35
00:01:24,835 --> 00:01:25,501
(beeping)

36
00:01:25,569 --> 00:01:27,703
(explosions)

37
00:01:29,639 --> 00:01:32,074
Jonas, we've taken out
your missiles.

38
00:01:32,141 --> 00:01:33,609
It's over,
and you're under arrest.

39
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:36,078
You can't even begin to
imagine what you're up against.

40
00:01:36,145 --> 00:01:37,279
What are you talking about?

41
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:39,114
You'll find out.

42
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:40,616
Agent Moss, this is Davis
at Auxiliary Gate Six.

43
00:01:40,684 --> 00:01:42,651
I have a Starkwood op
in custody.

44
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:44,319
He was carrying a canister
of the bioweapon.

45
00:01:44,388 --> 00:01:46,689
Are you sure?
I'm looking at
it right now.

46
00:01:49,393 --> 00:01:50,593
One of the
Starkwood ops--

47
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:52,361
he's got a canister
of the bioweapon.

48
00:01:52,429 --> 00:01:54,930
So I need you to close
down all access roads,

49
00:01:54,998 --> 00:01:56,198
and alert perimeter
units and Metro Police.

50
00:01:56,266 --> 00:01:57,566
Janis, get me
D.C. Metro.

51
00:01:57,634 --> 00:01:58,967
I'm gonna pursue
from the air.

52
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:00,202
Let's go!

53
00:02:02,572 --> 00:02:05,408
Come on!

54
00:02:06,142 --> 00:02:07,209
(groans)

55
00:02:07,277 --> 00:02:09,678
(gasping)

56
00:02:09,746 --> 00:02:10,846
(choking)

57
00:02:10,914 --> 00:02:12,214
I'm okay.

58
00:02:12,282 --> 00:02:13,982
(coughing)
Tony! Tony!

59
00:02:16,085 --> 00:02:19,522
Oh, God. Oh...

60
00:02:19,589 --> 00:02:20,556
(groans)

61
00:02:20,624 --> 00:02:21,524
(muffled groan)

62
00:02:21,591 --> 00:02:23,592
(groans and gasps)

63
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:32,768
(phone ringing)

64
00:02:32,836 --> 00:02:33,936
Yeah?

65
00:02:34,003 --> 00:02:35,203
Patricia, Matt.

66
00:02:35,271 --> 00:02:36,939
I just got off
with Secret Service.

67
00:02:37,006 --> 00:02:39,374
You're cleared with White House
security at the south entrance.

68
00:02:39,443 --> 00:02:42,177
How soon do you think
you'll get there?

69
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:43,512
Uh, within the half-hour.

70
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,781
Do you have any more information
why Hodges was arrested?

71
00:02:45,849 --> 00:02:47,149
They didn't give me a lot.

72
00:02:47,216 --> 00:02:48,551
Apparently,
Jonas was in some kind

73
00:02:48,618 --> 00:02:49,919
of policy meeting
with the president,

74
00:02:49,986 --> 00:02:51,520
and things got out of hand.

75
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:54,156
That's when he requested
his favorite attorney.

76
00:02:54,223 --> 00:02:55,424
I'm flattered.

77
00:02:55,492 --> 00:02:58,093
I'll call you
after I've spoken to him.

78
00:03:17,146 --> 00:03:18,647
(door closes)

79
00:03:38,768 --> 00:03:39,969
Hurry it up.

80
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:09,899
Janis, we just got
an ID on the suspect.

81
00:04:09,966 --> 00:04:12,001
One of Starkwood's
security cameras

82
00:04:12,068 --> 00:04:14,403
picked him up leaving
the compound; he was
carrying a backpack.

83
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:16,005
Robert Galvez, two-year
Starkwood employee,

84
00:04:16,072 --> 00:04:17,973
former special forces.

85
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:20,776
Relay that information
to Larry-- he needs to
know who he's tracking.

86
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:22,645
I've been trying.
He's not answering his comm.

87
00:04:22,712 --> 00:04:24,246
How far away is backup?

88
00:04:24,313 --> 00:04:26,949
They're still a few minutes out,
but Agent Park's teams

89
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:29,451
have secured a
four-block perimeter.

90
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:32,021
The bioweapons canister
is secured within the cordon.

91
00:04:32,088 --> 00:04:33,321
Get Galvez' picture
and description out

92
00:04:33,389 --> 00:04:34,623
to Tactical and
distribute department wide.

93
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:36,559
- Got it.
- And keep trying Larry.

94
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:40,095
JANIS:
To all units,

95
00:04:40,163 --> 00:04:42,031
I'm uploading a photo
of the suspect

96
00:04:42,098 --> 00:04:43,532
to all units' PDAs.

97
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,100
His name is Robert Galvez.

98
00:04:45,168 --> 00:04:46,535
Be advised

99
00:04:46,603 --> 00:04:48,003
he has advanced
military training,

100
00:04:48,071 --> 00:04:49,805
so proceed with caution.

101
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:51,040
PARK:
Roger that.

102
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:57,245
(panting)

103
00:05:00,016 --> 00:05:01,951
(gunshot)
(yelling)

104
00:05:02,018 --> 00:05:04,019
(groaning)

105
00:05:07,991 --> 00:05:09,992
(panting)

106
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:15,931
(phone ringing)

107
00:05:20,036 --> 00:05:22,270
GALVEZ:
Almeida? Almeida, are you there?

108
00:05:22,338 --> 00:05:24,172
Are you in a secure location?

109
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,976
I'm holed up in a storage yard
near the projects on Jefferson.

110
00:05:27,043 --> 00:05:28,343
But I just spotted a patrol.

111
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:29,745
I think I better keep moving.

112
00:05:29,813 --> 00:05:30,913
No, don't.

113
00:05:30,981 --> 00:05:32,081
(panting)

114
00:05:32,148 --> 00:05:33,949
The FBI's got the entire
perimeter locked down.

115
00:05:34,017 --> 00:05:35,317
And they know who you are.

116
00:05:35,384 --> 00:05:37,185
How?
TONY:
They have a picture.

117
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:40,089
Which means the search teams can
ID you on sight.

118
00:05:40,156 --> 00:05:42,290
Just stay put
until I can get a read

119
00:05:42,358 --> 00:05:44,493
on their search protocols,
and I'll guide you out.

120
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,194
I should have never have let you
talk me into helping you.

121
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:48,497
I promise you,
that canister you stole for me

122
00:05:48,564 --> 00:05:51,600
is worth a lot of money
to the people I'm working for.

123
00:05:51,668 --> 00:05:53,535
Hell of a lot of good that
money's gonna do me in prison.

124
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:55,403
Just shut up and do
what I tell you to do.

125
00:05:55,471 --> 00:05:58,741
Guard the canister, stay put,
and wait for my call.

126
00:05:58,808 --> 00:06:01,744
(siren blaring)

127
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:07,950
(tires squeal)

128
00:06:09,218 --> 00:06:10,485
(siren stops)

129
00:06:10,553 --> 00:06:11,920
We've got agents down.

130
00:06:11,988 --> 00:06:15,423
Get a med team
out here now.

131
00:06:15,491 --> 00:06:17,526
Almeida?

132
00:06:17,593 --> 00:06:19,594
Almeida, can you hear me?

133
00:06:20,864 --> 00:06:21,964
What happened?

134
00:06:22,032 --> 00:06:23,298
Where's the suspect?

135
00:06:23,366 --> 00:06:24,599
He ambushed us.

136
00:06:24,668 --> 00:06:26,735
Did you see
where he went?

137
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:27,903
(panting)

138
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:29,738
I don't know.

139
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:31,073
Renee, I just got confirmation

140
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:33,341
the Tac Team has arrived
at the scene.

141
00:06:33,409 --> 00:06:35,277
Do we have a
20 on Larry?
Not yet.

142
00:06:35,344 --> 00:06:37,713
KIM:
Excuse me,
Agent Walker.

143
00:06:37,781 --> 00:06:39,048
I know you're busy.
Kim.

144
00:06:39,115 --> 00:06:41,050
I just came to say good-bye.

145
00:06:41,117 --> 00:06:42,450
Good-bye? Where are you going?

146
00:06:42,518 --> 00:06:44,153
Back to L.A.

147
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,888
Um, I don't understand.

148
00:06:45,955 --> 00:06:47,089
You're not going through

149
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:48,924
with the treatment
to help your father?

150
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:51,393
I mean, it's his only
chance for a cure.

151
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:52,895
I know that, and so does he.

152
00:06:52,962 --> 00:06:54,429
But it's a slim one,

153
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:56,431
and he believes

154
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:58,233
it's not worth taking, so...

155
00:06:58,301 --> 00:07:01,804
If he's going to die,
he wants it to be on his terms.

156
00:07:01,871 --> 00:07:04,840
Yes, but can't you
change his mind?

157
00:07:04,908 --> 00:07:06,675
I would think you'd know by now

158
00:07:06,743 --> 00:07:08,677
that no one can change
my father's mind

159
00:07:08,745 --> 00:07:09,845
when it's made up.

160
00:07:09,913 --> 00:07:12,347
I'm... I'm sorry.

161
00:07:12,415 --> 00:07:15,317
I'm sorry
that I put you in this position.

162
00:07:15,384 --> 00:07:16,551
No, don't be.

163
00:07:16,619 --> 00:07:18,687
I'm grateful to you,
Agent Walker.

164
00:07:18,755 --> 00:07:21,256
My father and I got to say
a lot of things to each other.

165
00:07:21,324 --> 00:07:22,524
I wish I could have said more,

166
00:07:22,592 --> 00:07:24,960
but I don't want
to cause him any more pain.

167
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:25,994
JANIS:
Renee?

168
00:07:26,062 --> 00:07:27,262
Agent Park is on the phone
for you.

169
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:30,465
I need to take this.

170
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:33,668
I understand.

171
00:07:33,737 --> 00:07:35,537
Good luck.

172
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:40,976
This is Walker.

173
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:42,544
Agent Moss is dead.

174
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:45,948
What?

175
00:07:46,015 --> 00:07:48,817
Apparently, he was killed
in an ambush by the suspect.

176
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:50,052
The chopper pilot, too.

177
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,155
Tony Almeida's been shot,
but he's alive.

178
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:55,423
I've got medical personnel
working on him now.

179
00:07:56,459 --> 00:07:58,460
Agent Walker?

180
00:08:00,029 --> 00:08:02,965
Do we have any lead on Galvez?

181
00:08:03,032 --> 00:08:04,466
No, but the area's
been cordoned off.

182
00:08:04,533 --> 00:08:05,901
He couldn't
have gotten far.

183
00:08:05,969 --> 00:08:08,503
We're setting up an operations
base here on the scene

184
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:09,805
to coordinate the manhunt.

185
00:08:09,873 --> 00:08:11,373
How do you want to proceed?

186
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,775
Me?

187
00:08:12,842 --> 00:08:14,843
You're the ranking agent
in charge now.

188
00:08:19,215 --> 00:08:21,150
Maintain the perimeter.

189
00:08:21,217 --> 00:08:23,618
Begin a south-north sweep.

190
00:08:23,686 --> 00:08:27,389
I'll chopper out a team and
meet you there as soon as I can.

191
00:08:27,456 --> 00:08:29,124
Agent Walker, I have more
than enough personnel.

192
00:08:29,192 --> 00:08:30,425
You don't need to be involved

193
00:08:30,493 --> 00:08:32,161
in the search.
Yes, I do.

194
00:08:32,228 --> 00:08:35,164
Keep me posted
if you hear anything.

195
00:08:35,231 --> 00:08:37,166
Yes, ma'am.

196
00:08:37,233 --> 00:08:38,566
Larry?

197
00:08:38,634 --> 00:08:42,037
He was killed in a shootout
with the suspect.

198
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:44,506
Oh, God.

199
00:08:44,573 --> 00:08:46,474
I need you to brief the
White House on what's happened.

200
00:08:46,542 --> 00:08:48,277
Call Dr. Macer and have her
deploy a HazMat team

201
00:08:48,344 --> 00:08:49,444
to the perimeter line.

202
00:08:49,512 --> 00:08:50,612
Assemble a team

203
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,881
to chopper
out with me.

204
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:56,018
I'm so sorry.

205
00:08:56,085 --> 00:08:58,653
Someone's going to need
to notify Larry's ex-wife.

206
00:09:00,857 --> 00:09:03,125
Probably shouldn't be me.

207
00:09:03,193 --> 00:09:04,993
It's okay. I'll take care of it.

208
00:09:13,269 --> 00:09:14,402
All right.

209
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:17,239
We've debriefed on hours
8:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m.

210
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:20,542
pertaining to the CIP recovery
and the capture of Ike Dubaku.

211
00:09:20,609 --> 00:09:21,877
Now, Mr. Bauer,

212
00:09:21,945 --> 00:09:23,879
maybe you'd like
to take a break.

213
00:09:23,947 --> 00:09:26,481
No. We need to finish this
while I still can.

214
00:09:26,549 --> 00:09:27,649
Let's go.

215
00:09:27,717 --> 00:09:28,783
Now, according

216
00:09:28,852 --> 00:09:30,485
to your earlier statement,

217
00:09:30,553 --> 00:09:32,221
it was about this
time you received

218
00:09:32,288 --> 00:09:34,389
intel regarding the imminent
attack on the White House.

219
00:09:34,457 --> 00:09:36,959
Tony Almeida provided me
with the intel,

220
00:09:37,026 --> 00:09:38,293
but we did not know

221
00:09:38,361 --> 00:09:40,662
the White House was
a target at that time.

222
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:42,297
And who was Mr.
Almeida's source?

223
00:09:42,365 --> 00:09:44,967
He was interrogating
a mercenary.

224
00:09:45,034 --> 00:09:46,735
Did Almeida give
you a name?

225
00:09:46,802 --> 00:09:48,603
Um...

226
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,672
Yeah. Sorry.

227
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:55,510
Car... Cardiff. He said
his name was Vincent Cardiff.

228
00:09:55,578 --> 00:09:58,247
Did you yourself
question the source?

229
00:09:58,314 --> 00:09:59,982
No.

230
00:10:00,049 --> 00:10:01,250
He didn't survive
Tony's interrogation,

231
00:10:01,317 --> 00:10:03,919
but he was the one
who provided us with the intel

232
00:10:03,987 --> 00:10:05,087
on the upcoming attack.

233
00:10:05,154 --> 00:10:06,521
But we did not know

234
00:10:06,589 --> 00:10:08,556
that the White House was the
intended target at that time.

235
00:10:08,624 --> 00:10:10,592
We did not know the White House
was the intended target...

236
00:10:10,659 --> 00:10:11,659
Mr. Bauer?

237
00:10:13,229 --> 00:10:16,298
You sure you don't want
to take that break?

238
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:18,433
Um, I'm repeating myself again.

239
00:10:18,501 --> 00:10:20,435
I'm sorry.
(knock at door)

240
00:10:20,503 --> 00:10:22,037
(sighs)

241
00:10:22,105 --> 00:10:23,038
Here's the data file

242
00:10:23,106 --> 00:10:24,339
you asked for, sir.

243
00:10:24,407 --> 00:10:26,041
MAN:
Tom, we need to move.

244
00:10:26,109 --> 00:10:27,575
Agent Walker's got
our assignments.

245
00:10:29,913 --> 00:10:31,914
Excuse me.

246
00:10:36,752 --> 00:10:39,687
RENEE:
We're not going to lose
control of this situation.

247
00:10:39,755 --> 00:10:42,291
I know that most of you are
tired, working double shifts,

248
00:10:42,358 --> 00:10:44,893
but I need each and every one
of you focused and alert

249
00:10:44,961 --> 00:10:46,661
if we are going
to locate the suspect

250
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:48,563
and secure the bioweapon
canister that he's carrying.

251
00:10:48,631 --> 00:10:50,132
While I am out in the field,

252
00:10:50,199 --> 00:10:51,466
you will pass
all pertinent information

253
00:10:51,534 --> 00:10:52,801
out of this office
through Janis.

254
00:10:52,868 --> 00:10:55,137
Let's get to work. Adams,
you and your men are with me.

255
00:10:55,204 --> 00:10:57,572
Renee? Renee?

256
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,374
I'll meet you
at the helipad.

257
00:10:59,442 --> 00:11:00,909
The bioweapon's
still out there?

258
00:11:00,977 --> 00:11:02,044
We have it contained.

259
00:11:02,111 --> 00:11:03,545
Wait a second.

260
00:11:03,612 --> 00:11:04,746
Wait a second.

261
00:11:04,814 --> 00:11:06,748
Just tell me what the
hell is going on.

262
00:11:06,816 --> 00:11:08,750
A Starkwood operative
by the name of Robert Galvez

263
00:11:08,818 --> 00:11:10,385
got away with a canister
of the pathogen.

264
00:11:10,453 --> 00:11:12,387
We have him trapped inside
a perimeter a mile or so

265
00:11:12,455 --> 00:11:13,555
from Starkwood's compound.

266
00:11:13,622 --> 00:11:15,023
Is Larry in command
of the perimeter?

267
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:16,524
He was killed
in a firefight.

268
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:17,592
What?

269
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:19,094
Tony was injured.

270
00:11:19,162 --> 00:11:20,728
He's at the scene
with the advance team.

271
00:11:20,796 --> 00:11:22,597
Larry's dead?

272
00:11:22,665 --> 00:11:24,366
We have two agents down.

273
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:25,467
Yes. I have to go.

274
00:11:33,809 --> 00:11:35,743
You're lucky.
An inch to the left,

275
00:11:35,811 --> 00:11:37,846
the bullet might have nicked
your splenic artery.

276
00:11:37,913 --> 00:11:39,781
You need to get yourself
checked out at the
hospital, sir.

277
00:11:39,849 --> 00:11:41,216
Yeah, I can't do that
right now.

278
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:43,085
(groans)
Let me get you something
for the pain.

279
00:11:43,152 --> 00:11:45,354
No, I, I need to keep
my head clear.

280
00:11:45,421 --> 00:11:48,223
Sweep 9, this is Mobile Command,
what's your status?

281
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:50,725
Mobile Command, this is Sweep 9,
Southeast grid 211 clear.

282
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:52,560
Moving on.
Copy that, Sweep 9.

283
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:53,695
Sweep 7, what's
your position?

284
00:11:53,762 --> 00:11:55,697
Clearing 214. Nothing so far.

285
00:11:55,764 --> 00:11:57,065
No sign of him?

286
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:58,100
Don't worry.

287
00:11:58,167 --> 00:11:59,267
We'll find him.

288
00:11:59,335 --> 00:12:01,069
You should get some rest.

289
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:03,138
Thanks.

290
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:07,342
...this is Mobile Command,
status check, over.

291
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:08,743
(dialing)

292
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:11,880
GALVEZ:
Yeah?
Yeah, they're sweeping

293
00:12:11,947 --> 00:12:13,548
north, clearing grids.

294
00:12:13,616 --> 00:12:14,782
You've got a clear path

295
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:17,386
on Jefferson all the way up
to 12th and 13th Street.

296
00:12:17,453 --> 00:12:19,454
That should be the last sector
they're searching.

297
00:12:19,522 --> 00:12:20,755
Judging by their progress,

298
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:22,357
it'll give you
about 30 minutes.

299
00:12:22,425 --> 00:12:23,725
Should be plenty
of time.

300
00:12:23,792 --> 00:12:25,894
Time for what?

301
00:12:25,961 --> 00:12:27,896
You still got that
C-4 I gave you?

302
00:12:27,963 --> 00:12:29,898
Yeah. I got it.
All right.

303
00:12:29,965 --> 00:12:31,900
I want you to find
a structure,

304
00:12:31,967 --> 00:12:33,668
a store, warehouse,
something big enough

305
00:12:33,736 --> 00:12:35,303
where they have to
enter and search.

306
00:12:35,371 --> 00:12:38,606
We need to draw as many of them
into the building as possible,

307
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:40,108
then blow it.

308
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:42,777
You want me to blow up a couple
of dozen FBI agents?

309
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:44,079
You got a problem with that?

310
00:12:44,147 --> 00:12:45,280
They're still gonna have
the perimeter locked down.

311
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:46,515
I don't see how doing this

312
00:12:46,582 --> 00:12:48,083
is gonna get me out of here
with the canister.

313
00:12:48,151 --> 00:12:49,951
Yeah, I've got that worked out.

314
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:52,620
(engine whooshing)

315
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,667
Jack, what the hell
are you doing?

316
00:13:05,734 --> 00:13:07,369
I'm going with you.

317
00:13:07,437 --> 00:13:08,603
You're ill.

318
00:13:08,671 --> 00:13:10,505
If my condition interferes
with your operation,

319
00:13:10,573 --> 00:13:11,540
I will stand down.

320
00:13:11,607 --> 00:13:13,508
I give you
my word.
Jack...

321
00:13:13,576 --> 00:13:14,609
You want keep arguing
about this,

322
00:13:14,677 --> 00:13:15,643
waste more time? Fine.

323
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:17,312
I'm not getting out.

324
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:22,584
(propellers whirring)

325
00:13:40,488 --> 00:13:41,988
Good morning.

326
00:13:42,056 --> 00:13:44,124
Good morning.

327
00:13:44,488 --> 00:13:45,588
Ms. Eames.

328
00:13:45,656 --> 00:13:47,256
You're Jonas Hodges'
attorney.

329
00:13:47,324 --> 00:13:48,991
That's right.

330
00:13:49,059 --> 00:13:50,560
They told us
to expect you.

331
00:13:50,627 --> 00:13:52,195
I just need you to
place your thumb

332
00:13:52,262 --> 00:13:54,263
against the glass.

333
00:13:55,299 --> 00:13:56,499
(beeps)

334
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,741
Okay. Sergeant Cadden
will escort you

335
00:14:05,809 --> 00:14:07,810
to the holding area.

336
00:14:09,413 --> 00:14:11,414
Thank you.

337
00:14:12,982 --> 00:14:14,917
How could this man have
gotten out of Starkwood

338
00:14:14,984 --> 00:14:16,452
with a canister of
the bioweapon?

339
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,486
No one's sure.

340
00:14:17,554 --> 00:14:18,987
But he's already murdered
four people.

341
00:14:19,055 --> 00:14:21,056
Including Larry Moss.

342
00:14:23,093 --> 00:14:25,361
The FBI has
tracked him

343
00:14:25,429 --> 00:14:26,529
to a nearby residential
district.

344
00:14:26,597 --> 00:14:28,030
They've sealed
off the area

345
00:14:28,098 --> 00:14:30,199
and are conducting
a thorough search.

346
00:14:30,267 --> 00:14:32,235
Mom, this man Galvez is
a Starkwood operative.

347
00:14:32,302 --> 00:14:34,870
Clearly, Hodges is
behind this.

348
00:14:34,938 --> 00:14:36,205
Maybe.

349
00:14:36,273 --> 00:14:37,840
What do you mean,
maybe?

350
00:14:39,876 --> 00:14:41,544
As Hodges was
taken away,

351
00:14:41,612 --> 00:14:43,579
he said it wasn't over.

352
00:14:43,647 --> 00:14:46,716
He alluded to others,
called himself

353
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:49,619
a small cog in a very large
machine that I wouldn't

354
00:14:49,686 --> 00:14:51,153
be able to stop.
He was ranting.

355
00:14:51,221 --> 00:14:53,589
That doesn't mean he wasn't
telling the truth.

356
00:14:53,657 --> 00:14:55,758
We need to find out what
Hodges knows about this.

357
00:14:55,825 --> 00:14:58,861
I want him taken to the FBI
for interrogation.

358
00:14:58,928 --> 00:15:00,896
He's a sociopath, Mom.

359
00:15:00,964 --> 00:15:02,965
He's not going to talk.
He's going to want

360
00:15:03,032 --> 00:15:05,801
to make some kind of deal in
exchange for his cooperation.

361
00:15:08,505 --> 00:15:10,640
Mom, you're not
considering that...

362
00:15:10,707 --> 00:15:11,774
Olivia...

363
00:15:11,841 --> 00:15:14,744
You know what this man is,
what he did to Roger.

364
00:15:14,811 --> 00:15:16,812
Just get him to FBI.

365
00:15:25,322 --> 00:15:27,256
(buzzer)

366
00:15:27,324 --> 00:15:28,291
Mr. Hodges.

367
00:15:28,358 --> 00:15:29,425
Your attorney's

368
00:15:29,493 --> 00:15:31,427
here to see you.

369
00:15:31,495 --> 00:15:32,961
Well, it's about damn time.

370
00:15:35,999 --> 00:15:38,000
(clears throat)

371
00:15:43,072 --> 00:15:45,874
We're going to need
some privacy.

372
00:15:51,682 --> 00:15:53,316
You're a little taller than her.

373
00:15:53,383 --> 00:15:54,350
But it's

374
00:15:54,418 --> 00:15:56,352
a good look
for you.

375
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:58,354
Hello, Jonas.

376
00:15:58,422 --> 00:16:00,356
I'm not going to ask
how you got in.

377
00:16:00,424 --> 00:16:01,691
But I'm

378
00:16:01,758 --> 00:16:04,627
definitely interested in how
you're going to get me out.

379
00:16:06,129 --> 00:16:07,830
Jonas, you're in a very

380
00:16:07,897 --> 00:16:09,832
difficult position.

381
00:16:09,899 --> 00:16:11,834
And your actions today
have put everyone else

382
00:16:11,901 --> 00:16:13,502
in a very difficult
position.

383
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:15,338
Oh, I see.

384
00:16:15,405 --> 00:16:18,341
I've upset the cart, have I?

385
00:16:18,408 --> 00:16:21,344
Everyone's bent out of shape.

386
00:16:21,411 --> 00:16:23,346
Well, where the hell were they

387
00:16:23,413 --> 00:16:25,180
when the government came
after my company?

388
00:16:25,248 --> 00:16:27,850
When Senator Mayer and his
subpoena-waving goon squad

389
00:16:27,917 --> 00:16:30,386
were trying to ruin me
and everything I've built?

390
00:16:30,454 --> 00:16:32,421
You would have been
protected, Jonas.

391
00:16:32,489 --> 00:16:34,557
You and Starkwood.

392
00:16:34,624 --> 00:16:37,560
But you jeopardized
the plan.

393
00:16:37,627 --> 00:16:40,195
That bioweapon that you
developed for us was

394
00:16:40,263 --> 00:16:42,264
not intended for personal use.

395
00:16:42,332 --> 00:16:44,600
The consensus

396
00:16:44,668 --> 00:16:47,102
is that you've had
some sort of...

397
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:49,104
psychotic break.

398
00:16:49,172 --> 00:16:52,107
Well, the consensus is wrong.

399
00:16:52,175 --> 00:16:54,377
Coming from you right now,
that's not much comfort.

400
00:16:54,444 --> 00:16:56,412
I want to talk to them.

401
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,781
Get some form
of communication
between us.

402
00:16:58,849 --> 00:17:00,048
I want to talk to them.

403
00:17:00,116 --> 00:17:02,651
I think it's a little late
for that, Jonas.

404
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:04,820
You've brought undue attention
by showing your hand.

405
00:17:04,888 --> 00:17:06,121
Exposing yourself.

406
00:17:06,189 --> 00:17:07,390
And I'm sure you
could understand

407
00:17:07,457 --> 00:17:08,624
their concern that you may,

408
00:17:08,692 --> 00:17:11,126
in fact, expose the others
as well.

409
00:17:11,194 --> 00:17:13,829
How can I do that?
I don't know who they are.

410
00:17:13,897 --> 00:17:16,131
You know enough,
and they need
to be certain.

411
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:18,401
I think we can agree

412
00:17:18,468 --> 00:17:20,436
that there's no reason
for your family

413
00:17:20,504 --> 00:17:23,439
to pay for your
mistakes.

414
00:17:23,507 --> 00:17:25,107
Is that why you're here?

415
00:17:25,174 --> 00:17:26,442
To threaten my family.

416
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:27,976
On the contrary.

417
00:17:28,044 --> 00:17:31,246
I came to guarantee your
family's safety.

418
00:17:31,314 --> 00:17:33,949
If you do the right thing.

419
00:17:38,855 --> 00:17:41,290
This will induce

420
00:17:41,357 --> 00:17:44,293
cardiac arrest, and leave
no trace in your system.

421
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:47,463
A natural, dignified death.

422
00:17:47,531 --> 00:17:49,298
Without you to
prosecute,

423
00:17:49,365 --> 00:17:50,666
the case against
you and your

424
00:17:50,734 --> 00:17:53,602
company will be difficult,
likely impossible,

425
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:55,938
preserving at least
some small part

426
00:17:56,005 --> 00:17:58,974
of Starkwood's legacy
of patriotic service.

427
00:17:59,042 --> 00:18:01,844
Which I know is very important
to you.

428
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:21,897
(buzzer)

429
00:18:23,032 --> 00:18:24,700
Party's over,
counselor.

430
00:18:24,768 --> 00:18:26,234
We're moving him
to the Bureau.

431
00:18:26,302 --> 00:18:29,338
My client has invoked his right
to silence and to counsel.

432
00:18:29,405 --> 00:18:31,039
No one speaks to him

433
00:18:31,107 --> 00:18:33,041
unless in my presence,
is that understood?

434
00:18:33,109 --> 00:18:34,977
In some countries they'd
have shot him by now.

435
00:18:35,044 --> 00:18:37,079
Process him out.

436
00:18:49,893 --> 00:18:52,695
CADDEN:
Step out of the cell
and raise your arms.

437
00:18:52,762 --> 00:18:55,698
(dialing)

438
00:18:55,765 --> 00:18:57,165
(phone ringing)
Yes?

439
00:18:57,233 --> 00:18:58,400
I met with him.

440
00:18:58,468 --> 00:18:59,568
And?

441
00:18:59,636 --> 00:19:01,570
I'm quite certain
he understands our terms.

442
00:19:01,638 --> 00:19:03,572
They're transferring him
to the FBI for interrogation.

443
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,773
Will that be
a problem?

444
00:19:04,841 --> 00:19:06,308
Hopefully, it'll just
pressure him

445
00:19:06,376 --> 00:19:08,310
to resolve the situation
sooner rather than later.

446
00:19:08,378 --> 00:19:10,546
I'll be happy
when this is behind us.

447
00:19:10,614 --> 00:19:12,080
Have you heard
from Almeida?

448
00:19:12,148 --> 00:19:14,082
He called in before
I met with Hodges.

449
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:16,084
Has he secured
the canister?

450
00:19:16,152 --> 00:19:18,086
Soon.

451
00:19:18,154 --> 00:19:19,755
He's your guy.
Better not screw this up.

452
00:19:19,823 --> 00:19:23,859
Tony's been the one bright spot
in an otherwise dreary day.

453
00:19:23,927 --> 00:19:25,928
I have faith he'll come through.

454
00:19:27,964 --> 00:19:29,765
(phone ringing)

455
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:31,867
Yeah?

456
00:19:31,935 --> 00:19:33,602
I found a place to set up.

457
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:35,437
It's an abandoned
apartment building

458
00:19:35,505 --> 00:19:36,772
just shy of the north
perimeter line.

459
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:40,576
1297 Rincon,
corner of 12th.

460
00:19:40,644 --> 00:19:41,977
Yeah, I see it.

461
00:19:42,045 --> 00:19:44,312
Sweep teams are
just entering

462
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:45,981
three sectors
to the south.

463
00:19:46,049 --> 00:19:47,650
You've got less
than 20 minutes.

464
00:19:47,717 --> 00:19:48,884
That doesn't give me much time.

465
00:19:48,952 --> 00:19:50,352
No, it doesn't,
so maybe you

466
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:52,788
should get off
the phone and get to it.

467
00:19:52,856 --> 00:19:53,856
(phone beeps)

468
00:20:32,862 --> 00:20:36,264
I lost two partners
in a row.

469
00:20:36,332 --> 00:20:38,467
Early on.

470
00:20:40,503 --> 00:20:42,504
I couldn't handle it.

471
00:20:45,108 --> 00:20:47,710
I guess that's why
over the last ten years,

472
00:20:47,777 --> 00:20:50,178
I've pretty much worked alone.

473
00:20:52,215 --> 00:20:54,382
It's all right
for you to be feeling

474
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:56,885
what you feel.

475
00:20:56,953 --> 00:20:59,021
And if you can't
do this tonight,

476
00:20:59,089 --> 00:21:01,056
that's all right, too.

477
00:21:01,124 --> 00:21:02,390
Just don't try
and pretend

478
00:21:02,458 --> 00:21:05,060
like you're not feeling
anything.

479
00:21:05,128 --> 00:21:06,962
That's how you make a mistake.

480
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:09,798
Please, Jack, don't
tell me what to feel

481
00:21:09,866 --> 00:21:11,734
and don't tell me
how to feel it.

482
00:21:31,955 --> 00:21:33,188
Agent Walker.

483
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:42,564
(Renee murmurs)

484
00:21:42,632 --> 00:21:44,633
He's over there.

485
00:21:47,937 --> 00:21:50,105
ALMEIDA:
Jack!
Where is he?

486
00:21:50,173 --> 00:21:51,774
This way.
You okay?

487
00:21:51,841 --> 00:21:52,841
Yeah, I got lucky.

488
00:21:52,909 --> 00:21:54,342
The bullet went
straight through.

489
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:55,778
Didn't think
I'd see you out here.

490
00:21:55,845 --> 00:21:57,846
I'm only here for
observation.

491
00:22:00,249 --> 00:22:03,251
You do not have
to do this.

492
00:22:04,754 --> 00:22:05,921
Show me.

493
00:22:39,475 --> 00:22:41,510
Cover him up.

494
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,994
I'm sorry about Larry.

495
00:22:46,062 --> 00:22:47,930
How the hell did this happen?

496
00:22:47,997 --> 00:22:51,399
It all went down
pretty fast, I mean...

497
00:22:51,467 --> 00:22:54,169
We were ambushed before we
got out of the helicopter.

498
00:22:54,237 --> 00:22:57,272
The chopper pilot
was hit first.

499
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:59,842
I was unarmed, so
Larry laid down cover

500
00:22:59,909 --> 00:23:01,844
so I could get clear.

501
00:23:01,911 --> 00:23:04,379
I don't remember a lot, but
I definitely heard auto-fire.

502
00:23:06,049 --> 00:23:07,883
As I was tagged,
Larry came over

503
00:23:07,951 --> 00:23:10,152
to help me out and
that's when he was hit.

504
00:23:11,187 --> 00:23:12,621
I blacked out after that.

505
00:23:12,688 --> 00:23:15,690
But I'm pretty sure Larry
saved my life.

506
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:17,793
Larry was hit
with heavy ordnance.

507
00:23:17,861 --> 00:23:19,261
Shotgun rounds, armor piercing.

508
00:23:19,328 --> 00:23:21,029
You were obviously hit
with something smaller.

509
00:23:21,097 --> 00:23:22,597
Jacketed.
MED TECH:
I treated Mr. Almeida.

510
00:23:22,665 --> 00:23:24,833
His wound was consistent
with a nine millimeter.

511
00:23:24,901 --> 00:23:26,835
JACK: You sure
it wasn't a .45?

512
00:23:26,903 --> 00:23:29,337
MED TECH:
Not likely-- the entry
was too small. Why?

513
00:23:29,405 --> 00:23:32,374
Because you have spent
.45 casings in evidence.

514
00:23:32,441 --> 00:23:37,112
Galvez had access to the weapons
inside the FBI vehicle he stole.

515
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:39,114
He probably switched
in the middle of the fight.

516
00:23:39,182 --> 00:23:40,649
That many weapons?

517
00:23:40,716 --> 00:23:42,617
In the time frame that
you described the ambush?

518
00:23:42,685 --> 00:23:44,019
It doesn't add up.

519
00:23:44,087 --> 00:23:46,989
Okay, so what
are you saying?
Someone was with him.

520
00:23:47,056 --> 00:23:50,458
Like I said, it all
happened pretty fast, but...

521
00:23:50,526 --> 00:23:52,227
I mean, I didn't
think so.

522
00:23:52,295 --> 00:23:55,798
I guess it makes sense.

523
00:23:55,865 --> 00:23:58,066
One man didn't do this alone.
He had help.

524
00:23:58,134 --> 00:24:01,203
I'll tell Park
to alert the field.

525
00:24:01,271 --> 00:24:03,205
You sure you're okay?

526
00:24:03,273 --> 00:24:05,007
Yeah, I'm fine.

527
00:24:05,074 --> 00:24:06,641
Good.

528
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:25,917
Hello?

529
00:24:25,984 --> 00:24:27,451
Did I wake you?

530
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:29,153
Who could sleep after
what happened today?

531
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,955
How did it go with your father?

532
00:24:33,926 --> 00:24:35,893
Sweetheart, what is it?

533
00:24:35,961 --> 00:24:37,461
What happened?

534
00:24:38,496 --> 00:24:40,698
He's dying, Stephen.

535
00:24:40,766 --> 00:24:42,466
What?

536
00:24:42,534 --> 00:24:45,903
He was exposed to something.

537
00:24:45,971 --> 00:24:47,672
Like a biological agent.

538
00:24:47,739 --> 00:24:49,306
It had something
to do with the attacks

539
00:24:49,374 --> 00:24:51,008
that took place earlier today.

540
00:24:51,076 --> 00:24:55,046
Kim, honey, I'm so sorry.

541
00:24:55,113 --> 00:24:59,450
Um, isn't there anything
that they can do?

542
00:25:01,019 --> 00:25:02,853
No.

543
00:25:02,921 --> 00:25:04,622
I'm coming back home.

544
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:06,323
Don't you want to stay?
Don't you wanna

545
00:25:06,391 --> 00:25:09,326
be with him as long as you can?

546
00:25:09,394 --> 00:25:11,328
My presence,

547
00:25:11,396 --> 00:25:12,897
with what he's
going through right now,

548
00:25:12,965 --> 00:25:14,665
will only make things worse.

549
00:25:14,733 --> 00:25:19,136
Did you at least, um,

550
00:25:19,204 --> 00:25:21,572
did you tell him about
his granddaughter?

551
00:25:23,108 --> 00:25:24,942
(sighing)

552
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:26,143
Kim?

553
00:25:26,211 --> 00:25:27,411
I couldn't, Stephen.

554
00:25:27,479 --> 00:25:29,146
I couldn't bring
myself to tell him

555
00:25:29,214 --> 00:25:32,717
I wasn't the only person
he was leaving behind.

556
00:25:32,784 --> 00:25:35,987
Telling him about Teri
would've only made it worse.

557
00:25:36,054 --> 00:25:38,522
I'm gonna try
and get on the 7:10.

558
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:40,992
If I do, I'll be
back in L.A. by 9:00.

559
00:25:41,059 --> 00:25:42,326
Okay.

560
00:25:42,393 --> 00:25:45,195
You can always leave later,
if you change your mind.

561
00:25:45,263 --> 00:25:48,766
t.

562
00:25:48,834 --> 00:25:50,735
I love you both.

563
00:25:50,802 --> 00:25:53,370
We love you, too.

564
00:25:53,438 --> 00:25:55,439
Bye.

565
00:25:58,877 --> 00:26:00,377
(sniffles)

566
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:09,020
(over comm):
Mobile Command, this is Sweep 9.

567
00:26:09,087 --> 00:26:10,121
221 is clear.

568
00:26:10,188 --> 00:26:12,690
Copy, 9. Proceed to 224.

569
00:26:12,758 --> 00:26:16,226
Why has that area of the
grid not been cleared?

570
00:26:16,294 --> 00:26:18,195
Sweep 3, why have you
not cleared 219?

571
00:26:18,263 --> 00:26:19,830
Mobile Command, we're
encountering some resistance

572
00:26:19,898 --> 00:26:21,265
from neighborhood residents.

573
00:26:21,332 --> 00:26:23,034
They're not happy about
their homes being searched

574
00:26:23,101 --> 00:26:24,969
without a warrant
at 2:30 in the morning.

575
00:26:25,037 --> 00:26:26,871
I'm concerned about their
safety, not their happiness.

576
00:26:26,938 --> 00:26:29,106
Whoever is helping Galvez
may be providing him shelter

577
00:26:29,174 --> 00:26:31,208
in one of those houses.
If those civilians are

578
00:26:31,276 --> 00:26:33,077
interfering in that sweep,
arrest them, but get that

579
00:26:33,145 --> 00:26:34,444
area cleared.
Do you understand?

580
00:26:34,512 --> 00:26:36,446
Copy.

581
00:26:36,514 --> 00:26:37,748
Jack?

582
00:26:37,816 --> 00:26:39,083
(shuddering):
Excuse me...

583
00:26:52,564 --> 00:26:55,232
(panting)

584
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:57,301
(groaning, shuddering)

585
00:27:06,712 --> 00:27:08,813
(panting)

586
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:17,621
It's an antiseizure medicine.

587
00:27:17,689 --> 00:27:20,224
I should've used
it earlier.

588
00:27:20,291 --> 00:27:21,992
Jack, what are you
doing out here?

589
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:25,362
Why don't you go back to FBI
medical and let them treat you?

590
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:27,965
There is no treatment.

591
00:27:28,033 --> 00:27:29,333
There's no cure.

592
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,467
Wait.

593
00:27:32,337 --> 00:27:34,872
I'm sorry.

594
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:36,273
I didn't know.

595
00:27:36,341 --> 00:27:38,209
Yeah.

596
00:27:38,276 --> 00:27:40,144
Why are you in the field?

597
00:27:40,212 --> 00:27:42,646
Agent Walker just lost
her partner, Tony.

598
00:27:45,416 --> 00:27:49,286
I thought I could help.
I owe her that much.

599
00:27:49,354 --> 00:27:51,856
Agent Stoller to Mobile Command.
Code Yellow.

600
00:27:51,923 --> 00:27:53,523
Go ahead, Agent Stoller,
this is Mobile Command.

601
00:27:53,591 --> 00:27:55,059
Are you reporting a Code Yellow?

602
00:27:55,127 --> 00:27:56,160
Affirmative.

603
00:27:56,228 --> 00:27:57,694
I have a confirmed visual

604
00:27:57,763 --> 00:27:59,130
on the target suspect

605
00:27:59,197 --> 00:28:00,530
with the canister.

606
00:28:00,598 --> 00:28:02,466
Repeat, confirmed visual

607
00:28:02,533 --> 00:28:04,301
of suspect and canister.

608
00:28:04,369 --> 00:28:06,703
Agent Park, may I?

609
00:28:06,772 --> 00:28:09,173
Agent Stoller,
this is Jack Bauer.

610
00:28:09,241 --> 00:28:12,076
Is Galvez with someone?

611
00:28:12,144 --> 00:28:13,343
Agent Stoller?

612
00:28:13,411 --> 00:28:15,545
Negative.
He's alone.

613
00:28:15,613 --> 00:28:17,481
(static crackles)

614
00:28:17,548 --> 00:28:18,715
Copy that.

615
00:28:18,784 --> 00:28:21,152
RENEE:
What's his 20?

616
00:28:21,219 --> 00:28:23,287
Entering an abandoned
apartment building

617
00:28:23,354 --> 00:28:24,822
on the south side

618
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:26,690
of Rincon and 12th.

619
00:28:26,758 --> 00:28:27,892
I am in pursuit.

620
00:28:27,959 --> 00:28:29,726
Try to maintain a visual
and wait for backup.

621
00:28:29,795 --> 00:28:31,195
Do not engage
until we get there.

622
00:28:31,263 --> 00:28:32,963
Copy that.

623
00:28:33,031 --> 00:28:35,766
PARK: All primary units
respond to 12th and Rincon.

624
00:28:35,834 --> 00:28:37,067
Suspect sighted entering

625
00:28:37,135 --> 00:28:38,402
a building with canister.

626
00:28:38,469 --> 00:28:40,437
Code Yellow.
Agent Park?
I want a secure net

627
00:28:40,505 --> 00:28:43,174
around the building,
agents at all exits and I want

628
00:28:43,241 --> 00:28:45,309
sharpshooters covering each of
the four exposures.

629
00:28:45,376 --> 00:28:47,377
PARK:
Yes, ma'am.

630
00:28:47,445 --> 00:28:48,712
Jack.

631
00:28:49,614 --> 00:28:51,415
I can't.

632
00:28:54,485 --> 00:28:57,087
It's all right, I'll be fine.

633
00:28:57,155 --> 00:28:58,789
I'll stay back,
I'll watch operations.

634
00:28:58,857 --> 00:29:00,724
You be careful out there.

635
00:29:00,792 --> 00:29:02,759
I still think Galvez
has a partner.

636
00:29:02,828 --> 00:29:04,829
You watch your back.

637
00:29:57,925 --> 00:29:59,727
"Hellfire."

638
00:29:59,794 --> 00:30:02,396
You served with the
27th in Pakistan.

639
00:30:02,464 --> 00:30:04,231
Two tours, sir.

640
00:30:04,298 --> 00:30:07,534
Did you, by any chance,
encounter any Starkwood units?

641
00:30:07,602 --> 00:30:08,300
(grunting)

642
00:30:08,363 --> 00:30:10,230
There was a force
protection team

643
00:30:10,298 --> 00:30:12,232
attached by my C.O.

644
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,367
They fought with you.

645
00:30:13,434 --> 00:30:15,235
Yes, sir.

646
00:30:15,303 --> 00:30:17,104
Side by side.

647
00:30:17,171 --> 00:30:18,205
Soldier...

648
00:30:20,141 --> 00:30:23,410
How would you rate
their professionalism?

649
00:30:23,477 --> 00:30:24,778
Their performance under fire.

650
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:32,252
Thank you, son.

651
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,787
Just made my day.

652
00:30:36,157 --> 00:30:38,691
(doors banging)

653
00:30:47,001 --> 00:30:49,369
(ignition turns)

654
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:54,207
All right, let's go.

655
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:05,385
Our orders are
to deliver the prisoner

656
00:31:05,453 --> 00:31:07,020
to the rear entrance at FBI.

657
00:31:08,489 --> 00:31:10,123
The White House wants
to keep this low-key.

658
00:31:45,259 --> 00:31:46,860
(raspy breathing)

659
00:31:46,927 --> 00:31:48,362
Sarge!

660
00:31:49,497 --> 00:31:51,264
(gasping)

661
00:31:51,332 --> 00:31:53,166
(tires squealing)

662
00:32:00,741 --> 00:32:02,376
This is Sergeant Cadden.

663
00:32:02,443 --> 00:32:05,479
Prisoner's in severe cardiac
and respiratory distress.

664
00:32:05,546 --> 00:32:07,114
We are rerouting

665
00:32:07,181 --> 00:32:09,616
to West Arlington Hospital.

666
00:32:09,683 --> 00:32:12,486
Need emergency
medical team standing by!

667
00:32:13,154 --> 00:32:14,187
Go, go!

668
00:32:15,423 --> 00:32:18,525
(sirens wailing)

669
00:32:27,435 --> 00:32:28,801
Assemble the teams.
You got it.

670
00:32:28,869 --> 00:32:30,770
Agent Stoller, this is
Agent Walker, do you copy?

671
00:32:30,838 --> 00:32:31,871
I copy you, Agent Walker.

672
00:32:31,939 --> 00:32:33,173
What is your position?

673
00:32:33,241 --> 00:32:36,576
East stairwell between
the first and second floor.

674
00:32:36,644 --> 00:32:37,810
Suspect with canister

675
00:32:37,878 --> 00:32:39,312
has moved to the top floor.

676
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:41,214
Do you have any indication
that he's not alone?

677
00:32:41,282 --> 00:32:42,749
Negative. Not at this time.

678
00:32:42,816 --> 00:32:44,551
All right, stand by.
We're coming to you.

679
00:32:44,618 --> 00:32:47,320
Agent Stoller puts the suspect
somewhere on the second floor.

680
00:32:47,388 --> 00:32:48,755
However, there's no guarantee

681
00:32:48,822 --> 00:32:50,657
that he's the only
hostile in the building.

682
00:32:50,724 --> 00:32:53,060
Therefore, we stick to SOP,
clearing room by room.

683
00:32:53,127 --> 00:32:54,894
Agent Park and I will lead
two teams, East and West.

684
00:32:54,962 --> 00:32:56,229
Check your weapons
and headsets.

685
00:32:56,297 --> 00:32:57,764
We move in 60 seconds.

686
00:32:57,831 --> 00:32:59,732
PARK:
All right, you heard her,
you guys are with me...

687
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:00,800
Mobile Command, this is Walker.

688
00:33:00,868 --> 00:33:02,202
MAN:
Go ahead, Agent Walker.

689
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:03,636
RENEE:
We're about
to enter the building.

690
00:33:03,704 --> 00:33:06,039
Have HazMat teams on alert, in
case the canister gets breached.

691
00:33:06,107 --> 00:33:07,374
MAN:
Copy that.

692
00:33:07,442 --> 00:33:08,508
How you holding up?

693
00:33:08,576 --> 00:33:09,776
Better, thanks.

694
00:33:17,085 --> 00:33:19,752
(phone rings)
Excuse me.

695
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:20,954
This is Bauer.

696
00:33:21,021 --> 00:33:22,956
Mr. Bauer,
this is Agent Mizelli.

697
00:33:23,023 --> 00:33:24,324
Sorry to bother
you with this,

698
00:33:24,392 --> 00:33:26,259
but I need to follow up on
something from our debrief.

699
00:33:26,327 --> 00:33:27,727
Agent, this isn't a good time.

700
00:33:27,795 --> 00:33:30,029
Some new information has come
to light, and I need

701
00:33:30,098 --> 00:33:32,265
to clear up a discrepancy.
What discrepancy?

702
00:33:32,333 --> 00:33:35,635
You told me Tony Almeida's
source on the White House attack

703
00:33:35,703 --> 00:33:38,238
was a man identified to you
as Vincent Cardiff?

704
00:33:38,306 --> 00:33:39,473
Yeah, that's right.

705
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:42,409
Is there a possibility
you misremembered the name?

706
00:33:42,477 --> 00:33:43,443
No, I don't think so.

707
00:33:43,511 --> 00:33:44,444
Are you sure?

708
00:33:44,512 --> 00:33:45,579
You yourself have voiced some

709
00:33:45,646 --> 00:33:46,713
concern about your own acuity.

710
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:48,448
Hold on.

711
00:33:48,516 --> 00:33:49,449
What is this here?

712
00:33:49,517 --> 00:33:50,617
Sir?

713
00:33:50,684 --> 00:33:51,818
Agent Mizelli, I'm
gonna have to get

714
00:33:51,885 --> 00:33:53,320
back to you.
Locator codes

715
00:33:53,387 --> 00:33:55,021
for all units'
radio transponders.

716
00:33:55,089 --> 00:33:56,556
Are they in real time?
Yes, sir.

717
00:33:56,624 --> 00:33:57,557
Can you do
a map overlay?

718
00:33:57,625 --> 00:33:58,658
It'll take a minute.
Get it done.

719
00:33:58,726 --> 00:34:00,727
What's going on, Jack?

720
00:34:00,794 --> 00:34:03,430
I'm not sure yet.

721
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,986
Ready?
Now.

722
00:34:27,054 --> 00:34:29,689
(grunts)

723
00:34:41,435 --> 00:34:42,636
(computer beeps)

724
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:48,141
Right there, there's
Stoller's transponder.

725
00:34:48,209 --> 00:34:49,842
He's not even
in the building.

726
00:34:49,910 --> 00:34:50,877
Agent Walker, this is Jack.

727
00:34:50,944 --> 00:34:52,279
Get your men out
of the building.

728
00:34:52,346 --> 00:34:53,780
It's a trap.
Jack, what?

729
00:34:53,847 --> 00:34:56,683
Stoller's not even in there.
Get your men out now.

730
00:34:56,750 --> 00:34:57,817
<i>RENEE:
Code Blue.</i>

731
00:34:57,885 --> 00:34:59,486
Repeat: Code Blue.

732
00:35:01,422 --> 00:35:01,988
(beeps)

733
00:35:13,634 --> 00:35:16,369
Agent Walker, Agent Park!

734
00:35:16,437 --> 00:35:17,571
Get us a vehicle now!

735
00:35:17,638 --> 00:35:19,138
All perimeter teams,
this is Park.

736
00:35:19,207 --> 00:35:21,974
Agents are down.
Report to 12th and Rincon.

737
00:35:22,042 --> 00:35:23,142
We need assistance.

738
00:35:23,211 --> 00:35:24,678
Negative, negative,
disregard that order.

739
00:35:24,745 --> 00:35:25,712
Maintain your
positions.

740
00:35:25,779 --> 00:35:27,314
I repeat, maintain
your positions.

741
00:35:27,381 --> 00:35:28,748
Bauer, what the hell
are you doing?

742
00:35:28,816 --> 00:35:30,483
They are trying to pull you
off the line.

743
00:35:30,551 --> 00:35:31,818
You leave a hole
in that perimeter,

744
00:35:31,885 --> 00:35:33,220
we are going
to lose the canister.

745
00:35:33,287 --> 00:35:34,521
Tell your men to stand fast.

746
00:35:34,589 --> 00:35:35,722
Medivac is on its way.

747
00:35:35,789 --> 00:35:37,290
Get them in the air now!

748
00:36:10,612 --> 00:36:13,025
Jack, I'm going in.

749
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:14,017
Agent Park.

750
00:36:14,085 --> 00:36:15,518
Agent Park.

751
00:36:15,586 --> 00:36:17,253
How many men
are unaccounted for?
Still assessing.

752
00:36:17,321 --> 00:36:18,989
There were at least 30
of us in the building

753
00:36:19,056 --> 00:36:20,790
when it went up.
And Agent Walker?

754
00:36:20,858 --> 00:36:22,926
I don't know.

755
00:36:22,994 --> 00:36:24,928
Renee, this is Jack.

756
00:36:24,996 --> 00:36:26,429
Do you copy?

757
00:36:26,497 --> 00:36:27,430
Renee, this is Jack.

758
00:36:27,498 --> 00:36:30,166
Do you copy?

759
00:36:30,234 --> 00:36:32,702
Damn it.

760
00:36:32,770 --> 00:36:35,705
(coughing)

761
00:36:38,776 --> 00:36:40,777
Almeida.

762
00:36:42,613 --> 00:36:44,547
You got the canister?

763
00:36:44,615 --> 00:36:45,548
Yeah.

764
00:36:45,616 --> 00:36:46,616
Let me see.

765
00:36:51,588 --> 00:36:53,957
Hurry up, we need
to get moving.

766
00:37:02,099 --> 00:37:04,634
Let's go.

767
00:37:04,702 --> 00:37:06,703
Renee!

768
00:37:14,444 --> 00:37:17,147
Renee...

769
00:37:17,214 --> 00:37:18,882
Renee!
Jack.

770
00:37:18,949 --> 00:37:21,718
Are you okay?

771
00:37:21,786 --> 00:37:23,753
Yeah, but he's
not breathing.

772
00:37:23,821 --> 00:37:24,921
We need a medic!

773
00:37:29,827 --> 00:37:32,228
They've got him.
I want to get you out of here.

774
00:37:32,296 --> 00:37:34,698
Come on, let's go now.

775
00:37:38,335 --> 00:37:40,603
(panting)

776
00:37:40,671 --> 00:37:42,138
How'd you know
it was a trap?

777
00:37:42,206 --> 00:37:44,540
Stoller's transponder was
outside of the building.

778
00:37:44,608 --> 00:37:46,776
They were trying to thin
our ranks, create a diversion.

779
00:37:46,844 --> 00:37:47,877
Has the cordon
been breached?

780
00:37:47,945 --> 00:37:49,612
No, I told the men
to maintain their positions.

781
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,714
The perimeter's secure.

782
00:37:50,781 --> 00:37:51,948
It's almost
like they knew, Jack.

783
00:37:52,016 --> 00:37:52,949
They would have needed time

784
00:37:53,017 --> 00:37:54,184
to wire this building
with explosives.

785
00:37:54,251 --> 00:37:56,152
This was the last sector
we were due to search.

786
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:59,388
You think they knew
your sweep patterns?
They must have.

787
00:38:00,424 --> 00:38:01,357
Oh, my God.

788
00:38:01,425 --> 00:38:02,491
Jack, what is it?

789
00:38:02,559 --> 00:38:05,995
I'll meet you back
at your vehicle.

790
00:38:07,364 --> 00:38:09,265
Hey, you want me
to take him?

791
00:38:09,333 --> 00:38:10,333
No, I got him.

792
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,702
They need your help inside.

793
00:38:18,042 --> 00:38:19,642
MIZELLI:
Agent Mizelli.

794
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:21,978
This is Bauer. You said you
wanted to talk to me

795
00:38:22,046 --> 00:38:24,047
about Tony's suspect
Vincent Cardiff.

796
00:38:24,115 --> 00:38:25,782
Yes, yes, thanks for
getting back to me.

797
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:27,617
Listen, uh, you told
me that he expired

798
00:38:27,684 --> 00:38:29,619
during the course of Tony
Almeida's interrogation.

799
00:38:29,686 --> 00:38:31,487
Yeah, that's what
Tony told me.

800
00:38:31,555 --> 00:38:32,688
Well, it
can't be him.

801
00:38:32,757 --> 00:38:33,790
What are you talking about?

802
00:38:33,858 --> 00:38:34,824
Vincent Cardiff was picked up

803
00:38:34,892 --> 00:38:36,159
over an hour ago by Customs,

804
00:38:36,227 --> 00:38:37,593
trying to cross
the border into Canada.

805
00:38:37,661 --> 00:38:39,162
Are you sure?

806
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:41,030
Look, I'm positive, I've got
his arrest report right here.

807
00:38:41,098 --> 00:38:42,698
Cardiff's alive.

808
00:38:42,767 --> 00:38:43,699
Were there any signs

809
00:38:43,768 --> 00:38:44,934
from his interrogation--

810
00:38:45,002 --> 00:38:46,602
physical violence,
abuse, anything at all?

811
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:47,871
Nothing's indicated
on the report.

812
00:38:47,938 --> 00:38:49,505
That's why I was asking if maybe

813
00:38:49,573 --> 00:38:51,307
you had mistaken
the name Almeida gave you.

814
00:38:51,375 --> 00:38:54,110
(panting)

815
00:38:59,483 --> 00:39:01,417
Here you go.

816
00:39:01,485 --> 00:39:02,986
Thanks.

817
00:39:03,053 --> 00:39:05,688
JACK:
Tony!

818
00:39:10,227 --> 00:39:11,261
Tony!

819
00:39:11,328 --> 00:39:13,029
(taps twice)

820
00:39:13,097 --> 00:39:14,563
Yeah.

821
00:39:17,768 --> 00:39:19,502
We need to talk.

822
00:39:19,569 --> 00:39:20,870
Sure.

823
00:39:21,906 --> 00:39:24,274
What's going on?

824
00:39:27,477 --> 00:39:29,779
I told you earlier today,

825
00:39:29,847 --> 00:39:31,848
if you were lying to me
I'd kill you myself.

826
00:39:31,916 --> 00:39:33,883
What the hell
are you talking about?

827
00:39:33,951 --> 00:39:35,518
Cardiff, Vincent Cardiff--

828
00:39:35,585 --> 00:39:37,153
you said he was killed
during his interrogation.

829
00:39:37,221 --> 00:39:38,188
Yeah, so?

830
00:39:38,255 --> 00:39:40,589
He's alive and well, in custody,

831
00:39:40,657 --> 00:39:42,658
and he's showing no signs
of physical abuse.

832
00:39:42,726 --> 00:39:43,793
Explain that.

833
00:39:43,861 --> 00:39:47,931
All right, look,
Jack, I'm sorry.

834
00:39:47,998 --> 00:39:49,732
Cardiff knew
that by spilling that intel,

835
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,367
he was going
to get himself killed,

836
00:39:51,435 --> 00:39:52,802
so I cut a
deal with him.

837
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:55,038
I told him I'd
let the FBI think

838
00:39:55,105 --> 00:39:57,673
he was dead, so he could
walk away and disappear.

839
00:39:57,741 --> 00:39:59,309
I thought it was just
a meaningless lie.

840
00:39:59,376 --> 00:40:01,577
You and I have been doing this
long enough to know

841
00:40:01,645 --> 00:40:03,813
that there is no
such thing as a meaningless lie.

842
00:40:03,881 --> 00:40:04,981
How are you involved
in this?

843
00:40:05,049 --> 00:40:06,216
You're not making
any sense, Jack.

844
00:40:06,283 --> 00:40:07,616
That intel was good.

845
00:40:07,684 --> 00:40:09,152
Without it you'd have never
been in the White House

846
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:10,153
to save the president.

847
00:40:10,221 --> 00:40:11,487
What is your involvement?!

848
00:40:12,589 --> 00:40:14,590
You're not thinking straight.

849
00:40:14,658 --> 00:40:16,659
How were you shot?

850
00:40:16,727 --> 00:40:19,262
Does Galvez even have
a second man...

851
00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:20,629
or was it just you?

852
00:40:20,697 --> 00:40:22,265
Just stop and listen
to what you're saying.

853
00:40:22,333 --> 00:40:24,234
It's insane. It's paranoia.

854
00:40:24,301 --> 00:40:26,069
Now, why don't you put
the gun down?

855
00:40:26,136 --> 00:40:28,637
Don't you move!
(grunting)

856
00:40:28,705 --> 00:40:31,074
The toxin is starting
to affect your judgment.

857
00:40:31,141 --> 00:40:33,676
That's what's happening.
You can see that, right?

858
00:40:35,512 --> 00:40:37,480
(grunting)

859
00:40:51,595 --> 00:40:54,030
Is this what you're looking for?

860
00:40:55,032 --> 00:40:56,665
(garbled breaths)

861
00:40:56,733 --> 00:40:58,935
I never wanted
to hurt you, Jack.

862
00:40:59,003 --> 00:41:00,336
(choked rasping)

863
00:41:00,404 --> 00:41:02,171
I told you to stay out of it.

864
00:41:02,239 --> 00:41:04,007
But you wouldn't listen,
would you?

865
00:41:04,074 --> 00:41:07,643
Can we get some help here?
This man's having a seizure.

866
00:41:07,711 --> 00:41:11,381
Stand back, please.

867
00:41:11,448 --> 00:41:13,682
Go get my bag
and call Dr. Mason, stat.

868
00:41:14,851 --> 00:41:17,553
(choked rasping)

869
00:41:44,248 --> 00:41:46,916
(siren wailing)

870
00:41:52,222 --> 00:41:54,357
I don't see anything.

871
00:41:54,425 --> 00:41:55,391
The wound must be posterior.

872
00:41:55,459 --> 00:41:58,361
Sir, I need to turn you
on your side.

873
00:42:05,469 --> 00:42:06,869
(clattering)

874
00:42:08,038 --> 00:42:11,240
Put it down and
keep driving. Now!
