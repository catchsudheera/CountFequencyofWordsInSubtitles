1
00:00:14,533 --> 00:00:17,445
- Did you check the passport information?
- I did.

2
00:00:17,533 --> 00:00:20,570
It confirms Reza Naiyeer
has had contact with Syed Ali.

3
00:00:20,653 --> 00:00:23,531
My sister is marrying
someone who works for terrorists

4
00:00:23,613 --> 00:00:25,205
and you expect me to act normal?

5
00:00:25,293 --> 00:00:29,172
You could endanger yourself and your family
if you let on anything is wrong.

6
00:00:29,253 --> 00:00:30,322
I understand.

7
00:00:31,213 --> 00:00:35,092
George, we need you to check out
a warehouse in the valley.

8
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:42,285
The substance you inhaled is plutonium.

9
00:00:42,373 --> 00:00:47,083
- How much time do I have?
- As much as a week or as little as a day.

10
00:00:47,573 --> 00:00:49,052
What's going on?

11
00:00:49,133 --> 00:00:52,682
Jack Bauer says that Wald's crew
is planning to blow up CTU.

12
00:00:52,773 --> 00:00:56,243
- Have you contacted CTU?
- Bauer hasn't gotten to Wald yet.

13
00:00:56,333 --> 00:01:00,167
If we stop Wald's crew,
they may realise Bauer turned them in.

14
00:01:00,253 --> 00:01:02,209
Contact CTU immediately.

15
00:01:02,613 --> 00:01:04,331
I won't let him hurt you again.

16
00:01:04,413 --> 00:01:07,007
- You're reporting a child abduction?
- My daughter.

17
00:01:07,093 --> 00:01:09,527
- Describe the suspect.
- Her name's Kimberly Bauer.

18
00:01:09,613 --> 00:01:12,047
It's kinda messed up.
I have the police after me.

19
00:01:12,133 --> 00:01:14,966
- Can you get to CTU?
- Yeah, I guess so.

20
00:01:15,373 --> 00:01:18,206
My name's Kimberly Bauer.
Tony Almeida is expecting us.

21
00:01:18,293 --> 00:01:20,966
You think you'll take that building down
with three charges?

22
00:01:21,053 --> 00:01:24,443
- What made you target CTU anyway?
- Why so many questions?

23
00:01:31,053 --> 00:01:36,252
- We did it, Jack.
- Good job, Eddie. Good job.

24
00:01:54,213 --> 00:01:56,807
The walls are coming down.

25
00:01:59,093 --> 00:02:01,971
We have seven DOAs in the alpha zone.
What's your count?

26
00:02:02,053 --> 00:02:04,044
Ten so far.

27
00:02:07,453 --> 00:02:10,047
Fire and rescue teams are en route.

28
00:02:34,813 --> 00:02:36,804
Tony...

29
00:02:37,453 --> 00:02:39,444
Tony?

30
00:02:43,373 --> 00:02:46,809
Can we get some help over here? A little help.

31
00:02:46,893 --> 00:02:48,167
Tony!

32
00:02:49,133 --> 00:02:50,691
Michelle!

33
00:02:52,053 --> 00:02:55,170
I need you to set up a triage.
Take Luke with you.

34
00:02:56,533 --> 00:02:59,525
Luke, I've got you. It's Michelle.

35
00:02:59,613 --> 00:03:00,728
Let me see that.

36
00:03:00,813 --> 00:03:02,929
Paula? Paula, can you hear me?

37
00:03:03,773 --> 00:03:04,922
What happened?

38
00:03:05,013 --> 00:03:09,245
You don't have to speak.
Just blink your eyes if you can hear me.

39
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:12,848
We're gonna get you outta there.
Just hang tight. All right?

40
00:03:13,853 --> 00:03:18,210
She's bad, man. We gotta get a crane
or a hydraulic lift in here.

41
00:03:18,293 --> 00:03:21,888
We have to be careful. If we pull out
the wrong piece, it could come down on her.

42
00:03:21,973 --> 00:03:24,407
We have to do this brick by brick.

43
00:03:24,493 --> 00:03:27,326
That could take for ever.

44
00:03:27,413 --> 00:03:29,404
All right, let's do it.

45
00:03:32,533 --> 00:03:37,971
It's OK. We're gonna be all right.
You're being real brave. Real...

46
00:03:38,053 --> 00:03:40,283
- Ssh, ssh, come on.
- I don't feel very well.

47
00:03:40,373 --> 00:03:44,332
We're gonna be OK. We're gonna
be out of here soon, OK? All right?

48
00:03:45,133 --> 00:03:47,124
Megan! Megan!

49
00:03:48,173 --> 00:03:51,370
Somebody help me! Please, I need some help!

50
00:03:51,453 --> 00:03:53,967
- Hold her down.
- What's wrong with her?

51
00:03:54,053 --> 00:03:55,372
What's the matter?

52
00:03:55,453 --> 00:03:57,409
Megan!

53
00:03:57,493 --> 00:03:59,643
- Megan!
- She's seizing.

54
00:03:59,733 --> 00:04:04,329
- We've gotta get her to the ER right away.
- What's wrong with her?

55
00:04:04,933 --> 00:04:09,085
Sir, we did everything we could do.

56
00:04:09,173 --> 00:04:14,770
If only Bauer had called earlier, even a few
minutes, we could've saved those people.

57
00:04:14,853 --> 00:04:19,529
Until we know more, I'd like to go over
my evacuation plan for LA. It's on your desk.

58
00:04:19,613 --> 00:04:23,572
- I'll call you when I'm ready to meet on it.
- Thank you, sir.

59
00:04:30,893 --> 00:04:33,407
Those people are dead because of you.

60
00:04:33,493 --> 00:04:36,405
- I wanted to tell the president.
- But you didn't.

61
00:04:36,493 --> 00:04:40,805
Because of you, Eric.
You made sure I couldn't get through to him.

62
00:04:40,893 --> 00:04:45,125
As far as I know, Bauer never called.
You're the one who spoke to him.

63
00:04:45,213 --> 00:04:48,888
- Are you blackmailing me?
- I'm protecting the president.

64
00:04:48,973 --> 00:04:54,252
Lynne, whatever you know or think you know,
I suggest you keep it to yourself.

65
00:05:06,573 --> 00:05:10,361
Everything in your car, I had it cleared out
and put into the ambulance.

66
00:05:10,453 --> 00:05:13,331
So whenever you're ready
to go to the hospital.

67
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:16,291
- So how's it gonna happen?
- Excuse me?

68
00:05:16,373 --> 00:05:18,250
You said I might be dead by tomorrow.

69
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:22,770
I'm curious to know what to expect
for the rest of the day.

70
00:05:22,853 --> 00:05:26,812
Uh... There's a latent period
where you'll be mostly asymptomatic.

71
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:31,648
Even in the most extreme cases
of radiation poisoning, it can last a while.

72
00:05:31,733 --> 00:05:33,325
What's a while?

73
00:05:33,413 --> 00:05:36,530
Uh... up to 12 hours, maybe longer.

74
00:05:36,613 --> 00:05:39,286
How do you feel now?

75
00:05:39,373 --> 00:05:40,567
I wanna puke.

76
00:05:40,653 --> 00:05:43,611
I can give you something
to control the nausea.

77
00:05:43,693 --> 00:05:44,808
Thanks, yeah.

78
00:05:44,893 --> 00:05:48,044
At least until the symptoms are more acute.

79
00:05:48,133 --> 00:05:50,124
Yeah, like what?

80
00:05:51,613 --> 00:05:54,366
Your hair will start to fall out.

81
00:05:54,453 --> 00:05:56,205
I'm used to that.

82
00:05:56,293 --> 00:06:00,650
You'll start to manifest
gastrointestinal haemorrhaging,

83
00:06:00,733 --> 00:06:03,930
skin lesions,
bleeding from the mouth and the nose.

84
00:06:05,653 --> 00:06:06,802
OK.

85
00:06:06,893 --> 00:06:09,453
So how am I gonna die?

86
00:06:09,533 --> 00:06:11,171
Um...

87
00:06:11,253 --> 00:06:17,408
Your mental functioning will begin to
deteriorate and then you'll lapse into a coma...

88
00:06:17,493 --> 00:06:18,482
Mr Mason.

89
00:06:18,573 --> 00:06:20,211
- Not now.
- It's Tony Almeida.

90
00:06:20,293 --> 00:06:21,851
- Not now!
- He said it's urgent.

91
00:06:21,933 --> 00:06:23,764
It's OK.

92
00:06:24,493 --> 00:06:28,611
- Tony, what is it?
- They hit us, George. They bombed CTU.

93
00:06:28,693 --> 00:06:30,285
What kind of damage?

94
00:06:30,373 --> 00:06:33,410
Damage reports are still coming in
but so far we got 19 dead,

95
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:36,451
20 wounded and seven missing.

96
00:06:36,533 --> 00:06:41,243
We're bleeding bad here, George.
All of our intel on the nuke was destroyed.

97
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:46,726
It's on the NSA server but Paula wrote
the decryption code and she's in bad shape.

98
00:06:46,813 --> 00:06:51,329
- Do whatever you have to to retrieve it.
- That's why I called you.

99
00:06:51,413 --> 00:06:55,008
- Chain of command, remember?
- Call NSA systems people. Get them on it.

100
00:06:55,093 --> 00:06:57,368
- I already did, George.
- Good.

101
00:06:57,453 --> 00:06:59,489
When are you coming back here?

102
00:06:59,573 --> 00:07:01,211
I'm not sure.

103
00:07:01,293 --> 00:07:03,807
Well, the sooner the better.

104
00:07:03,893 --> 00:07:06,885
Look, the truth is I may not be coming back.

105
00:07:06,973 --> 00:07:10,568
- Why not?
- I'm not in a position to help out right now.

106
00:07:10,653 --> 00:07:15,647
What are you talking about? Look, a nuclear
device is set to go off some time today in LA.

107
00:07:15,733 --> 00:07:20,443
We lost half the people who could've stopped
it, so stop trying to cover your own ass!

108
00:07:20,533 --> 00:07:23,923
Just deal with it, Tony, OK?
Just deal with it, all right?

109
00:07:24,013 --> 00:07:26,049
Yeah, right.

110
00:07:44,813 --> 00:07:47,202
Jack, you come with me.

111
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:53,329
All right, light her up. Let's get outta here.

112
00:07:57,973 --> 00:08:00,248
Hey, Joe. It's done.

113
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:02,289
No. Nothing.

114
00:08:03,093 --> 00:08:06,085
Yeah. Yeah, I can do it.

115
00:08:06,173 --> 00:08:08,164
Give me the address.

116
00:08:11,093 --> 00:08:13,084
Yeah, I know where it is.

117
00:08:14,653 --> 00:08:16,644
All right.

118
00:08:18,853 --> 00:08:20,206
All right. Out.

119
00:08:21,493 --> 00:08:24,371
- Was that Joe?
- Yeah. Let's go.

120
00:08:28,453 --> 00:08:32,412
- Give me the matchbook, Eddie.
- What the hell are you doing, Jack?

121
00:08:32,493 --> 00:08:37,089
I'm a federal officer. You're under arrest.
Now give me the matchbook.

122
00:08:38,573 --> 00:08:41,690
You helped plant those bombs
and cut Goren's head off.

123
00:08:41,773 --> 00:08:45,891
I know what I did, Eddie.
Put your right hand on the steering wheel.

124
00:08:50,373 --> 00:08:53,888
And very slowly,
with your left hand, pass me your gun.

125
00:08:56,853 --> 00:09:01,563
You know, Jack, when Joe finds out
about this, you're a dead man.

126
00:09:01,653 --> 00:09:03,689
Shut up, Eddie. Get out of the car.

127
00:09:06,133 --> 00:09:07,282
That son of a bitch.

128
00:10:29,013 --> 00:10:30,492
Tony Almeida's line.

129
00:10:30,573 --> 00:10:32,803
- Who's this?
- Michelle Dressler.

130
00:10:32,893 --> 00:10:35,532
This is Jack Bauer. What's going on?

131
00:10:35,613 --> 00:10:40,448
There was an explosion 20 minutes ago.
21 casualties, the number's growing.

132
00:10:40,533 --> 00:10:43,605
- Why wasn't CTU evacuated?
- There wasn't any time.

133
00:10:43,693 --> 00:10:47,402
What do you mean there wasn't enough time?
Is Mason all right?

134
00:10:47,493 --> 00:10:48,642
He wasn't here.

135
00:10:48,733 --> 00:10:52,487
- How about Tony Almeida?
- He's helping the rescue workers.

136
00:10:52,573 --> 00:10:56,168
- Fine. Can you handle a situation report?
- Yeah.

137
00:10:59,613 --> 00:11:00,523
OK, go ahead.

138
00:11:00,613 --> 00:11:03,685
I've located Joseph Wald.
I'm on my way there now.

139
00:11:03,773 --> 00:11:06,287
- What about Wald's crew?
- They're all dead.

140
00:11:06,373 --> 00:11:07,169
Dead?

141
00:11:07,253 --> 00:11:09,813
Just let Mason know
I'm on my way to Wald's house.

142
00:11:09,893 --> 00:11:14,171
The address is 221 Canyon View Road
in Simi Valley.

143
00:11:14,253 --> 00:11:15,652
OK, III send backup.

144
00:11:15,733 --> 00:11:20,853
OK. Oh, Michelle, let Mason know
I talked to Kim. She is leaving the city.

145
00:11:20,933 --> 00:11:24,926
- She called here too and she spoke to Tony.
- She did? What did she say?

146
00:11:25,013 --> 00:11:29,211
- I'm not sure. But I'll look into it.
- OK, get back to me. Thanks.

147
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:35,324
Paula! Paula!

148
00:11:35,733 --> 00:11:37,564
Is she OK?

149
00:11:37,653 --> 00:11:39,564
Tony!

150
00:11:40,893 --> 00:11:42,292
What's up?

151
00:11:42,373 --> 00:11:45,012
- Just got off the phone with Jack Bauer.
- Where is he?

152
00:11:45,093 --> 00:11:47,448
On his way to see Wald.
He wanted Mason to know.

153
00:11:47,533 --> 00:11:51,970
Well, Mason's checked out.
Just get the information directly to NSA.

154
00:11:52,053 --> 00:11:54,567
And he asked about his daughter, Kim.

155
00:11:54,653 --> 00:11:57,167
- Oh... Oh, no.
- What?

156
00:11:57,253 --> 00:12:02,646
She was on her way here. Can you check the
security logs, see if she was in the building?

157
00:12:02,733 --> 00:12:04,724
Thanks.

158
00:12:07,173 --> 00:12:08,765
- Is Megan all right?
- She will be.

159
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:13,563
Her seizure was caused by pressure
on the brain compounded by a skull fracture.

160
00:12:13,653 --> 00:12:15,848
But she wasn't injured in the explosion.

161
00:12:15,933 --> 00:12:21,849
I know. From what I've seen, her head injury
most likely occurred before the blast.

162
00:12:22,573 --> 00:12:27,601
She's had prior injuries - a fractured wrist,
several fingers that were never treated.

163
00:12:27,693 --> 00:12:28,762
What are you saying?

164
00:12:28,853 --> 00:12:33,165
These injuries suggest
a possible pattern of physical abuse.

165
00:12:37,973 --> 00:12:41,409
You don't think I did this?
You don't think I hurt her?

166
00:12:41,973 --> 00:12:45,363
I'm gonna let the police sort that out.

167
00:12:47,733 --> 00:12:52,045
Bill, they're limiting access.
All we know is that a short time ago,

168
00:12:52,133 --> 00:12:56,251
a major explosion ripped through
this government building in Los Angeles.

169
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:59,450
No statement has been issued
about the cause of the explosion,

170
00:12:59,533 --> 00:13:04,004
although early speculation has included
rumours of terrorist involvement.

171
00:13:04,093 --> 00:13:07,688
As far as I'm concerned,
this tips in favour of evacuation.

172
00:13:07,773 --> 00:13:11,971
I assume you've all read Eric's report
recommending the evacuation of LA.

173
00:13:12,053 --> 00:13:14,089
The CTU bombing is just the beginning.

174
00:13:14,173 --> 00:13:17,449
It's only a matter of time
before the questions become rumours,

175
00:13:17,533 --> 00:13:19,888
and the rumours set off a mass panic.

176
00:13:19,973 --> 00:13:22,567
Wouldn't the evacuation itself cause panic?

177
00:13:22,653 --> 00:13:26,248
We can do this discreetly.
We've prepared cover stories.

178
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:29,086
That's a tough sell for nine million people.

179
00:13:29,173 --> 00:13:33,644
General Preston assures me that
the military can contain any civilian unrest.

180
00:13:33,733 --> 00:13:37,931
"Contain" sounds like a euphemism.
Not to mention the Constitutional issues.

181
00:13:38,013 --> 00:13:41,050
I don't claim this'll be a cakewalk.

182
00:13:42,053 --> 00:13:45,409
There's also a practical issue
not being addressed here.

183
00:13:45,493 --> 00:13:46,721
What's that, Lynne?

184
00:13:46,813 --> 00:13:51,568
Our intelligence is specific about
this nuclear device being detonated today.

185
00:13:51,653 --> 00:13:55,487
Your report says it would take
at least one week for this evacuation.

186
00:13:55,573 --> 00:13:59,407
It's my job to protect as many
citizens of the United States as I can.

187
00:13:59,493 --> 00:14:03,532
If I get even 20%of the population
outside the blast radius, that's a win.

188
00:14:03,613 --> 00:14:07,083
We don't know where the bomb is.
Where do we begin the evacuation?

189
00:14:07,173 --> 00:14:10,449
My staff has ranked
ten high probability target areas.

190
00:14:10,533 --> 00:14:13,127
That's not good enough.

191
00:14:16,813 --> 00:14:20,852
Look, I realise you've only had
a short time to prepare this,

192
00:14:20,933 --> 00:14:23,925
but I have some real reservations.

193
00:14:24,013 --> 00:14:29,167
Bottom line, Mr President, it protects you
politically. If the bomb goes off...

194
00:14:29,253 --> 00:14:34,452
If the bomb goes off, we'll have more
important concerns than my re-election.

195
00:14:40,693 --> 00:14:43,287
Do you have anything else to add?

196
00:14:44,173 --> 00:14:44,969
No, sir.

197
00:14:45,053 --> 00:14:49,604
Then we're done. Until we have reliable
intelligence about where the bomb is located,

198
00:14:49,693 --> 00:14:51,684
there will be no evacuation.

199
00:14:53,653 --> 00:14:58,124
Let General Davenlos know I'm ready for him,
and conference in Ted and Elyse.

200
00:14:58,213 --> 00:14:59,612
Yes, sir.

201
00:15:08,413 --> 00:15:11,405
This is Jack Bauer.
I need to speak to the president urgently.

202
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:14,883
One moment please, Mr Bauer.

203
00:15:14,973 --> 00:15:18,682
I need you to confirm these reports
and get them on Novick's desk.

204
00:15:18,773 --> 00:15:21,446
- Lynne Kresge.
- I have Jack Bauer on line eight.

205
00:15:21,533 --> 00:15:25,970
- He insists on speaking to the president.
- Put him through, please.

206
00:15:26,813 --> 00:15:30,362
- Mr Bauer, this is Lynne Kresge.
- I asked to speak to the president.

207
00:15:30,453 --> 00:15:33,604
I'm sorry, he's unavailable.
Perhaps I can help.

208
00:15:33,693 --> 00:15:35,490
What the hell are you doing?

209
00:15:35,573 --> 00:15:38,804
I gave you a 30-minute warning
before that building was hit.

210
00:15:38,893 --> 00:15:41,009
You had time to evacuate.

211
00:15:41,093 --> 00:15:43,732
There were extenuating circumstances.

212
00:15:43,813 --> 00:15:45,963
I did try to tell the president.

213
00:15:46,053 --> 00:15:48,965
It's more complicated
than I'm able to explain at this time.

214
00:15:49,053 --> 00:15:52,329
- That's not good enough.
- It's all I can offer you.

215
00:15:52,413 --> 00:15:54,483
- Ms Kresge, right?
- Yes.

216
00:15:54,573 --> 00:15:58,566
You're responsible
for killing innocent people. Friends of mine.

217
00:15:58,653 --> 00:16:03,090
Right now you are the best chance we have
of intercepting that nuclear weapon.

218
00:16:03,173 --> 00:16:06,643
- So I suggest you do your job.
- I'll do my job.

219
00:16:06,733 --> 00:16:09,691
You people better start doing yours.

220
00:16:19,093 --> 00:16:20,572
Dad?

221
00:16:20,653 --> 00:16:25,408
- I need to talk to you. It's important.
- Sure. Sure, honey. Just a second.

222
00:16:27,373 --> 00:16:30,012
This wedding's gonna break me.

223
00:16:30,093 --> 00:16:33,369
So, what's the big emergency?

224
00:16:34,573 --> 00:16:40,091
Last month I was going over the P and Ls
and I found some inconsistencies.

225
00:16:40,173 --> 00:16:43,131
If this is business,
we'll deal with this on Monday.

226
00:16:43,213 --> 00:16:46,728
- Dad, it's about Reza.
- What about Reza?

227
00:16:48,853 --> 00:16:52,050
I thought he might have been
responsible for the missing money

228
00:16:52,133 --> 00:16:54,886
so I hired an investigator to do an audit.

229
00:16:54,973 --> 00:16:59,569
- You hired someone to spy on Reza?
- I thought he was stealing from you.

230
00:16:59,653 --> 00:17:01,962
And is he?

231
00:17:02,053 --> 00:17:07,525
No. But something else came up.
Something a lot worse.

232
00:17:09,013 --> 00:17:10,002
Come on.

233
00:17:16,293 --> 00:17:19,046
Reza may be involved with a terrorist.

234
00:17:19,133 --> 00:17:20,327
What?

235
00:17:20,413 --> 00:17:25,692
Apparently he's been in contact with
someone who finances terrorist operations.

236
00:17:25,773 --> 00:17:27,604
A man named Syed Ali.

237
00:17:27,693 --> 00:17:30,685
- What kind of proof does he have?
- I'm not sure.

238
00:17:30,773 --> 00:17:32,001
You're not sure?

239
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:38,328
He only called me an hour ago. He told me
not to tell anyone, but I had to tell you.

240
00:17:38,413 --> 00:17:42,201
Whatever this investigator found,
there's an explanation for it.

241
00:17:42,293 --> 00:17:45,330
You hire a man to dig up dirt,
he's gonna dig up dirt.

242
00:17:45,413 --> 00:17:47,927
That's how these guys stay in business.

243
00:17:48,013 --> 00:17:49,890
- What if you're wrong?
- I'm not.

244
00:17:49,973 --> 00:17:51,964
How do you know?

245
00:17:55,373 --> 00:17:58,683
Because I had Reza checked out myself.

246
00:17:58,773 --> 00:18:01,810
And a lot more thoroughly
than the guy you hired.

247
00:18:01,893 --> 00:18:04,566
Kate, Reza is not a terrorist.

248
00:18:06,653 --> 00:18:10,328
Look, I am a businessman, Kate.
A damn good one.

249
00:18:10,413 --> 00:18:13,485
My daughters are my most precious assets.

250
00:18:13,573 --> 00:18:19,170
I wouldn't let either one of you get married
without performing a due diligence.

251
00:18:19,253 --> 00:18:24,566
Now, I want you to drop this nonsense and
start treating him like a member of the family.

252
00:18:24,653 --> 00:18:26,848
- Hey, guys.
- Hey!

253
00:18:28,453 --> 00:18:32,651
I think my cousin's
got a little crush on you, Kate.

254
00:18:32,733 --> 00:18:35,327
He wouldn't stop talking about you.

255
00:18:35,413 --> 00:18:37,802
- He seems nice.
- Yeah, he is.

256
00:18:37,893 --> 00:18:42,250
Well, I promised Marie I'd pick up lunch.
I'd better get going.

257
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:45,370
- Let me take you.
- It's OK, I can handle it.

258
00:18:45,453 --> 00:18:48,968
When you see how much she's ordered,
you'll need another pair of hands.

259
00:18:49,053 --> 00:18:50,691
Really, I can do it.

260
00:18:51,413 --> 00:18:52,687
Kate...

261
00:18:53,813 --> 00:18:55,690
Go.

262
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:29,484
Mobile 3, this is Dispatch.

263
00:19:31,373 --> 00:19:32,852
This is mobile 3.

264
00:19:32,933 --> 00:19:36,084
I have Tony Almeida at CTU
for George Mason.

265
00:19:37,373 --> 00:19:39,682
- Sir...
- Yeah, I heard.

266
00:19:44,733 --> 00:19:46,291
- Tony?
- George.

267
00:19:46,373 --> 00:19:48,250
I told you to handle this yourself.

268
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:50,722
If I didn't have to talk to you again
I'd be happy.

269
00:19:50,813 --> 00:19:54,089
But IT need to access the data stream
Paula was working on.

270
00:19:54,173 --> 00:19:56,050
It's on your system. We need your password.

271
00:19:56,133 --> 00:19:58,124
- My password?
- Yeah.

272
00:19:59,533 --> 00:20:00,682
Hendrix.

273
00:20:00,773 --> 00:20:04,049
- That's with an "X"?
- How else would you spell it?

274
00:20:04,133 --> 00:20:05,532
Right. Thanks, George.

275
00:20:05,613 --> 00:20:09,049
- Tony?
- What?

276
00:20:10,213 --> 00:20:11,282
How's Paula doing?

277
00:20:11,453 --> 00:20:14,843
Not good. They're trying to dig her out,
but she's unresponsive.

278
00:20:14,933 --> 00:20:16,924
Look, I gotta go.

279
00:20:17,013 --> 00:20:18,207
OK.

280
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:23,489
Thank you.

281
00:20:29,053 --> 00:20:31,044
Am I contagious?

282
00:20:31,693 --> 00:20:33,684
No.

283
00:21:30,373 --> 00:21:32,762
Joe, it's Jack. Let me in.

284
00:21:34,613 --> 00:21:37,047
- Where's Eddie?
- He's dead.

285
00:21:37,133 --> 00:21:41,604
- What about Chris and Scott?
- They're dead, too. Let me in.

286
00:21:44,613 --> 00:21:49,084
- I talked to Eddie half an hour ago.
- Joe, we gotta do this inside. Let me in.

287
00:21:56,173 --> 00:21:59,688
Eddie said the job went off without a hitch.
What happened between then and now?

288
00:21:59,773 --> 00:22:02,048
I killed them, for resisting arrest.

289
00:22:02,133 --> 00:22:05,921
I'll kill you, too, Joe.
I mean it. Put it down on the table.

290
00:22:06,573 --> 00:22:09,041
Put it down! On the table, now.

291
00:22:12,653 --> 00:22:14,644
Have a seat on the couch.

292
00:22:20,053 --> 00:22:22,123
You killed Goren.

293
00:22:22,213 --> 00:22:24,408
I did what I had to to find you.

294
00:22:24,493 --> 00:22:27,326
Come on, Jack. What do you want?

295
00:22:27,413 --> 00:22:30,371
Who told you to hit CTU today?

296
00:22:30,453 --> 00:22:32,683
What makes you think anyone told me?

297
00:22:32,773 --> 00:22:38,052
Because there's a nuclear device somewhere
in Los Angeles set to go off today.

298
00:22:38,133 --> 00:22:40,283
That's right, Joe.

299
00:22:40,373 --> 00:22:44,810
CTU was a secondary target. A way
of stopping us from getting to the bomb.

300
00:22:44,893 --> 00:22:47,771
Whoever got you to do this job,
they used you, set you up.

301
00:22:47,853 --> 00:22:51,812
- You're lying, Jack.
- No, this time I'm telling you the truth.

302
00:22:51,893 --> 00:22:54,566
How else do you think I got to Goren?

303
00:22:54,653 --> 00:22:57,963
Come on, you're not stupid. Think about it.

304
00:22:58,053 --> 00:23:03,446
Why did you hit CTU today? Of all the days
you could have, why did you hit CTU today?

305
00:23:04,933 --> 00:23:09,723
You weren't just told where to hit,
you were told when. That's the truth, Joe.

306
00:23:09,813 --> 00:23:15,206
So, I'm gonna give you one last chance.
Who told you to hit CTU today?

307
00:24:11,773 --> 00:24:13,764
Open the door, Joe.

308
00:24:15,253 --> 00:24:17,244
Open the door.

309
00:24:20,773 --> 00:24:23,003
Open the door!

310
00:24:31,813 --> 00:24:34,611
There's no other way outta here, Joe.

311
00:25:04,773 --> 00:25:06,491
- Hello?
- Carla.

312
00:25:06,573 --> 00:25:08,928
- Kim, where are you?
- The emergency room.

313
00:25:10,493 --> 00:25:12,802
- Where's Megan?
- She's with the doctors.

314
00:25:12,893 --> 00:25:16,124
- Oh, my God, what happened?
- She collapsed, started shaking.

315
00:25:16,213 --> 00:25:20,172
The doctors said she had a seizure
because of pressure on her brain.

316
00:25:20,253 --> 00:25:22,403
Where are you? What hospital?

317
00:25:22,493 --> 00:25:23,846
First listen to me.

318
00:25:23,933 --> 00:25:27,448
No, you listen. You kidnapped my daughter
and attacked my husband.

319
00:25:27,533 --> 00:25:31,242
You know that’s not true.
It's Gary's fault that Megan is here.

320
00:25:31,333 --> 00:25:34,086
The doctor said she had a seizure
because of a head injury.

321
00:25:34,173 --> 00:25:38,291
- Gary threw her down and she hit her head.
- It was an accident, Kim.

322
00:25:38,373 --> 00:25:41,206
Stop making excuses for him,
denying what's happening.

323
00:25:41,293 --> 00:25:43,329
This isn’t your problem, Kim.

324
00:25:43,413 --> 00:25:49,010
They found other things on Megan's x-rays.
They think she's been abused. I think so, too.

325
00:25:53,053 --> 00:25:55,442
Carla, are you there?

326
00:25:56,893 --> 00:25:58,008
Yeah, I'm here.

327
00:25:58,093 --> 00:26:03,690
The hospital called the police. They're on their
way. You should be here when they come.

328
00:26:04,613 --> 00:26:07,685
- Where are you?
- St Virgil's Emergency Room.

329
00:26:07,773 --> 00:26:09,764
I'm 20 minutes away.

330
00:26:50,493 --> 00:26:55,487
A tactical team's on its way, Joe.
There's nowhere for you to go.

331
00:26:59,933 --> 00:27:05,326
The people who gave you the information
for CTU, the schematic, all the access codes,

332
00:27:06,893 --> 00:27:09,771
I want you to know what they're trying to do.

333
00:27:09,853 --> 00:27:13,448
They wanna destroy this entire country,
starting with LA.

334
00:27:13,533 --> 00:27:16,127
Is that really what you want, Joe?

335
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:24,249
I thought you wanted
to give the power back to the people.

336
00:27:24,333 --> 00:27:30,442
Isn't that what you used to say? Who do
you think's gonna be at ground zero, Joe?

337
00:27:30,533 --> 00:27:35,846
You're not fighting the federal government.
We're talking about innocent people.

338
00:27:35,933 --> 00:27:39,289
How many of them
are gonna have to die for you today?

339
00:27:39,373 --> 00:27:44,731
A hundred thousand?
Two hundred thousand? No, I don't think so.

340
00:27:44,813 --> 00:27:49,728
I think it's gonna be a lot closer to a million,
once you factor in the radiation.

341
00:27:49,813 --> 00:27:53,169
Is that what you want your legacy to be, Joe?

342
00:27:54,053 --> 00:27:57,170
Come on, Joe. Just open the door.

343
00:27:59,653 --> 00:28:01,883
Son of a bitch!

344
00:28:01,973 --> 00:28:05,045
That's the funny thing
about people like you, Joe.

345
00:28:05,133 --> 00:28:09,411
You wanna blame the rest of the world
for everything wrong with your life.

346
00:28:09,493 --> 00:28:12,610
The government's too big.
They're too powerful.

347
00:28:14,333 --> 00:28:17,689
Well, here's a bit of irony for you.

348
00:28:17,773 --> 00:28:20,765
You got all the power now, Joe.

349
00:28:21,733 --> 00:28:26,045
You got all the power.
Question is, what are you gonna do with it?

350
00:28:26,133 --> 00:28:29,728
You gonna let all those people die, Joe?

351
00:28:29,813 --> 00:28:34,443
Damm it, Joe! You are running out of time.

352
00:28:34,533 --> 00:28:37,127
We are all running out of time.

353
00:28:55,253 --> 00:28:56,732
You, uh...

354
00:28:58,653 --> 00:29:01,247
don't really like me very much, do you?

355
00:29:03,573 --> 00:29:04,972
That's crazy.

356
00:29:06,133 --> 00:29:11,253
I've been working for your father for
three years. I've been dating Marie for two.

357
00:29:12,613 --> 00:29:16,731
But you and l, we never
really got to know each other.

358
00:29:18,773 --> 00:29:21,162
No, no, we haven't.

359
00:29:22,493 --> 00:29:24,882
So, you don't know who I am.

360
00:29:28,453 --> 00:29:31,365
I know my sister loves you.

361
00:29:31,453 --> 00:29:33,444
Yes, she does.

362
00:29:43,733 --> 00:29:46,566
Where are you going?
It's not the way to Brent's.

363
00:29:46,653 --> 00:29:48,769
I want to show you something first.

364
00:29:48,853 --> 00:29:50,809
What?

365
00:29:50,893 --> 00:29:52,884
It'll only take a few minutes.

366
00:30:00,493 --> 00:30:02,563
Where are we going?

367
00:30:02,653 --> 00:30:07,522
I'm gonna let you in on a secret. In the
spirit of getting to know each other better.

368
00:30:16,493 --> 00:30:18,688
- Where are you taking me?
- You'll find out.

369
00:30:18,773 --> 00:30:21,128
- Tell me now or stop the car.
- It's a surprise.

370
00:30:21,213 --> 00:30:23,090
- Stop the car.
- We're almost there.

371
00:30:23,173 --> 00:30:25,164
I said stop the car!

372
00:30:28,733 --> 00:30:30,291
What are you doing?

373
00:30:30,373 --> 00:30:33,251
Why won’t you tell me where we're going?

374
00:30:35,293 --> 00:30:37,284
I wanted to show you the house.

375
00:30:37,373 --> 00:30:39,841
- What house?
- The house...

376
00:30:40,253 --> 00:30:43,370
I just bought for Marie
as a wedding present.

377
00:30:44,613 --> 00:30:47,605
I wanted you to be the first one to see it.

378
00:30:57,133 --> 00:30:58,851
Stand back.

379
00:30:58,933 --> 00:31:01,606
All right, step aside.

380
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:04,969
Let's get ready to get blood pressure.

381
00:31:09,413 --> 00:31:11,244
OK.

382
00:31:12,013 --> 00:31:14,686
BP's 80 over 50. Get some saline into her stat.

383
00:31:14,773 --> 00:31:16,570
- Is she all right?
- She's haemorrhaging.

384
00:31:16,653 --> 00:31:20,248
The girder staunched the bleeding,
but once we lifted it off, the dam broke.

385
00:31:20,333 --> 00:31:21,368
Can you stop it?

386
00:31:21,453 --> 00:31:25,241
If we don't get her to the ER,
she'll bleed to death.

387
00:31:25,333 --> 00:31:29,087
Easy. Watch her neck there.

388
00:31:29,173 --> 00:31:31,641
Come on, let's go. Let's get her out, guys.

389
00:31:32,213 --> 00:31:33,885
One, two, three.

390
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:36,167
All right, easy.

391
00:31:36,253 --> 00:31:38,244
All right, set her down.

392
00:31:39,373 --> 00:31:41,364
Let's go, let's go.

393
00:32:02,933 --> 00:32:06,050
Get a structural engineer
and get him over here now.

394
00:32:06,133 --> 00:32:08,693
I have to keep people working.
What's going on?

395
00:32:08,773 --> 00:32:11,241
I thought you weren't coming back here.

396
00:32:11,333 --> 00:32:13,324
- I changed my mind.
- You did? Why?

397
00:32:13,413 --> 00:32:16,052
I don't have to answer to you.
How bad is she?

398
00:32:16,133 --> 00:32:17,725
She's bleeding internally.

399
00:32:17,813 --> 00:32:21,647
- Anything you can do, you can do here?
- No. She needs surgery.

400
00:32:21,733 --> 00:32:24,327
- Are you gonna put her under anaesthesia?
- Yes.

401
00:32:24,413 --> 00:32:26,404
- How long will she be under?
- A few hours.

402
00:32:26,493 --> 00:32:30,008
Then she stays here. Everything we have
on this nuke has been destroyed.

403
00:32:30,093 --> 00:32:34,291
All we have is the database Paula sent
to the NSA and they didn't get the code.

404
00:32:34,373 --> 00:32:36,523
We'll assign other IT people to retrieve it.

405
00:32:36,613 --> 00:32:40,765
- She's the only one who can decrypt the files.
- We'll send a programmer with her.

406
00:32:40,853 --> 00:32:44,641
We don't have time.
I need her here and I need her lucid.

407
00:32:44,733 --> 00:32:48,282
I don't care what you have to do.
Can you get her conscious?

408
00:32:48,373 --> 00:32:51,171
I can maybe get her BP up temporarily.

409
00:32:51,253 --> 00:32:55,087
- You're out of your mind.
- Tell yourself that if it makes you feel better.

410
00:32:55,173 --> 00:32:58,210
This girl deserves a chance to live.

411
00:32:58,293 --> 00:33:01,842
Wake her up. Now!

412
00:33:18,973 --> 00:33:21,441
Tell me we're clear.

413
00:33:21,533 --> 00:33:24,730
Good. I'll speak to you soon. Bye-bye.

414
00:33:24,813 --> 00:33:28,772
Sir, this is Jenny's statement
to the press about the CTU bombing.

415
00:33:28,853 --> 00:33:34,325
I took a quick pass but we can go over it
whenever you get a chance, all right?

416
00:33:34,413 --> 00:33:37,007
Were you ever gonna tell me?

417
00:33:42,893 --> 00:33:49,002
About the 30 minutes after Jack Bauer called,
and the time you finally warned CTU.

418
00:33:53,693 --> 00:33:56,605
Lynne, I am the president
of the United States.

419
00:33:58,053 --> 00:34:01,125
Did you really think I wouldn't find out?

420
00:34:04,253 --> 00:34:07,962
What reason could you have had
for keeping this information from me?

421
00:34:08,053 --> 00:34:11,204
- Sir, I tried to tell you.
- Not hard enough.

422
00:34:11,293 --> 00:34:15,889
Sir, when Jack Bauer called, you were with
the press. I tried to get a message to you.

423
00:34:15,973 --> 00:34:21,001
Good. Now, after we found out
that CTU had been hit,

424
00:34:21,093 --> 00:34:25,291
you still kept from me the fact
that you knew 30 minutes earlier.

425
00:34:39,373 --> 00:34:42,490
Sir, you're right. There's no excuse.

426
00:34:42,573 --> 00:34:44,564
None.

427
00:34:49,893 --> 00:34:53,488
After Jack Bauer called,
did you tell anyone else?

428
00:34:59,373 --> 00:35:02,331
You told Rayburn, didn’t you?

429
00:35:02,413 --> 00:35:05,883
And he was the one
that wanted you to keep it from me.

430
00:35:05,973 --> 00:35:09,283
That's why you two were arguing earlier.

431
00:35:09,373 --> 00:35:13,571
Sir, I think, under the circumstances,
it would be best if I tendered my resignation.

432
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:15,962
I'll decide what's best.

433
00:35:16,053 --> 00:35:18,692
Yes, of course, sir.

434
00:35:18,773 --> 00:35:21,765
As much as I appreciate the gesture,

435
00:35:21,853 --> 00:35:25,892
I don't have time
to appease your guilty conscience.

436
00:35:31,293 --> 00:35:34,490
But I still trust you, Lynne.

437
00:35:34,573 --> 00:35:38,088
And I trust you’ll tell me
everything that happened.

438
00:35:39,813 --> 00:35:42,122
What's going on? Why is she here?

439
00:35:45,653 --> 00:35:48,690
- Why is Paula still here?
- It's Mason's call.

440
00:35:48,773 --> 00:35:51,765
She has almost no chance
if we don't get her to a hospital now.

441
00:35:51,853 --> 00:35:53,047
Yeah, I know.

442
00:35:53,133 --> 00:35:55,966
- I thought Mason wasn't even coming back.
- He's back.

443
00:35:56,053 --> 00:36:00,524
He's trying to revive Paula long enough to
access the information she was sending NSA.

444
00:36:00,613 --> 00:36:02,888
So he's just gonna let her die?

445
00:36:02,973 --> 00:36:06,170
I'm not so sure Mason made the wrong call.

446
00:36:07,093 --> 00:36:11,689
I mean, Paula is the only person
that can retrieve that information.

447
00:36:28,973 --> 00:36:30,964
I'm sorry.

448
00:36:31,573 --> 00:36:33,564
I'm sorry, Tony.

449
00:36:36,413 --> 00:36:39,689
It's just, I'm the one that brought her to CTU.

450
00:36:41,133 --> 00:36:43,124
I hired her.

451
00:36:45,133 --> 00:36:47,806
This job is all she ever wanted to do.

452
00:36:50,653 --> 00:36:53,804
She never even got a chance to do it.

453
00:36:53,893 --> 00:36:55,884
She did.

454
00:37:03,133 --> 00:37:06,091
We'd better get back to work.

455
00:37:21,533 --> 00:37:23,524
Please come with us, sir.

456
00:37:24,613 --> 00:37:28,083
- Come with you where?
- The president wants to see you.

457
00:37:52,733 --> 00:37:54,724
Mr President.

458
00:37:55,933 --> 00:37:58,766
You're out, Eric. Effective immediately.

459
00:37:58,853 --> 00:38:02,687
- Sir, if this is about...
- You know exactly what this is about.

460
00:38:02,773 --> 00:38:05,845
- You lied to me.
- Is that what Lynne told you?

461
00:38:05,933 --> 00:38:07,924
Lynne didn't have to tell me anything.

462
00:38:08,013 --> 00:38:12,768
You can't dismiss me now, sir. Not in
the middle of a crisis. You need me here.

463
00:38:12,853 --> 00:38:15,413
I need someone I can trust.

464
00:38:15,493 --> 00:38:17,643
I made a decision that you couldn't make.

465
00:38:17,733 --> 00:38:21,931
I'm the only one who could make it.
And now 27 people are dead.

466
00:38:22,013 --> 00:38:29,886
Collateral damage, sir. Regrettable but
necessary, so that Bauer could get to Wald.

467
00:38:34,413 --> 00:38:37,689
Get him out of here.
Mr Armus is waiting to talk to him.

468
00:38:51,653 --> 00:38:53,644
OK, Joe, this is how it lays out.

469
00:38:53,733 --> 00:38:57,772
Tactical team's gonna be here
in less than two minutes.

470
00:38:57,853 --> 00:39:00,242
This thing's gonna end in one of two ways.

471
00:39:00,333 --> 00:39:05,487
You're gonna either be dead or you're gonna
spend the rest of your life in prison.

472
00:39:05,573 --> 00:39:08,963
I'm giving you one last chance
to do the right thing.

473
00:39:09,053 --> 00:39:11,613
Open the door.

474
00:39:11,693 --> 00:39:14,685
I just need to know
who told you to target CTU.

475
00:39:18,133 --> 00:39:20,203
Joe, I'm out of time!

476
00:39:21,653 --> 00:39:23,644
Joe, open the door!

477
00:39:25,733 --> 00:39:27,724
You're a son of a bitch, Joe.

478
00:40:09,613 --> 00:40:11,604
Drop the weapon, Joe.

479
00:40:15,173 --> 00:40:19,769
The woman who gave me the plans to CTU,
I only met her twice.

480
00:40:21,733 --> 00:40:25,646
The second time Eddie took some pictures
from down the block.

481
00:40:25,733 --> 00:40:28,372
Drop the weapon!

482
00:40:28,453 --> 00:40:30,444
It's over, Jack.

483
00:40:31,933 --> 00:40:34,401
I can't go back to jail.

484
00:40:34,493 --> 00:40:36,484
No!

485
00:41:56,853 --> 00:42:00,562
