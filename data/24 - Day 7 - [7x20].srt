24 - Season 7
Episode 20

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,421
Previously on 24 ...

6
00:00:13,779 --> 00:00:16,547
You want me to blow up
a couple of dozen FBI agents?

7
00:00:16,615 --> 00:00:18,282
You got a problem with that?

8
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:20,017
Agent Walker, this is Jack.

9
00:00:20,085 --> 00:00:21,886
Get your men out of the
building-- it's a trap.

10
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:26,758
You got the canister?

11
00:00:28,894 --> 00:00:31,129
Clearly, Hodges
is behind this.

12
00:00:31,196 --> 00:00:34,098
I want him taken to
the FBI for interrogation.

13
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:35,432
He's a sociopath, Mom.

14
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,901
He's not going to talk--
he's going to want

15
00:00:36,969 --> 00:00:39,070
to make some kind of deal
in exchange for his cooperation.

16
00:00:39,138 --> 00:00:41,205
- Mom, you're not considering that.
- Olivia...

17
00:00:41,273 --> 00:00:43,775
You know what this man is,
what he did to Roger.

18
00:00:43,842 --> 00:00:46,310
I've upset the cart, have I?

19
00:00:46,378 --> 00:00:48,112
That bioweapon that you developed

20
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,281
for us was not intended
for personal use.

21
00:00:50,348 --> 00:00:51,415
I think we can both agree

22
00:00:51,483 --> 00:00:53,251
that there's no reason
for your family

23
00:00:53,318 --> 00:00:54,618
to pay for your mistakes.

24
00:00:54,686 --> 00:00:56,487
It will induce
a cardiac arrest

25
00:00:56,554 --> 00:00:58,122
and leave no trace
in your system.

26
00:01:04,429 --> 00:01:07,364
We are rerouting
to West Arlington Hospital.

27
00:01:07,432 --> 00:01:09,600
Have you heard from Almeida?

28
00:01:09,668 --> 00:01:11,502
I called him before I met
with Hodges.

29
00:01:11,569 --> 00:01:13,304
Has he secured the canister?

30
00:01:13,371 --> 00:01:14,305
- Soon.
- He's your guy.

31
00:01:14,372 --> 00:01:15,606
He better not screw this up.

32
00:01:15,674 --> 00:01:17,842
I have faith
he'll come through.

33
00:01:19,244 --> 00:01:20,211
Why don't you go back
to FBI Medical

34
00:01:20,279 --> 00:01:22,500
and let them
treat you?

35
00:01:22,514 --> 00:01:23,948
There is no treatment.

36
00:01:24,016 --> 00:01:25,382
There is no cure.

37
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:26,717
It's almost like
they knew, Jack.

38
00:01:26,785 --> 00:01:27,718
They would have
needed time

39
00:01:27,786 --> 00:01:28,820
to wire this building
with explosives.

40
00:01:28,887 --> 00:01:30,587
This is the last sector
we were due to search.

41
00:01:30,655 --> 00:01:32,290
What?

42
00:01:33,692 --> 00:01:34,926
What is your involvement?

43
00:01:34,993 --> 00:01:36,127
You're not thinking straight.

44
00:01:36,195 --> 00:01:38,162
The toxin's starting
to affect your judgment.

45
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:40,131
- Now, why don't you put the gun down.
- Don't you move!

46
00:01:43,601 --> 00:01:45,769
I never wanted to
hurt you, Jack.

47
00:01:45,838 --> 00:01:47,305
I told you to stay out of it.

48
00:01:47,372 --> 00:01:48,405
We get some help here?

49
00:01:48,473 --> 00:01:50,007
This man's having a seizure.

50
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:03,000
The following takes place
between 03:00 A.M. and 04:00 A.M.

51
00:02:17,275 --> 00:02:19,209
Mr. Bauer, you should be
feeling better already.

52
00:02:19,277 --> 00:02:21,345
I'm giving you five CC's
of intravenous pendopamine.

53
00:02:21,413 --> 00:02:22,612
It'll de-constrict your muscles.

54
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,780
Just hang in there.

55
00:02:24,916 --> 00:02:27,684
Don't talk.
Your vocal cords are in spasm.

56
00:02:27,752 --> 00:02:29,053
What the hell happened?

57
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,421
Tony Almeida found him
in full seizure.

58
00:02:30,488 --> 00:02:31,855
What about the medication
pack you gave him?

59
00:02:31,923 --> 00:02:33,223
He wasn't carrying it.

60
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:34,525
S-s-stop.

61
00:02:34,592 --> 00:02:35,992
Mr. Bauer,
please don't speak.

62
00:02:36,061 --> 00:02:37,061
Stop...

63
00:02:37,128 --> 00:02:38,262
Tony...

64
00:02:38,329 --> 00:02:39,396
Tony?

65
00:02:39,464 --> 00:02:40,697
I don't ... I don't understand.

66
00:02:40,765 --> 00:02:42,933
He's... second man.

67
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,868
Jack, what...
Put out an APB.

68
00:02:44,936 --> 00:02:46,260
How do you know this?

69
00:02:46,271 --> 00:02:48,038
Do it!

70
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,900
Attention, all patrols
and perimeter teams,

71
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:50,800
this is Alpha One.

72
00:02:50,843 --> 00:02:52,844
I'm issuing a priority APB
on Tony Almeida.

73
00:02:52,911 --> 00:02:54,044
Approach with extreme caution.

74
00:02:54,112 --> 00:02:55,212
He's colluding with Galvez

75
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,280
and should be
considered hostile.

76
00:02:56,348 --> 00:02:57,648
All units who engage the suspect

77
00:02:57,716 --> 00:03:00,317
should do so
with extreme caution.

78
00:03:21,807 --> 00:03:25,409
Ok, You really need to give
yourself more time to recover.

79
00:03:25,476 --> 00:03:26,911
Here's another med pack.

80
00:03:26,978 --> 00:03:28,478
Make sure he doesn't lose it.

81
00:03:28,546 --> 00:03:31,182
I need to go tend
to the other wounded.

82
00:03:32,984 --> 00:03:35,352
All right, tell me what
the hell is going on.

83
00:03:38,423 --> 00:03:41,458
Tony was working with
Galvez all along.

84
00:03:42,593 --> 00:03:44,494
He used us, all of us,
so that he

85
00:03:44,562 --> 00:03:45,863
could get to the canister.

86
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:49,600
So, wait, what
are you saying, that...

87
00:03:49,667 --> 00:03:52,336
Tony killed Larry?

88
00:03:53,371 --> 00:03:54,871
Yes.

89
00:03:54,939 --> 00:03:56,506
They must have
ambushed him

90
00:03:56,574 --> 00:03:58,342
as the chopper
was setting down.

91
00:03:58,409 --> 00:04:01,578
Tony stayed behind so he
could monitor our search,

92
00:04:01,646 --> 00:04:03,413
set the trap
and make sure Galvez

93
00:04:03,481 --> 00:04:04,615
could get beyond
the perimeter.

94
00:04:04,682 --> 00:04:06,216
Oh, God.

95
00:04:06,284 --> 00:04:07,951
I'm so sorry.

96
00:04:09,019 --> 00:04:11,421
This is my fault.

97
00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:14,591
I vouched for him to you,
to the president.

98
00:04:16,827 --> 00:04:20,397
I made a terrible,
terrible mistake.

99
00:04:20,465 --> 00:04:23,300
I felt that something was wrong.
Things weren't adding up.

100
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:25,302
I just...

101
00:04:27,305 --> 00:04:28,639
I just wanted to believe him.

102
00:04:28,706 --> 00:04:31,074
Alpha One, this is Agent Kilner.

103
00:04:31,142 --> 00:04:32,709
Alpha One-- go ahead.

104
00:04:32,777 --> 00:04:35,345
Agent Walker,
I'm at checkpoint Delta.

105
00:04:35,413 --> 00:04:37,381
I've got two agents dead,
shot point-blank.

106
00:04:37,448 --> 00:04:38,615
Their vehicle is missing.

107
00:04:38,683 --> 00:04:40,384
Okay, he's made it
past the perimeter.

108
00:04:40,451 --> 00:04:42,986
Tracking on the vehicle has been
disabled-- position is unknown.

109
00:04:43,053 --> 00:04:44,988
Widen the perimeter,
and keep looking for Almeida.

110
00:04:45,055 --> 00:04:46,823
If we lose him,
we lose the canister.

111
00:04:46,891 --> 00:04:48,091
Copy that.

112
00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:50,394
You're not gonna find him--
he's gone.

113
00:04:50,461 --> 00:04:52,061
We need to phone the president.

114
00:04:52,129 --> 00:04:53,263
Let's go.

115
00:05:34,472 --> 00:05:36,673
You made it.

116
00:05:36,741 --> 00:05:38,242
You sound surprised.

117
00:05:38,309 --> 00:05:41,178
After Bauer called you out,
I wasn't sure you would.

118
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,382
You don't have to worry
about Jack Bauer.

119
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:47,618
He's not gonna
be a problem.

120
00:05:50,021 --> 00:05:51,755
So, where is the canister?

121
00:05:52,823 --> 00:05:54,057
Where's the money?

122
00:05:56,494 --> 00:05:58,228
Hey, that was our agreement.

123
00:05:58,296 --> 00:06:00,096
Money first.

124
00:06:07,972 --> 00:06:09,473
There you go.

125
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:12,376
It's all there,
wired into your account.

126
00:06:12,443 --> 00:06:14,978
You can check
it if you want.

127
00:06:15,046 --> 00:06:17,113
I want.

128
00:06:25,923 --> 00:06:27,857
Everything okay?

129
00:06:27,925 --> 00:06:29,393
Yeah.

130
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,027
So, where is the canister?

131
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,367
Right here.

132
00:06:45,142 --> 00:06:47,744
So, what are you planning
on doing with it?

133
00:06:47,812 --> 00:06:49,813
Not really your
business, is it?

134
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,748
You gonna sell it?

135
00:07:01,826 --> 00:07:03,493
You don't want to do this.

136
00:07:03,561 --> 00:07:05,395
Hey, who's the damn buyer?

137
00:07:26,284 --> 00:07:27,684
Where's the canister?

138
00:07:27,752 --> 00:07:29,486
Where is the
damn canister?!

139
00:07:31,155 --> 00:07:33,890
One of the marines
that was guarding Hodges

140
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:35,859
noticed he was trying
to swallow something.

141
00:07:35,926 --> 00:07:37,461
He intervened, got
him to the hospital

142
00:07:37,528 --> 00:07:39,663
before the poison could
be completely ingested.

143
00:07:39,731 --> 00:07:41,064
So, he'll survive?

144
00:07:41,132 --> 00:07:42,799
Yes, ma'am,
but the doctors

145
00:07:42,867 --> 00:07:44,334
are surprised he
pulled through.

146
00:07:44,402 --> 00:07:46,570
That's because they never met
the son of a bitch.

147
00:07:46,638 --> 00:07:48,305
How did Hodges get this poison?

148
00:07:48,373 --> 00:07:51,174
We suspect from a woman
who claimed to be his attorney.

149
00:07:51,242 --> 00:07:52,242
Claimed to be?

150
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:53,543
She was an impostor.

151
00:07:53,611 --> 00:07:55,712
DC Police found the body
of Hodges' real attorney

152
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:56,780
about five minutes ago.

153
00:07:56,847 --> 00:07:58,047
We're still trying
to determine

154
00:07:58,115 --> 00:07:59,783
how she managed to
breach security.

155
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:02,051
Madam President, Agent Walker
and Jack Bauer.

156
00:08:02,119 --> 00:08:04,620
- Put them through.
- Yes ma'am.

157
00:08:05,089 --> 00:08:06,490
This is President Taylor.

158
00:08:06,557 --> 00:08:07,791
I'm here with Tim Woods.

159
00:08:07,858 --> 00:08:08,892
Madam President...

160
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:10,627
Have you secured the canister?

161
00:08:10,695 --> 00:08:11,995
I'm afraid not, ma'am.

162
00:08:12,062 --> 00:08:13,830
Our suspect escaped
beyond the perimeter.

163
00:08:13,898 --> 00:08:16,333
I was told that the area
was locked down.

164
00:08:16,401 --> 00:08:17,467
What happened?

165
00:08:17,535 --> 00:08:19,336
He had help, Madam President.

166
00:08:19,404 --> 00:08:20,737
From Tony Almeida.

167
00:08:20,805 --> 00:08:22,439
Almeida?

168
00:08:22,507 --> 00:08:23,674
Yes, ma'am.

169
00:08:23,741 --> 00:08:25,275
He was working for us.

170
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:26,677
It only appeared
that way.

171
00:08:26,744 --> 00:08:28,445
Apparently, he was
pursuing his own agenda,

172
00:08:28,513 --> 00:08:30,079
trying to get his hands
on the canister.

173
00:08:30,147 --> 00:08:31,981
Madam President, I know
I vouched for him.

174
00:08:32,049 --> 00:08:33,550
All I can tell you
right now

175
00:08:33,618 --> 00:08:35,251
is that I was wrong
and I'm sorry.

176
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,553
Now that we know he
has the canister,

177
00:08:36,621 --> 00:08:38,488
do we have any idea what
he intends to do with it?

178
00:08:38,556 --> 00:08:40,490
No, not yet.
Or where he is?

179
00:08:40,558 --> 00:08:43,293
We're all hands on deck here, sir,
regrouping to develop leads.

180
00:08:43,361 --> 00:08:45,962
I may have one.

181
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:48,064
As Hodges was taken
into custody,

182
00:08:48,132 --> 00:08:50,266
he yelled at me
about some larger group

183
00:08:50,335 --> 00:08:52,436
that would continue on
after his arrest.

184
00:08:52,503 --> 00:08:54,471
Something that I wouldn't
be able to stop.

185
00:08:54,539 --> 00:08:55,872
What do you think
he meant?

186
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,173
Well, all I know for sure

187
00:08:57,241 --> 00:08:59,108
is that someone doesn't
want Hodges to talk.

188
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,500
Shortly after he was arrested,
Hodges was visited

189
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:03,413
by a woman impersonating
his lawyer.

190
00:09:03,481 --> 00:09:05,716
She apparently gave him
some kind of lethal drug,

191
00:09:05,783 --> 00:09:08,117
because ten minutes later,
he tried to commit suicide.

192
00:09:08,185 --> 00:09:09,919
Tried to commit suicide?

193
00:09:09,987 --> 00:09:11,488
Oh, he's still alive.

194
00:09:11,556 --> 00:09:14,123
Jonas Hodges was
completely unrepentant.

195
00:09:14,191 --> 00:09:16,960
Now, this suicide attempt
must have been coerced.

196
00:09:17,027 --> 00:09:17,994
Well, obviously,
they're holding something

197
00:09:18,062 --> 00:09:19,195
over him, most likely
his family.

198
00:09:19,263 --> 00:09:20,397
If that's the case,
Madam President,

199
00:09:20,465 --> 00:09:21,665
we need to talk to him.

200
00:09:21,733 --> 00:09:24,401
Jack, even after everything
that's happened today,

201
00:09:24,469 --> 00:09:27,604
I will not allow any kind
of coercive interrogation.

202
00:09:27,672 --> 00:09:29,706
Madam President, that
won't be necessary.

203
00:09:29,774 --> 00:09:31,274
- He'll talk.
- How can you be sure?

204
00:09:31,342 --> 00:09:33,343
Because we can offer Hodges
something that he needs.

205
00:09:33,411 --> 00:09:34,644
And what's that?

206
00:09:34,712 --> 00:09:36,380
Proof of death:
We can convince the people

207
00:09:36,447 --> 00:09:37,848
that wanted him dead
that they succeeded.

208
00:09:37,915 --> 00:09:40,316
It's the only way Hodges
can protect his family.

209
00:09:40,385 --> 00:09:41,785
Madam President, right now,

210
00:09:41,853 --> 00:09:43,387
he's the only lead we've got.

211
00:09:54,365 --> 00:09:55,399
Hey.

212
00:10:01,672 --> 00:10:04,040
I'll assume that
was necessary.

213
00:10:04,108 --> 00:10:05,575
Don't start with me.

214
00:10:05,643 --> 00:10:07,343
I'm not in the mood.

215
00:10:07,412 --> 00:10:08,845
All right.

216
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:12,048
Mr. Galvez decided

217
00:10:12,116 --> 00:10:13,784
to hide the canister from me,

218
00:10:13,851 --> 00:10:16,986
so, uh, I had to find out
where it was.

219
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:21,925
We've got a
delivery to make.

220
00:10:21,992 --> 00:10:23,192
Shall we go?

221
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:24,928
No, I don't think we should.

222
00:10:25,963 --> 00:10:27,130
They're expecting us.

223
00:10:27,197 --> 00:10:29,466
Yeah, well, the way I see it,

224
00:10:29,534 --> 00:10:32,803
they're gonna take this canister
that I sweated blood for

225
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:35,338
and sit on it for six months.

226
00:10:35,406 --> 00:10:36,606
Not sit on it.

227
00:10:36,674 --> 00:10:38,241
They're gonna use it
to make more pathogen.

228
00:10:38,309 --> 00:10:40,276
We had 27 canisters...
Now we have one.

229
00:10:40,344 --> 00:10:41,945
Yeah, and I say one's enough.

230
00:10:43,448 --> 00:10:45,682
Look...

231
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:48,752
the government's reeling.

232
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,654
The FBI is stretched thin--

233
00:10:50,721 --> 00:10:52,088
scrambling, making mistakes.

234
00:10:52,156 --> 00:10:54,123
Another attack today
is all we need

235
00:10:54,191 --> 00:10:56,092
to push this thing
right over the edge.

236
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,929
This is no time to pull back.

237
00:11:00,698 --> 00:11:02,532
I say we take that canister,

238
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,701
and finish the job off today.

239
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:11,107
I don't disagree with you

240
00:11:11,175 --> 00:11:13,343
but it's not
our decision to make.

241
00:11:14,479 --> 00:11:16,746
Fine.

242
00:11:16,814 --> 00:11:17,914
Then run it by your group

243
00:11:17,982 --> 00:11:20,884
or your gang or whatever
the hell they are.

244
00:11:20,952 --> 00:11:22,318
But they'll know one thing.

245
00:11:22,386 --> 00:11:24,821
You finish your enemy off
when he's down.

246
00:11:24,889 --> 00:11:26,690
You don't let him
get back up and reload.

247
00:11:26,757 --> 00:11:28,625
I guarantee you,
this thing's gonna be

248
00:11:28,693 --> 00:11:30,293
a hell of a lot harder

249
00:11:30,361 --> 00:11:31,995
to pull off six
months from now.

250
00:11:32,062 --> 00:11:35,164
And you can say what
you want about Jonas Hodges,

251
00:11:35,232 --> 00:11:37,166
the fact is,

252
00:11:37,234 --> 00:11:39,135
he gave us an opportunity today.

253
00:11:41,171 --> 00:11:43,740
Let's take it.

254
00:11:49,547 --> 00:11:51,047
I'll contact the group.

255
00:11:52,082 --> 00:11:54,083
Good.

256
00:12:10,152 --> 00:12:11,352
What did she say exactly?

257
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,121
Only that she needs to see you

258
00:12:13,189 --> 00:12:14,388
and that it's urgent.

259
00:12:14,456 --> 00:12:16,390
I heard rumors
about the FBI operation.

260
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:18,259
I'm sure your mother
will fill you in, ma'am.

261
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:22,563
Olivia.

262
00:12:22,631 --> 00:12:24,599
Is it true the
FBI perimeter was breached?

263
00:12:24,666 --> 00:12:25,900
I'm afraid so.

264
00:12:25,968 --> 00:12:27,368
The canister is now
outside the cordon.

265
00:12:27,436 --> 00:12:28,870
What are we doing
to get it back?

266
00:12:28,938 --> 00:12:31,106
Tim, would you
excuse us for a moment?

267
00:12:31,373 --> 00:12:32,873
Of course.

268
00:12:39,181 --> 00:12:41,716
What is it?

269
00:12:41,784 --> 00:12:44,219
I need you to call
the Attorney General

270
00:12:44,286 --> 00:12:47,555
and draft a witness protection
agreement for Jonas Hodges.

271
00:12:47,623 --> 00:12:50,191
Witness protection?

272
00:12:50,259 --> 00:12:51,659
You can't be serious.

273
00:12:51,727 --> 00:12:53,862
Less than an hour ago,

274
00:12:53,929 --> 00:12:56,030
Hodges tried to kill himself.

275
00:12:56,098 --> 00:12:58,366
And we all believe that
he must've been coerced.

276
00:12:58,433 --> 00:12:59,567
By whom?

277
00:12:59,635 --> 00:13:01,502
You remember his rant--

278
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:03,938
that he is a cog
in a larger conspiracy,

279
00:13:04,006 --> 00:13:05,573
that there are others
who will carry on.

280
00:13:05,641 --> 00:13:08,209
You think they're the ones
who took the canister?

281
00:13:08,277 --> 00:13:09,410
Well, we need to find out.

282
00:13:09,478 --> 00:13:11,980
Which is why we need
to get Hodges to talk.

283
00:13:12,047 --> 00:13:15,349
Olivia, we feel
confident that he will

284
00:13:15,417 --> 00:13:17,618
if we can assure him that
these people will believe

285
00:13:17,686 --> 00:13:20,155
that his suicide attempt
actually succeeded.

286
00:13:20,222 --> 00:13:22,657
We need to make
him disappear.

287
00:13:22,724 --> 00:13:24,993
Which is why I need
the protection agreement.

288
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:26,920
There is no other way
he'll talk.

289
00:13:27,329 --> 00:13:30,231
Designate him an enemy combatant,
then treat him like one.

290
00:13:30,299 --> 00:13:31,666
We don't do that.

291
00:13:31,733 --> 00:13:33,100
Not in this administration.

292
00:13:33,168 --> 00:13:36,170
And it's not as if he's
getting a free pass.

293
00:13:36,238 --> 00:13:37,171
He'll be under
federal supervision

294
00:13:37,239 --> 00:13:38,172
for the rest of his life.

295
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,141
Oh, yeah, on a hundred acre
ranch in Colorado!

296
00:13:43,345 --> 00:13:46,547
This man murdered your son!

297
00:13:48,584 --> 00:13:51,919
My brother.

298
00:13:51,986 --> 00:13:55,055
Not to mention hundreds
of innocent civilians.

299
00:13:55,123 --> 00:13:57,124
I don't need you
to tell me what he's done.

300
00:13:57,192 --> 00:13:58,226
Apparently you do.

301
00:13:58,293 --> 00:13:59,760
Olivia, stop it!

302
00:13:59,828 --> 00:14:01,128
What would Dad say?

303
00:14:01,196 --> 00:14:02,363
I bet you're afraid to ask.

304
00:14:02,431 --> 00:14:04,932
I said stop!

305
00:14:08,036 --> 00:14:11,472
Do you think that
this is easy for me?

306
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:14,709
You think it doesn't
tear me apart?

307
00:14:16,745 --> 00:14:19,747
I'm Roger's mother.

308
00:14:24,052 --> 00:14:26,654
But I am also the President
of the United States

309
00:14:26,722 --> 00:14:28,489
and I placed my hand on a Bible

310
00:14:28,557 --> 00:14:30,524
and swore to protect and defend
the Constitution.

311
00:14:30,592 --> 00:14:31,592
You

312
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:32,860
are my Chief of Staff.

313
00:14:32,927 --> 00:14:35,829
I need you to act like one.

314
00:14:37,866 --> 00:14:39,767
Now, Jonas Hodges

315
00:14:39,834 --> 00:14:42,603
is at the FBI, and Jack Bauer
will be there shortly.

316
00:14:42,671 --> 00:14:44,505
I need an agreement drafted.

317
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:48,542
Do that please.

318
00:14:52,947 --> 00:14:54,882
The plan is
straightforward--

319
00:14:54,949 --> 00:14:56,550
an attack today
this morning

320
00:14:56,618 --> 00:14:58,386
during rush hour
using the bioweapon

321
00:14:58,453 --> 00:15:00,721
that Tony Almeida retrieved
from Starkwood.

322
00:15:00,789 --> 00:15:02,556
You should have each
received a data pack

323
00:15:02,624 --> 00:15:04,057
when you logged on to this call.

324
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:05,826
Please open it now.

325
00:15:05,894 --> 00:15:08,329
The attack will be attributed
to this man,

326
00:15:08,397 --> 00:15:10,331
Jibraan Al-Zarian--

327
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,533
whose body will be left
at the scene.

328
00:15:12,601 --> 00:15:14,201
The evidence trail
implicating him

329
00:15:14,269 --> 00:15:15,869
will include fabricated e-mails,

330
00:15:15,937 --> 00:15:17,104
phone records,

331
00:15:17,172 --> 00:15:19,206
and a large wire transfer
to his account

332
00:15:19,274 --> 00:15:20,974
via our favorite Yemini bank.

333
00:15:21,042 --> 00:15:23,010
I'm looking
at the briefing materials

334
00:15:23,077 --> 00:15:25,179
and I'm not seeing how this man
is actually connected

335
00:15:25,246 --> 00:15:26,580
to any terrorist group.

336
00:15:26,648 --> 00:15:27,915
He isn't.

337
00:15:27,982 --> 00:15:29,183
As previously discussed,

338
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:31,018
there are considerable
tactical advantages

339
00:15:31,085 --> 00:15:32,353
to using an innocent.

340
00:15:32,421 --> 00:15:33,921
But what about
his unpredictability?

341
00:15:33,988 --> 00:15:36,056
Al-Zarian has no agenda
of his own.

342
00:15:36,124 --> 00:15:39,193
He'll in fact be easier
to control and manipulate

343
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:41,195
than a real terrorist.
So what are

344
00:15:41,262 --> 00:15:43,197
the casualty estimates?

345
00:15:43,264 --> 00:15:46,033
Page three describes
the casualties estimates

346
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,401
as well as secondary effects.

347
00:15:47,469 --> 00:15:49,136
- As you can see, we've listed...
- Hold on.

348
00:15:49,204 --> 00:15:51,930
Forget about what casualties
may or may not be.

349
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:54,041
We're talking about launching
a new operation

350
00:15:54,108 --> 00:15:55,543
in the next few hours.

351
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:57,010
Without any planning.

352
00:15:57,078 --> 00:15:58,579
And with only one canister.

353
00:15:58,647 --> 00:16:01,114
The plan for this operation
was already in place.

354
00:16:01,182 --> 00:16:02,916
We'd just be accelerating
the timetable.

355
00:16:02,984 --> 00:16:04,652
We were going to have six months
to prepare.

356
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,920
There's no way to pull it
together in a few hours.

357
00:16:06,988 --> 00:16:08,556
I believe there is.

358
00:16:08,623 --> 00:16:10,558
With the support of this group.

359
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:11,726
Support for whom?

360
00:16:11,793 --> 00:16:13,527
This Tony Almeida
we barely know?

361
00:16:13,595 --> 00:16:14,895
And what about postattack plans?

362
00:16:14,963 --> 00:16:18,790
How's this group going to end up
where we need to be?

363
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,835
I agree. How we handle
ourselves politically

364
00:16:20,902 --> 00:16:22,870
in the aftermath of this event

365
00:16:22,937 --> 00:16:24,938
is just as important
as the attack itself.

366
00:16:25,006 --> 00:16:26,106
It always has been.

367
00:16:26,174 --> 00:16:27,274
In your opinion,

368
00:16:27,342 --> 00:16:28,942
is there time then to achieve

369
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:31,078
all our objectives
in the current scenario?

370
00:16:31,145 --> 00:16:32,880
Not with the same level
of certainty.

371
00:16:32,947 --> 00:16:34,281
Or anonymity.

372
00:16:34,349 --> 00:16:35,549
That's right.

373
00:16:35,617 --> 00:16:37,818
Well, then, maybe it's,
uh, definitive.

374
00:16:37,886 --> 00:16:38,886
What do you mean?

375
00:16:38,953 --> 00:16:40,287
There's no downside to waiting.

376
00:16:40,355 --> 00:16:42,322
There's a huge downside
to going in unprepared.

377
00:16:42,391 --> 00:16:44,759
Things go wrong,

378
00:16:44,826 --> 00:16:46,761
we're looking at exposure--

379
00:16:46,828 --> 00:16:48,161
for all of us.

380
00:16:48,229 --> 00:16:50,330
No, no, I still don't see it
that way.

381
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,332
Gentlemen.

382
00:16:52,401 --> 00:16:54,368
Ladies.

383
00:16:54,436 --> 00:16:56,537
I've listened to your comments

384
00:16:56,605 --> 00:16:58,572
and there's wisdom

385
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,008
in what I've heard.

386
00:17:01,075 --> 00:17:03,644
But there's also wisdom in
something I haven't heard.

387
00:17:03,712 --> 00:17:05,646
Jonas Hodges was a loose cannon,

388
00:17:05,714 --> 00:17:08,248
and the group
is well rid of him.

389
00:17:08,316 --> 00:17:11,285
But, in his lunacy,
he did us a favor.

390
00:17:11,352 --> 00:17:14,187
He did half our job for us.

391
00:17:14,255 --> 00:17:16,189
More than half.

392
00:17:16,257 --> 00:17:18,759
He pushed this country
to the brink.

393
00:17:18,827 --> 00:17:22,663
You don't get many gifts
like that.

394
00:17:23,698 --> 00:17:25,699
I say we take it.

395
00:17:27,368 --> 00:17:29,303
We have a quorum,

396
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:31,505
I'd like to call
for an immediate vote.

397
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,755
Tony.

398
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,693
How'd it go?

399
00:17:52,761 --> 00:17:54,762
Take a look.

400
00:18:01,937 --> 00:18:04,071
We're a go.

401
00:18:32,353 --> 00:18:33,953
Where's Hodges now?
Down the hall.

402
00:18:34,021 --> 00:18:35,955
We've set up a medical
suite in Secure Z.

403
00:18:36,023 --> 00:18:37,457
And the death certificate?

404
00:18:37,525 --> 00:18:38,825
Done.

405
00:18:38,892 --> 00:18:40,860
As far as the world knows,
he's molding on a slab

406
00:18:40,928 --> 00:18:42,862
at the coroner's.
Keep it that way.

407
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:44,364
No one knows he's alive

408
00:18:44,432 --> 00:18:46,233
unless they have to.
No, just the ambulance driver,

409
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,667
the medical team
and three security.

410
00:18:47,735 --> 00:18:48,835
All trustworthy.

411
00:18:48,902 --> 00:18:49,869
Wait.

412
00:18:49,937 --> 00:18:51,304
Are you sure he's up for this?

413
00:18:51,372 --> 00:18:52,439
I know what happened out there.

414
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:53,773
Medication worked.
He'll be okay.

415
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:55,074
I'm not talking
about the seizure.

416
00:18:55,142 --> 00:18:57,076
I'm talking about
the Tony Almeida situation.

417
00:18:57,144 --> 00:18:58,511
What about it?

418
00:18:58,579 --> 00:19:00,580
His former partner betrays him,

419
00:19:00,648 --> 00:19:02,014
he tries
to have you all killed--

420
00:19:02,082 --> 00:19:04,417
Jack must have some feelings
about that.

421
00:19:04,485 --> 00:19:05,918
Yeah.

422
00:19:05,986 --> 00:19:07,987
Yeah, I think it's what's
keeping him going.

423
00:19:10,258 --> 00:19:11,858
Listen to me.

424
00:19:11,925 --> 00:19:13,192
Listen to me.

425
00:19:13,261 --> 00:19:15,194
Is anyone listening?

426
00:19:15,263 --> 00:19:16,195
I know you're watching.

427
00:19:16,264 --> 00:19:18,197
I see the cameras!

428
00:19:18,266 --> 00:19:19,932
I know you're watching.

429
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,435
Do you realize
what you people have done?

430
00:19:22,503 --> 00:19:23,470
You didn't save me,

431
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:25,305
you killed my family!

432
00:19:25,373 --> 00:19:26,573
You killed my family!

433
00:19:26,641 --> 00:19:28,308
You killed them!

434
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:29,409
Killed them.
How long

435
00:19:29,477 --> 00:19:30,977
has he been conscious?
Ten minutes.

436
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:33,813
He's been talking about
his family ever since.

437
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:35,214
Biometrics are over here.

438
00:19:35,283 --> 00:19:37,016
Cardiac, respiratory,
plus dermal infrared.

439
00:19:37,084 --> 00:19:38,585
Good.
We'll know if he's lying.

440
00:19:38,653 --> 00:19:40,587
Jack,

441
00:19:40,655 --> 00:19:42,455
the president is
monitoring this.

442
00:19:42,523 --> 00:19:44,957
Sergeant, I'm asking you,

443
00:19:45,025 --> 00:19:47,126
soldier to soldier,
let me have your firearm.

444
00:19:47,194 --> 00:19:50,297
I'll use one...
one bullet on myself.

445
00:19:50,364 --> 00:19:51,331
Please.

446
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:52,732
Relax, Mr. Hodges.

447
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,302
You're already dead.

448
00:19:58,306 --> 00:20:00,307
Sergeant.

449
00:20:02,376 --> 00:20:04,411
Who are you?

450
00:20:04,478 --> 00:20:05,945
My name is Jack Bauer.

451
00:20:06,013 --> 00:20:07,980
And right now,
I'm the only chance

452
00:20:08,048 --> 00:20:10,317
your wife and children
have to stay alive.

453
00:20:10,384 --> 00:20:12,352
Explain that to me.

454
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,688
The people that wanted you dead
don't know you survived.

455
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:15,755
Tell us who they are,

456
00:20:15,823 --> 00:20:17,624
and we'll keep it that way.

457
00:20:17,692 --> 00:20:19,526
The President has agreed
to provide you with a death

458
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:21,695
certificate and witness
protection in exchange

459
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:23,697
for actionable information.

460
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:25,332
I can't watch this anymore.

461
00:20:25,399 --> 00:20:26,700
If you refuse, it'll be released

462
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:29,035
to the press that you are alive
and in our custody

463
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:30,303
and that you're cooperating.

464
00:20:30,371 --> 00:20:32,439
We'll let your friends
take care of the rest.

465
00:20:32,506 --> 00:20:34,441
My family is innocent.

466
00:20:34,508 --> 00:20:37,009
The president would never
allow that to happen.

467
00:20:37,077 --> 00:20:39,679
She doesn't have
the stomach for it.

468
00:20:39,747 --> 00:20:41,748
You might be right about that.

469
00:20:43,016 --> 00:20:44,984
But make no mistake
about it, sir.

470
00:20:45,052 --> 00:20:47,253
I do.

471
00:20:49,089 --> 00:20:50,357
Trust me.

472
00:20:50,424 --> 00:20:51,958
Do your family a favor.

473
00:20:52,025 --> 00:20:55,027
Just tell me who you've
been working with.

474
00:21:00,468 --> 00:21:02,402
I am--

475
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:04,904
I was--

476
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:07,240
part of a larger group
of like minds.

477
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:09,576
You mean, other companies
like Starkwood.

478
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:11,310
I mean people who can
protect this country

479
00:21:11,379 --> 00:21:12,846
better than any
government ever could.

480
00:21:12,913 --> 00:21:14,681
There are hundreds of private
military companies

481
00:21:14,749 --> 00:21:15,882
in this country, we're talking

482
00:21:15,949 --> 00:21:17,517
tens of thousands of people.

483
00:21:17,585 --> 00:21:18,885
But only a handful

484
00:21:18,952 --> 00:21:22,021
with the guts and the vision
to do what was necessary.

485
00:21:22,089 --> 00:21:23,189
And what is that?

486
00:21:23,257 --> 00:21:25,558
The plan was to launch
simultaneous attacks

487
00:21:25,626 --> 00:21:27,026
early next year.

488
00:21:27,094 --> 00:21:28,060
Multiple cities.

489
00:21:28,128 --> 00:21:29,562
So the public would finally see

490
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:31,063
that the government
can't protect them.

491
00:21:31,131 --> 00:21:33,500
They'd demand drastic measures
and we'd step in.

492
00:21:33,567 --> 00:21:35,502
How would you justify that
to the American people?

493
00:21:35,569 --> 00:21:36,669
Simple.

494
00:21:36,737 --> 00:21:38,004
Offload the blame.

495
00:21:38,071 --> 00:21:39,439
We were going to supply
the enemies

496
00:21:39,507 --> 00:21:41,173
that want to destroy
this country.

497
00:21:41,241 --> 00:21:42,909
Muhammed this,
Achmed that.

498
00:21:42,976 --> 00:21:45,412
From sleeper cells the
apologists say don't even exist.

499
00:21:45,479 --> 00:21:46,413
You of all people

500
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,914
should understand.

501
00:21:47,981 --> 00:21:49,282
Understand what?

502
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:51,451
I watched the Senate
hearing yesterday,

503
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:54,454
and I was disgusted
with how you were treated.

504
00:21:54,522 --> 00:21:56,456
You should be regarded
as a hero,

505
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:59,292
not a criminal.

506
00:22:00,327 --> 00:22:02,261
I broke the law.

507
00:22:02,329 --> 00:22:04,230
You were following

508
00:22:04,298 --> 00:22:07,366
your instinct to protect
your country, just like me.

509
00:22:07,435 --> 00:22:08,668
Mr. Hodges, I need the names

510
00:22:08,736 --> 00:22:10,369
of the people
that you are working with.

511
00:22:10,438 --> 00:22:12,739
I have spent my entire life
protecting this country

512
00:22:12,807 --> 00:22:14,974
from enemies large and small.

513
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:17,009
I created Starkwood
from the ground up.

514
00:22:17,077 --> 00:22:18,945
And the government
used us to great effect.

515
00:22:19,012 --> 00:22:21,347
And now they think
they can just throw us away.

516
00:22:21,415 --> 00:22:23,282
Are you telling me
that this has been

517
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:24,751
about protecting your
contracts, about money?

518
00:22:24,819 --> 00:22:27,887
I tried to tell the politicians
how vulnerable we are,

519
00:22:27,955 --> 00:22:29,355
and they wouldn't listen.

520
00:22:29,423 --> 00:22:30,924
So we decided to show them.

521
00:22:30,991 --> 00:22:33,927
By attacking your own country
with a biological weapon?

522
00:22:33,994 --> 00:22:35,528
By killing innocent people?

523
00:22:35,596 --> 00:22:38,364
Yes, a few innocent lives
would be lost,

524
00:22:38,432 --> 00:22:40,333
but only to save
the greater number.

525
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,835
Having the courage
to make those hard choices

526
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:43,302
gives us a lot in common,
Mr. Bauer.

527
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:45,572
Let me explain something to you.

528
00:22:45,639 --> 00:22:49,008
You and I have absolutely
nothing in common.

529
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:51,644
All that you have done today
is create a scenario

530
00:22:51,712 --> 00:22:52,946
by attacking your own country

531
00:22:53,013 --> 00:22:54,514
that has made you valuable again.

532
00:22:54,582 --> 00:22:56,015
Today has been nothing short

533
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:57,650
of a desperate grab for power,

534
00:22:57,718 --> 00:22:58,785
and it has failed.

535
00:22:58,853 --> 00:23:00,319
You have failed, and unless

536
00:23:00,387 --> 00:23:01,488
you want me to go public

537
00:23:01,555 --> 00:23:02,755
with the fact that
you are still alive,

538
00:23:02,823 --> 00:23:04,056
you are gonna
give me the names

539
00:23:04,124 --> 00:23:05,525
of the people that
you've been working with.

540
00:23:05,593 --> 00:23:06,793
I-I don't have them.
I want the names.

541
00:23:06,861 --> 00:23:08,795
I don't have any.
I want the names!

542
00:23:08,863 --> 00:23:10,630
I don't know any!

543
00:23:12,032 --> 00:23:14,033
Fine.

544
00:23:23,343 --> 00:23:25,712
Patch me through to Amy Meyer
at the Washington Post.

545
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:27,514
No.

546
00:23:27,581 --> 00:23:29,883
Amy, it's Jack. I have
a statement I need to make.

547
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,117
Wait!

548
00:23:31,184 --> 00:23:33,285
Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!
Give me the names!

549
00:23:33,353 --> 00:23:35,388
I swear... I swear
I don't have them.

550
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:37,456
This whole project was...
was based on anonymity.

551
00:23:37,525 --> 00:23:38,858
We never met in person.

552
00:23:38,926 --> 00:23:40,960
Everything was handled through
an intermediary, a woman.

553
00:23:41,028 --> 00:23:42,328
She never told me who she was.

554
00:23:42,396 --> 00:23:43,496
She never told me her name.

555
00:23:43,564 --> 00:23:44,664
I never asked her.

556
00:23:44,732 --> 00:23:46,298
The same woman
that gave you the poison?

557
00:23:46,366 --> 00:23:48,401
Yes, yes.

558
00:23:58,612 --> 00:24:00,112
Amy, I'm sorry.
Something's come up.

559
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:01,681
I've got to call you back.

560
00:24:03,918 --> 00:24:05,885
You tell yourself
whatever you want.

561
00:24:05,953 --> 00:24:07,654
You are a traitor.

562
00:24:07,721 --> 00:24:10,857
Witness Protection
was your promise.

563
00:24:10,925 --> 00:24:12,792
Yeah.

564
00:24:14,628 --> 00:24:16,996
Madam President,
did you hear everything

565
00:24:17,064 --> 00:24:18,464
that Hodges had to say?

566
00:24:18,532 --> 00:24:20,833
Yes. Is any of it even credible?

567
00:24:20,901 --> 00:24:22,669
All of it is.
Biometric monitors here indicate

568
00:24:22,736 --> 00:24:24,037
that he was telling the truth.

569
00:24:24,104 --> 00:24:25,605
Whoever they are,
this group just went

570
00:24:25,673 --> 00:24:26,973
through an awful
lot of trouble

571
00:24:27,041 --> 00:24:28,741
to get their hands
on that last canister.

572
00:24:28,809 --> 00:24:31,377
It seems very clear to me
that their plan is still on.

573
00:24:31,445 --> 00:24:33,012
You mean another attack?
Yes, ma'am.

574
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,814
I think you should proceed
under the assumption

575
00:24:34,882 --> 00:24:35,915
that they might
strike immediately.

576
00:24:35,983 --> 00:24:37,083
Hold on.

577
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:38,517
Hodges said some
time next year.

578
00:24:38,586 --> 00:24:40,219
No. Hodges said
that was the plan.

579
00:24:40,287 --> 00:24:42,789
Given the chaos
that he created today,

580
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:44,891
the smart strategic move
would be to act right now.

581
00:24:44,959 --> 00:24:47,026
Now, I believe the canister
is still in this area,

582
00:24:47,094 --> 00:24:48,527
so we're gonna have
to alert Homeland,

583
00:24:48,596 --> 00:24:50,029
have them start identifying
and raiding targets.

584
00:24:50,097 --> 00:24:51,330
Hodges said
that the plan was

585
00:24:51,398 --> 00:24:52,632
to enlist parties
with terrorist ties.

586
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:55,267
At this point, I think that
might be our most solid lead.

587
00:24:55,335 --> 00:24:56,803
Madam President, I
agree with Agent Walker.

588
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:58,537
We need to make
an immediate threat assessment

589
00:24:58,606 --> 00:25:00,974
with focus on all known
terrorist activity.

590
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:02,942
The fastest way
for us to get that information

591
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:04,944
is to gain access to the CTU servers

592
00:25:05,012 --> 00:25:06,679
that have been sealed as a result

593
00:25:06,747 --> 00:25:08,347
of Senator Mayer's investigation.

594
00:25:08,415 --> 00:25:11,484
I'll have them
recommissioned immediately.

595
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:13,419
And consider the resources
of this government

596
00:25:13,487 --> 00:25:15,488
at your disposal, Jack.

597
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:17,556
Thank you, ma'am.

598
00:25:17,625 --> 00:25:18,958
I need those servers
right away.

599
00:25:19,026 --> 00:25:20,893
They're in DOJ evidence
lockers on the third floor.

600
00:25:20,961 --> 00:25:22,261
I'll have I.T.
break them out.

601
00:25:22,329 --> 00:25:23,630
Okay, good.

602
00:25:23,697 --> 00:25:25,098
We have a new shift
of analysts coming in,

603
00:25:25,165 --> 00:25:27,033
if you can tell them
what you're looking for.

604
00:25:27,101 --> 00:25:28,300
No, we don't have time.

605
00:25:28,368 --> 00:25:29,969
We need someone
who already knows the protocols.

606
00:25:30,037 --> 00:25:31,137
I'll take care of it.

607
00:25:31,204 --> 00:25:32,805
Just get me those servers.

608
00:25:50,858 --> 00:25:51,991
Who is it?

609
00:25:52,059 --> 00:25:54,127
Hey, it's me Jack.

610
00:25:54,194 --> 00:25:56,129
Jack, where the hell are you?

611
00:25:56,196 --> 00:25:57,664
The FBI headquarters.

612
00:25:57,731 --> 00:25:59,198
I've been trying
to reach you all night.

613
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:00,466
No one will tell me anything.

614
00:26:00,534 --> 00:26:02,501
Is it true about Bill?

615
00:26:05,372 --> 00:26:06,739
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

616
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:15,314
What happened?

617
00:26:15,382 --> 00:26:17,984
He was killed during
the White House siege.

618
00:26:18,052 --> 00:26:20,053
Chloe, you should know,

619
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,889
Bill sacrificed his life
to save the president.

620
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:24,256
Listen to me.

621
00:26:24,324 --> 00:26:25,992
This threat is not over.

622
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:27,259
We believe that there's going

623
00:26:27,327 --> 00:26:29,528
to be a biological attack
somewhere in the area.

624
00:26:29,596 --> 00:26:31,764
Soon.
I need your help to stop it.

625
00:26:31,832 --> 00:26:33,299
How?

626
00:26:33,366 --> 00:26:35,835
I need you
to reconstitute the CTU servers.

627
00:26:35,903 --> 00:26:37,536
They were seized
when the CTU was decommissioned.

628
00:26:37,604 --> 00:26:38,805
I don't have access to them.

629
00:26:38,872 --> 00:26:41,074
You will
by the time you get here.

630
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:43,642
Who's doing this?

631
00:26:43,711 --> 00:26:45,211
We don't have all the players.

632
00:26:45,278 --> 00:26:48,848
I'll fill you in with as much
as I know when you get here.

633
00:26:48,916 --> 00:26:52,251
I'm sending a car
over to your hotel.

634
00:26:55,255 --> 00:26:57,223
Chloe?

635
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,595
Send a car.

636
00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:04,663
Thank you.

637
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:39,031
Morris, wake up.

638
00:27:39,098 --> 00:27:41,300
What? Are you speaking
to me again now?

639
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:42,635
I have to go.

640
00:27:42,702 --> 00:27:44,102
I need you to take Prescott
and get out of the city.

641
00:27:44,171 --> 00:27:45,837
- Why?
- I just spoke with Jack.

642
00:27:45,905 --> 00:27:47,839
There's going to
be another attack.

643
00:27:47,907 --> 00:27:49,341
This time, it's biological.

644
00:27:49,409 --> 00:27:51,777
Okay, then we'll all get out
of here together.

645
00:27:51,844 --> 00:27:53,879
I can't.
FBI needs me.

646
00:27:53,946 --> 00:27:56,448
But the last time
you worked for these people,

647
00:27:56,516 --> 00:27:57,849
they arrested you.

648
00:27:57,917 --> 00:27:59,351
I know.

649
00:27:59,419 --> 00:28:01,654
But I'm the only one that can
get the servers back online.

650
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:04,056
Well, I'm not gonna
leave you here.

651
00:28:04,123 --> 00:28:08,194
Not with the possibility
of a biological attack.

652
00:28:14,668 --> 00:28:15,967
Please.

653
00:28:16,035 --> 00:28:18,770
I'm the only one
that can do this.

654
00:28:18,838 --> 00:28:20,506
And Jack needs me.

655
00:28:20,574 --> 00:28:24,042
And I just need for you
and Prescott to be safe.

656
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:26,512
Okay?

657
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:28,714
I'll see you
back at home.

658
00:28:28,781 --> 00:28:32,418
Just... be careful.

659
00:28:34,487 --> 00:28:36,488
I will.

660
00:29:13,169 --> 00:29:15,703
All right, before we
begin, everyone make sure

661
00:29:15,771 --> 00:29:17,372
you have your updated
briefing packets,

662
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,208
and the latest
CDC abstract.

663
00:29:20,276 --> 00:29:21,809
Jack, whenever
you're ready.

664
00:29:21,877 --> 00:29:24,212
Thank you.

665
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:28,083
I know many of you have lost
friends and colleagues today.

666
00:29:29,418 --> 00:29:30,718
I have, too.

667
00:29:30,786 --> 00:29:33,330
Unfortunately, the time to mourn
these brave men and women

668
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:34,240
is going to have to wait.

669
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:36,191
'Cause, as many of you
are already aware,

670
00:29:36,258 --> 00:29:38,593
we are facing the threat
of a terrorist event

671
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:39,894
somewhere on the
eastern seaboard.

672
00:29:39,962 --> 00:29:41,362
We don't have specific intel

673
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:42,697
as to the time table
of this attack,

674
00:29:42,764 --> 00:29:44,466
but we do have
reason to believe that

675
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:47,235
the people that are behind this
will want to strike immediately.

676
00:29:47,303 --> 00:29:48,403
Excuse me.

677
00:29:48,471 --> 00:29:49,637
Tim Moran, field ops.

678
00:29:49,705 --> 00:29:51,372
Who are the people behind this?

679
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,774
Right now, we only have
two confirmed suspects.

680
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:56,111
Tony Almeida

681
00:29:56,178 --> 00:29:57,845
and the woman
he's been working with.

682
00:29:57,913 --> 00:29:59,380
We're still trying
to identify her.

683
00:29:59,448 --> 00:30:02,117
The assumption is, the two
of them are part of a broader

684
00:30:02,184 --> 00:30:04,051
conspiracy as outlined
in your briefing material.

685
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,620
And the nature of the attack?

686
00:30:05,687 --> 00:30:07,222
All it says here is biological.

687
00:30:07,289 --> 00:30:09,890
The actual pathogen is a prion
variant, designed to attack

688
00:30:09,958 --> 00:30:12,093
the central nervous system
and ultimately destroy it.

689
00:30:12,161 --> 00:30:13,528
Do we know what the target is?

690
00:30:13,596 --> 00:30:15,363
No, not yet.
We're also unclear

691
00:30:15,431 --> 00:30:17,132
on the specifics
of the delivery device.

692
00:30:17,199 --> 00:30:18,233
Well, what leads do we have?

693
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,501
Right now,

694
00:30:19,568 --> 00:30:21,603
we are solely working
off an operational theory

695
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:23,371
that the people
that are behind this

696
00:30:23,439 --> 00:30:24,639
will need
to manufacture evidence

697
00:30:24,706 --> 00:30:26,674
in an effort to offload
the blame for this attack

698
00:30:26,742 --> 00:30:28,109
to either another group
or an individual

699
00:30:28,177 --> 00:30:29,277
with terrorist sympathies.

700
00:30:29,345 --> 00:30:30,612
During the ensuing panic,

701
00:30:30,679 --> 00:30:32,747
these people will move in
and seize power

702
00:30:32,814 --> 00:30:35,716
under the guise of creating
and maintaining stability.

703
00:30:35,784 --> 00:30:38,119
So, our job here is
to look for traces

704
00:30:38,187 --> 00:30:39,490
of that manufactured evidence.

705
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,555
How exactly?

706
00:30:40,623 --> 00:30:43,224
Pattern searches of suspicious
financial transactions.

707
00:30:43,292 --> 00:30:45,560
Keyword intercepts
of existing wiretaps,

708
00:30:45,628 --> 00:30:46,727
websites and e-mails.

709
00:30:46,795 --> 00:30:47,895
And data-mining all

710
00:30:47,963 --> 00:30:49,664
NSA and CIA intelligence

711
00:30:49,731 --> 00:30:51,166
on jihadist activities
over the past six months.

712
00:30:51,233 --> 00:30:52,467
Excuse me.

713
00:30:52,535 --> 00:30:55,870
Not only is that type
of blanket surveillance illegal.

714
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:57,505
We don't have the capacity
to pull it off.

715
00:30:57,573 --> 00:30:58,673
The search algorithms

716
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:00,808
simply don't exist.
Yes, they do.

717
00:31:00,876 --> 00:31:02,544
- At CTU.
- Those servers were decommissioned.

718
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:03,744
Not anymore. They're here.

719
00:31:03,812 --> 00:31:05,746
We're in the process
of installing them now.

720
00:31:07,349 --> 00:31:09,684
Well, what does that make us,
CTU-lite?

721
00:31:09,751 --> 00:31:11,886
Last I heard,
the Bureau was

722
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:14,556
a federal entity
bound by federal statute.

723
00:31:14,623 --> 00:31:16,558
Janis, do this or I will find
someone else who will.

724
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:17,825
I do not have time to argue.

725
00:31:17,893 --> 00:31:19,327
I'm not arguing.
I'm asking.

726
00:31:19,395 --> 00:31:20,861
Moving on.

727
00:31:25,901 --> 00:31:28,169
- I've got her from here.
- Thanks.

728
00:31:28,237 --> 00:31:30,037
- Jack.
- Hey.

729
00:31:33,008 --> 00:31:34,975
Thanks for coming.

730
00:31:35,043 --> 00:31:36,143
You look like hell.

731
00:31:36,212 --> 00:31:37,712
Are you all right?
I'm fine.

732
00:31:37,779 --> 00:31:38,879
You don't look fine.

733
00:31:38,947 --> 00:31:40,047
Maybe a little tired.

734
00:31:40,115 --> 00:31:41,982
Did you get the report
I sent you?

735
00:31:42,050 --> 00:31:43,884
Yeah. I read it
on the way over.

736
00:31:43,952 --> 00:31:45,553
- It's terrifying. How real is this?
- Real.

737
00:31:45,621 --> 00:31:48,055
We're getting access to
the CTU servers, right?

738
00:31:48,123 --> 00:31:49,357
Yeah.
They're coming online now.

739
00:31:49,425 --> 00:31:50,658
Shouldn't I be supervising this?

740
00:31:50,726 --> 00:31:53,094
Yeah.
Look, there's something I need

741
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:54,895
to talk to you about
before we get started.

742
00:31:54,963 --> 00:31:57,898
There's no easy way
for me to say this.

743
00:31:57,966 --> 00:32:00,602
But Tony's been responsible
for these attacks.

744
00:32:02,471 --> 00:32:03,771
That's not possible.

745
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:05,773
He was using you
and Bill all along.

746
00:32:05,841 --> 00:32:06,941
He's really been working

747
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:08,743
for a group
of private military firms

748
00:32:08,810 --> 00:32:10,245
trying to destabilize
this country

749
00:32:10,312 --> 00:32:11,812
in an effort to seize power.

750
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,214
So far today,

751
00:32:13,282 --> 00:32:15,850
his actions have cost the lives
of hundreds of people.

752
00:32:15,917 --> 00:32:17,518
But he's threatening
thousands more.

753
00:32:17,586 --> 00:32:19,554
It doesn't make any sense.

754
00:32:19,622 --> 00:32:22,257
I know he was devastated
over Michelle, but...

755
00:32:22,324 --> 00:32:23,958
Chloe, he's not your friend.

756
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:27,395
The Tony that you knew--
he doesn't exist anymore.

757
00:32:27,463 --> 00:32:28,963
There has to be a reason.

758
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,431
A reason for what?

759
00:32:30,499 --> 00:32:32,433
Bringing down
two passenger planes?

760
00:32:32,501 --> 00:32:35,102
Trying to ambush
25 federal agents?

761
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:38,406
Chloe, he tried to kill me.

762
00:32:41,477 --> 00:32:44,044
He betrayed us all--
you, me,

763
00:32:44,112 --> 00:32:45,045
and Bill,

764
00:32:45,113 --> 00:32:47,415
and right now
our only responsibility

765
00:32:47,483 --> 00:32:48,549
is to stop him.

766
00:32:48,617 --> 00:32:50,752
Now, I need to know
that you can treat him

767
00:32:50,819 --> 00:32:53,655
as an enemy combatant,
that you are with me on this.

768
00:32:53,722 --> 00:32:56,791
Okay, I'll do
whatever you say.

769
00:32:56,858 --> 00:33:01,763
No, I need to know
that you are with me on this.

770
00:33:05,867 --> 00:33:07,802
I'm with you.

771
00:33:07,869 --> 00:33:09,236
Okay.

772
00:33:09,305 --> 00:33:11,306
Let's go.

773
00:33:23,151 --> 00:33:25,520
His name is Jibraan Al-Zarian.

774
00:33:25,587 --> 00:33:27,355
27 years old.

775
00:33:27,423 --> 00:33:30,291
He's a day laborer at
Cabrera Granite Construction.

776
00:33:30,359 --> 00:33:31,492
Immigration status?

777
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,493
Illegal.

778
00:33:32,561 --> 00:33:34,895
His visa expired
as of January.

779
00:33:34,963 --> 00:33:36,497
Ties to any
extremist groups?

780
00:33:36,565 --> 00:33:39,367
No, none, but there's
definitely anger there.

781
00:33:39,435 --> 00:33:40,535
Both parents were killed

782
00:33:40,602 --> 00:33:41,703
in a U.S. air strike
by the Pakistani border.

783
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:44,271
He was 11 at the time.

784
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:46,774
Fits the psych profile.

785
00:33:46,842 --> 00:33:49,944
Bit of a loner,
a mystery to his coworkers,

786
00:33:50,011 --> 00:33:51,379
and we build the rest.

787
00:33:51,447 --> 00:33:53,180
What about the family?

788
00:33:53,248 --> 00:33:56,951
One younger brother, who he's
pretty much raised on his own.

789
00:33:57,018 --> 00:33:58,018
It's perfect, huh?

790
00:33:59,722 --> 00:34:00,855
Though it is doubtful

791
00:34:00,922 --> 00:34:02,690
that anyone sleeps very well
in D.C. tonight,

792
00:34:02,758 --> 00:34:06,494
a certain calm has now settled
over the streets of Capitol Hill

793
00:34:06,562 --> 00:34:08,929
after an unprecedented series
of terror attacks

794
00:34:08,997 --> 00:34:12,834
left people all over the country
shaken and demanding answers.

795
00:34:12,901 --> 00:34:15,135
In her speech, President Taylor
went a long way...

796
00:34:15,203 --> 00:34:16,136
Hey.

797
00:34:16,204 --> 00:34:17,137
Morning.

798
00:34:17,205 --> 00:34:19,139
Pour yourself
some orange juice.

799
00:34:21,643 --> 00:34:23,378
I'm not really very hungry.

800
00:34:23,445 --> 00:34:25,980
Sit down, eat
some breakfast for once.

801
00:34:26,047 --> 00:34:27,482
It's unhealthy not to.

802
00:34:27,549 --> 00:34:28,816
What are you doing up anyway?

803
00:34:28,884 --> 00:34:32,019
I, uh, ... couldn't sleep.

804
00:34:33,955 --> 00:34:36,891
Listen, uh, I want you to come
home straight after work today.

805
00:34:36,958 --> 00:34:38,726
Okay?

806
00:34:38,794 --> 00:34:40,695
No dillydallying.

807
00:34:40,763 --> 00:34:41,696
Why?

808
00:34:41,764 --> 00:34:43,898
Just in case.

809
00:34:43,965 --> 00:34:45,566
In case of what?

810
00:34:45,634 --> 00:34:48,436
These attacks, this terrorism--

811
00:34:48,504 --> 00:34:49,604
it's all over the news.

812
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:53,073
Okay, it's not a good day
to be a Muslim.

813
00:34:53,141 --> 00:34:56,176
Jibraan, Muslims had
nothing to do with it.

814
00:34:56,244 --> 00:34:58,045
Doesn't matter.

815
00:34:58,113 --> 00:35:00,481
Nobody cares, believe me.

816
00:35:00,549 --> 00:35:03,551
Most of the guys at my work
think I'm Puerto Rican anyway.

817
00:35:08,857 --> 00:35:10,324
It's about time.

818
00:35:37,386 --> 00:35:39,854
Come in.

819
00:35:39,921 --> 00:35:41,489
Excuse me, Ms. Taylor.

820
00:35:41,557 --> 00:35:42,790
What is it?

821
00:35:42,858 --> 00:35:45,460
The attorney general asked me
to check in with you.

822
00:35:45,528 --> 00:35:47,495
He is waiting
to sign off on a document

823
00:35:47,563 --> 00:35:50,131
I was told you were reviewing.

824
00:35:50,199 --> 00:35:51,533
Anyone happen to mention to you

825
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,201
what this document is about?

826
00:35:53,269 --> 00:35:54,202
No, ma'am.

827
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:57,104
No, I imagine they wouldn't.

828
00:35:57,173 --> 00:35:58,239
It's a secret,

829
00:35:58,307 --> 00:36:01,209
highly classified.

830
00:36:01,277 --> 00:36:03,344
Not that I give a damn.

831
00:36:03,412 --> 00:36:05,413
It's a get-out-of-jail-free card

832
00:36:05,481 --> 00:36:07,748
for Jonas Hodges,

833
00:36:07,816 --> 00:36:11,786
the bastard responsible
for my brother's death

834
00:36:11,853 --> 00:36:13,521
and so many others.

835
00:36:13,589 --> 00:36:15,956
I don't understand, ma'am.

836
00:36:16,024 --> 00:36:18,826
Mr. Hodges died in the hospital.

837
00:36:18,894 --> 00:36:22,430
I wish that were the case,
but no,

838
00:36:22,498 --> 00:36:26,234
and once the A.G. signs this witness
protection agreement, Hodges is going

839
00:36:26,302 --> 00:36:30,538
to live out his days in
comfort and anonymity

840
00:36:30,606 --> 00:36:34,475
while my brother lies in
his grave in Arlington Cemetery.

841
00:36:37,213 --> 00:36:39,214
Does that sound like justice
to you, Aaron?

842
00:36:39,281 --> 00:36:42,550
No, ma'am, it does not.

843
00:36:42,618 --> 00:36:44,385
And yet my mother saw fit

844
00:36:44,453 --> 00:36:47,088
to reward this monster
for his cooperation.

845
00:36:47,155 --> 00:36:49,857
Well, I'm sure it was
a difficult decision

846
00:36:49,925 --> 00:36:51,292
for the president to make.

847
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,594
Not difficult enough.

848
00:36:52,661 --> 00:36:54,295
My mother may be
able to live with it,

849
00:36:54,363 --> 00:36:57,498
but I'm not sure I can.

850
00:36:57,566 --> 00:37:04,339
Ms. Taylor, I have seen
the guilty walk free many times.

851
00:37:04,406 --> 00:37:06,374
I understand your anger
and frustration,

852
00:37:06,442 --> 00:37:09,310
and I am genuinely sorry.

853
00:37:12,848 --> 00:37:14,949
Um...

854
00:37:15,016 --> 00:37:18,586
tell the A.G. I've
reviewed the agreement

855
00:37:18,654 --> 00:37:20,555
and we can move ahead.

856
00:37:20,623 --> 00:37:23,124
Thank you, ma'am.

857
00:37:25,127 --> 00:37:28,162
Is there anything else
that I can do for you?

858
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:31,132
Other than kill Jonas Hodges, no.

859
00:37:37,273 --> 00:37:39,607
I'm sorry, Aaron.

860
00:37:39,675 --> 00:37:40,875
I didn't mean that.

861
00:37:40,942 --> 00:37:42,644
I was just venting.

862
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:46,046
Ma'am.

863
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,348
Hello?

864
00:38:21,416 --> 00:38:22,349
Martin?

865
00:38:22,417 --> 00:38:23,583
It's Olivia Taylor.

866
00:38:23,651 --> 00:38:24,584
Did I wake you?

867
00:38:24,652 --> 00:38:27,021
Well, as a matter of fact, yes.

868
00:38:27,088 --> 00:38:28,022
What time is it?

869
00:38:28,089 --> 00:38:29,456
Almost 4:00.

870
00:38:29,524 --> 00:38:31,258
Actually I didn't expect
to catch you at home.

871
00:38:31,326 --> 00:38:32,359
I thought you were
in Florida

872
00:38:32,427 --> 00:38:34,594
doing opposition
for the Gainor campaign.

873
00:38:34,662 --> 00:38:37,464
No, that didn't
really work out.

874
00:38:37,532 --> 00:38:38,866
Why not?

875
00:38:38,934 --> 00:38:41,568
Let's just say that my methods
were a little hardball

876
00:38:41,636 --> 00:38:43,770
for the governor's taste.

877
00:38:46,808 --> 00:38:49,810
So... what can I do
for you, Olivia?

878
00:38:49,878 --> 00:38:52,279
You heard about the attack
on the White House?

879
00:38:52,347 --> 00:38:55,182
Yeah, I watched your mother's
address to the nation.

880
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:56,483
Really impressive.

881
00:38:56,551 --> 00:38:59,119
She continues to
surprise, doesn't she?

882
00:38:59,187 --> 00:39:00,687
Listen, Martin,
I need your help.

883
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:01,922
Can we meet?

884
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:03,657
- Now?
- Yeah.

885
00:39:03,725 --> 00:39:06,126
Well, what's this about, Olivia?

886
00:39:06,194 --> 00:39:07,928
I can't talk about
it over the phone.

887
00:39:07,996 --> 00:39:09,796
Well, it's the middle
of the night, you know?

888
00:39:09,865 --> 00:39:11,866
Y-You got to do
better than that.

889
00:39:15,003 --> 00:39:18,805
We were in a dive hotel bar in
Atlanta right after we picked Hayworth

890
00:39:18,874 --> 00:39:20,741
to be the running mate
on the ticket.

891
00:39:20,808 --> 00:39:22,642
There was an issue
regarding his abuse

892
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:24,879
of a certain prescription drug

893
00:39:24,946 --> 00:39:27,014
and a local reporter who
couldn't be persuaded

894
00:39:27,082 --> 00:39:28,382
to shut up about it.

895
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:32,786
I remember
you turned to me and said

896
00:39:32,854 --> 00:39:33,820
there was no problem

897
00:39:33,889 --> 00:39:36,991
that couldn't be handled
or eliminated.

898
00:39:37,058 --> 00:39:39,593
Uh-huh.

899
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:42,529
Well, I was drunk.

900
00:39:42,597 --> 00:39:44,231
You were serious.

901
00:39:44,299 --> 00:39:46,800
You know, you're right.

902
00:39:46,868 --> 00:39:48,835
We shouldn't be talking
about this over the phone.

903
00:39:48,904 --> 00:39:51,038
How soon can you be
at the White House?

904
00:39:51,106 --> 00:39:52,839
How's 15 minutes sound?

905
00:39:52,908 --> 00:39:54,909
Good.

906
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:02,016
You done with that yet?

907
00:40:02,083 --> 00:40:03,583
I'm not familiar
with these commands.

908
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:06,954
Oh, you don't want to boot
the subnet with server two.

909
00:40:07,022 --> 00:40:08,688
It has a faulty bus that
we weren't able to fix

910
00:40:08,756 --> 00:40:09,823
before you guys impounded it.

911
00:40:09,891 --> 00:40:11,625
Well, maybe you'd
like to take over.

912
00:40:11,692 --> 00:40:14,594
Only if you want it to work right.

913
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:17,597
I don't like this either.

914
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:19,133
- Is there a problem?
- Yes, there is.

915
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,801
I'm not comfortable
doing this.

916
00:40:20,868 --> 00:40:22,803
I agreed to it,
but I don't like it.

917
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:24,771
What exactly aren't
you comfortable with?

918
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:27,607
Uh, well, the Bill of Rights
being violated, for one,

919
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:28,842
so if you're going
to be doing anything

920
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:29,843
grossly illegal, please...

921
00:40:29,911 --> 00:40:33,000
We'll make sure we notify you
so you can leave the building.

922
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:48,662
Hello, Big Brother.

923
00:40:48,729 --> 00:40:50,630
Look, if you think your need

924
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:53,100
to complain is more important
than the lives of the people

925
00:40:53,168 --> 00:40:55,469
that are counting on us,
go whine somewhere else!

926
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:57,438
Jack, it's okay.
No, it is not okay!

927
00:40:57,505 --> 00:41:00,507
President David Palmer
recommissioned these servers

928
00:41:00,575 --> 00:41:02,776
because he felt it was
vital to national security!

929
00:41:02,844 --> 00:41:04,845
President Palmer
made the call!

930
00:41:04,912 --> 00:41:06,713
Is that going to be
good enough for you?!

931
00:41:06,781 --> 00:41:08,182
Answer me!

932
00:41:08,249 --> 00:41:09,249
Yes.

933
00:41:32,807 --> 00:41:35,742
There's something
really wrong with him.

934
00:41:35,810 --> 00:41:37,378
He said
President Palmer.

935
00:41:37,445 --> 00:41:39,079
He meant Taylor.

936
00:41:39,147 --> 00:41:41,215
He said it twice.

937
00:42:08,009 --> 00:42:10,744
What is this now?

938
00:42:10,811 --> 00:42:11,778
Probably a fuse.

939
00:42:11,846 --> 00:42:16,750
Here, you do what
you can to finish up.

940
00:42:16,817 --> 00:42:19,353
I'm gonna go check the box.

941
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:35,936
Jibraan!

942
00:42:36,003 --> 00:42:37,404
Hamid?

943
00:42:39,006 --> 00:42:40,006
Jibra...

944
00:42:41,541 --> 00:42:43,643
Hamid?

945
00:42:47,782 --> 00:42:49,483
Keep your mouth shut
and no one gets hurt.

946
00:42:49,551 --> 00:42:51,640
- Who are you? What do you want?
- Shut up!

947
00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:53,554
What did you do to my brother?

948
00:42:53,621 --> 00:42:54,788
Hamid!
One more word,

949
00:42:54,855 --> 00:42:56,756
I put a bullet in your brain.

950
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:57,757
Understand?

951
00:42:57,825 --> 00:42:59,659
You understand?!
Yes!

952
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:07,000
