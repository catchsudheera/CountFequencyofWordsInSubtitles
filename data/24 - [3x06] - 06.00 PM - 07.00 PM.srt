00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:14,030
<i>Previously on "24":</i>

2
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,917
<i>Welcome to the first of three debates</i>

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,276
<i>between President David Palmer
and Senator John Keeler.</i>

4
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:25,390
We've just learned that the woman with whom
the president is involved, Dr Anne Packard,

5
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:29,871
is being accused of helping to fabricate
the results of a clinical drug trial.

6
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:34,033
Did the president know of these
accusations and choose to ignore them?

7
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,749
Kim, your dad's trying to break out Salazar.

8
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,037
- When did you last hear from him?
- About a half hour ago.

9
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:43,271
He asked me to issue a transfer order
for Ramón Salazar.

10
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,397
- And you did it.
- Yeah. He said Salazar needed to be moved.

11
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,155
- You're telling me this isn't true?
- Kim, I'm sorry. Your dad lied to you.

12
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:54,028
- What's gonna happen to him?
- Best way out of this is to find Kyle Singer.

13
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,838
Then your dad will give up Salazar.

14
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,998
Kyle, what are you doing?
There's no way out of here.

15
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,992
If I die, the virus is dying with me.

16
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,757
Kyle!

17
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,511
I got it. A patrol car found
the truck Kyle Singer was in.

18
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,556
<i>Pipe this in to the teams on standby.</i>

19
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,269
<i>Assume everyone on site is contagious
and use level one CDC protocol.</i>

20
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,638
If you wanna get out of this,
you're gonna have to trust me.

21
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,551
<i>- Chase!
- What are you doing, Jack?</i>

22
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:30,711
I gotta get Salazar in the air in 60 seconds
or 100,000 people will die. You choose.

23
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:35,715
This is Warden Mitchell. I want all teams
to stand down. I repeat, stand down.

24
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:41,392
Congratulations. Now you are an even
bigger enemy to your country than I am.

25
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:50,076
<i>The following takes place
between 6pm and 7pm.</i>

26
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,432
Have we enough fuel to get to Mexico?

27
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,954
- We're not going to Mexico.
- What? Why not?

28
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,794
If we try, they'll just force us down.
You're gonna have to trust me.

29
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,875
<i>- Field Ops. O'Brian.
- Chloe, it's Chase.</i>

30
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:18,157
Jack disarmed his locator,
but the military have him on radar.

31
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:22,028
They're feeding us the stream
now, Chase. I'm sending it to you.

32
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,790
<i>He just banked.
He's heading west towards downtown.</i>

33
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:34,510
Downtown? He knows they can't
shoot him down over a populated area.

34
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,797
Try to override his disabled comms
using an emergency frequency.

35
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:41,190
We have to get through
to let him know we found Kyle Singer.

36
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,315
On it.

37
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,234
Major Blanchard, this is Chappelle.
What's the status of your pursuit craft?

38
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:49,392
I have two helicopters that have
just taken off from down here.

39
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:54,838
- How quickly will they intercept?
- Bauer's no longer headed south toward us.

40
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,593
- Where's he headed?
- He's headed toward the city.

41
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,116
At his current speed,
it'll take us ten minutes to get within range.

42
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,476
You got to force him down.
Even shoot him down, if it comes to that.

43
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,269
We can't do that over the city
without serious collateral damage.

44
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:12,353
Then do it before he gets to the city.
If he lands, he'll be difficult to catch.

45
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,192
- Yes, sir.
- Keep this line open.

46
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:19,035
Michelle, I'm taking over for Tony. Division
wants a senior officer in charge of CTU.

47
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,350
Give me an update.

48
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,830
We're trying to contact the chopper.
Now the virus is contained,

49
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:28,708
we need to let Jack know
the attempted escape of Salazar is pointless.

50
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:33,920
Send the department heads to the conference
area. I want everyone on the same page.

51
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,869
- What about C-band?
- It's a SWAT chopper, they wouldn't use it.

52
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:47,876
Adam, tie up whatever you're doing. We have
a briefing in the conference area in two.

53
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,992
Kim?

54
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:55,153
- Over here.
- What do you need?

55
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:59,552
Anchor these lists for Chloe while she tries
to find an admitting channel for the chopper.

56
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,631
I'm on it.

57
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,196
I'm sorry I lost it in your dad's office.

58
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:10,159
It's OK. Did you tell Michelle
about the drugs you found in there?

59
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,708
- Yeah.
- What are they gonna do?

60
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:18,352
I don't know. Everything came in right
after that, so no one's had time to process.

61
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:22,353
- Sending you over the first two groups.
- Sure.

62
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,755
We'll attempt to communicate with Jack,
to resolve this peacefully.

63
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:38,753
But if we can't, I need everyone
absolutely clear on this.

64
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:44,278
Salazar's terrorist connections are a threat
to this country. We cannot let him leave.

65
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:49,798
Now that we've got Singer, should it come
to it, both Salazar and Bauer are expendable.

66
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:53,156
Can't we focus on options
to bring down the chopper without force?

67
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:57,119
Jack's not giving us any options.
He's on a suicide mission either way.

68
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:01,478
Once he hands Ramón off to Hector,
they'll have no use for him. They'll kill him.

69
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:05,758
I just got off the phone with Major Blanchard.
He has pursuit craft tracking Jack.

70
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,072
However, if they're not able to catch him
by the time he reaches metro airspace,

71
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,435
then we have a whole new set of problems.

72
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,080
We need to coordinate
with local authorities now.

73
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,475
- Dammit!
- Hector, relax.

74
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,838
- Why can't I reach Gael?
- Maybe he can't get away.

75
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,357
I need to know what's going on
with Ramón now.

76
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,796
The government is probably
releasing him. It's just taking time.

77
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,519
They're not releasing him.

78
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,477
- I didn't want to tell you.
- Tell me what?

79
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:01,190
The plan has changed. Jack Bauer
is the one who is going to deliver Ramón.

80
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:06,274
Jack Bauer? What is that, a joke?

81
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,513
- No.
- How is that possible?

82
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,593
Ramón would never accept help
from the man who put him in prison.

83
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,194
Oh, no. He is accepting his help.

84
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,869
Bauer is now a criminal
in his own country for doing this.

85
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,351
Hector, what's going on? How could you let
Bauer come to us? That's too dangerous.

86
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,000
- Don't worry about it, Claudia.
- No, I am worried!

87
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,311
Look what he's already done to us.
It's some kind of trick.

88
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:39,518
Don't worry about Jack Bauer.
I have plans for him.

89
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,597
<i>Yes?</i>

90
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,877
I don't have a lot of time.
We're in the middle of this.

91
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,518
Is Ramón alive?

92
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,115
Yes. He and Bauer
have escaped in a helicopter.

93
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,317
- Have they contacted our pilot?
- No. They're being pursued.

94
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,039
Everything will be decided
in the next few minutes.

95
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,395
Hey.

96
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,916
What did Chappelle say in the briefing?

97
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,753
He said a lot of stuff.

98
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,115
Are they gonna try
and shoot down my father?

99
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:29,230
If they have to. But if they can contact him it
won't come to that. Chloe, where are you at?

100
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:32,915
No progress on the hailing frequency.
We can't get through to Jack.

101
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,471
I've some new ones to try. Use a tree search.
We've got to get through to that chopper.

102
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,630
- Kim?
- Yeah?

103
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,439
- I need to speak to you.
- Sure.

104
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:56,956
Ryan and I feel you shouldn't be here until
the situation with your father is resolved.

105
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:01,670
- I'm qualified to handle the work.
- Your qualifications aren't at issue.

106
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:06,436
- Your emotions are.
- I can control my emotions.

107
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:12,038
My father's doing this to stop the virus. If he
knows we have Singer, he'll return Salazar.

108
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,190
I know, but we can't reach your father.

109
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:18,910
Not yet, but Chloe and Adam are
getting there. And I can help them.

110
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,468
I'm a resource, Michelle. Don't do this.

111
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,752
OK, go back and help Adam.

112
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:36,317
If we have to fire on that chopper,
I want her out of here.

113
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,999
- What's going on?
- It's military.

114
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,389
- How can you tell?
- Their formation and speed.

115
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,552
- They'll be on us in three to four minutes.
- And then what?

116
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,712
I assume they've got orders
to shoot us out of the sky.

117
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,396
<i>- Chappelle.
- I just called CTU.</i>

118
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,109
- They said you authorized the use of force.
- That's right, Chase, I did.

119
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,156
<i>Does President Palmer
know about this?</i>

120
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:25,438
Palmer? First of all,
he's in the middle of a national debate.

121
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:29,798
And I don't need his realized. Bauer
helped Ramón Salazar break out of prison.

122
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,440
To stop Salazar's people releasing this virus.

123
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,717
I don't care. Look, this is my jurisdiction.

124
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:40,032
All I'm saying is that getting Palmer's
realized might be the smart play here.

125
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,556
Think about it. Bauer has
a personal relationship with the president.

126
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:48,350
He's saved his life more than once, and
Palmer has interceded on his behalf before.

127
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:53,275
Our mandate does not bend to
accommodate personal relationships.

128
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,911
You're right. After you shoot Jack down, you
can personally explain that to the president.

129
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,473
<i>Chappelle.</i>

130
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,348
Our aircraft are about to make contact
with Bauer. We can be ready to fire...

131
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:17,912
Do not fire. Repeat, do not fire
until you hear back from me.

132
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:24,878
The president has spoken of his support
for the American worker,

133
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:29,988
but I'm sure these words sound hollow
to Armando Rodriguez of Galveston,

134
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:34,437
to Shawnda Brown of Biloxi,
to Kendall Taylor of Tampa,

135
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:38,832
and to 100,000 of their fellow workers
who have lost their jobs

136
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:42,390
because of trade agreements
signed by President David Palmer.

137
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:48,913
<i>It's my belief that opportunities were missed.</i>

138
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,390
- Wayne Palmer.
- Mr Palmer, Ryan Chappelle calling.

139
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,914
Mr Chappelle,
what's the latest on the bio threat?

140
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,233
Kyle Singer, who we believe to be
the only carrier of the virus, is in custody.

141
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,754
So there's no risk
of this virus being released?

142
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,957
- That's what I'm saying.
- Oh, thank God.

143
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:10,477
- Yes. We still have the Bauer situation.
- What's the status?

144
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,677
Bauer has taken Salazar
from the prison in a helicopter.

145
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,399
We have him in our sights
but can't communicate.

146
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,632
- What are you planning on doing?
- We can't allow Salazar to leave the country.

147
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,598
I'm afraid our only alternative
is to shoot him down.

148
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,558
Mr Chappelle, my brother
is not gonna like that.

149
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:31,760
That's why I'm calling. I don't wanna fire
on Bauer without the president's permission.

150
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:36,391
The president is in the middle of a televised
debate right now. This is gonna have to wait.

151
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,519
In a few minutes, their helicopter
is going to be over downtown LA.

152
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:45,390
We'll be unable to shoot it down without
risking significant civilian casualties.

153
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,789
<i>- Let me get back to you, Ryan.
- Soon, Mr Palmer.</i>

154
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:52,670
Otherwise Bauer will land that chopper and
disappear with Salazar into the population.

155
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,830
Yeah.

156
00:11:54,920 --> 00:12:01,393
<i> Economic experts predict that those
jobs will be regained and more will be created.</i>

157
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:04,836
<i>-  Senator Keeler.
-  Whose economic experts?</i>

158
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:10,756
The administration's? I, for one,
cannot accept the blurred numbers

159
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:17,518
projected by the so-called economic experts
of this administration. Those are the people...

160
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,717
<i> David, it's me.
The bio threat's been eliminated.</i>

161
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,554
We have Kyle Singer in custody.
However, Jack Bauer doesn't know this.

162
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:29,953
He's facilitated Salazar's escape and they're
in a chopper on the outskirts of the city.

163
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,190
Listen to me carefully, David.

164
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:35,113
It may be necessary to shoot him down.

165
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:39,553
<i> I would like to hear the
president's answer to that question.</i>

166
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,995
<i> Are you prepared to authorize this?</i>

167
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:46,596
<i> Mr President, your response?</i>

168
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,672
Come on, David. What do you wanna do?

169
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:55,396
<i> I think the entire American
workforce would like to hear his answer.</i>

170
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:59,951
<i>-  Mr President?
- My fellow Americans,</i>

171
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:05,239
I have been informed of a national emergency
that requires my immediate attention.

172
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:09,552
Therefore I must withdraw from this debate.

173
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,631
Excuse me.

174
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:17,550
<i>- Now what is this?
-  This is, to say the least, unusual.</i>

175
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:20,677
<i>No one here is sure what this emergency is...</i>

176
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,274
I need this room clear.

177
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,033
Get these people out of here!

178
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,192
<i> Hey!</i>

179
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,597
Where are you guys taking me?

180
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,671
Where are you taking me?

181
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,911
Why won't you talk to me?

182
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,560
Hey! Hey!

183
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,352
Help!

184
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,470
Hey, where you going?
Where you going?

185
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,796
Hey!

186
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,280
What's goin' on?

187
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,637
- Talk to me, please!
- I'm Dr Duncan. I need you to calm down.

188
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,998
- Where's my girlfriend? Where's Linda?
- We have her in another part of the facility.

189
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,116
- Is she OK?
- Yes, she's fine.

190
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,794
There's an incubation period of 14 hours.

191
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:41,034
With this virus, if you haven't become
symptomatic, you haven't transmitted it.

192
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,510
But what about my parents?
Are they going to be OK too?

193
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,435
Yeah, they're on their way.

194
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:58,998
What happens when I do become...
symptomatic?

195
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:06,471
It's like that Ebola thing, isn't it?

196
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,518
It's gonna eat me alive.

197
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,230
We'll keep you as comfortable as possible.

198
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,279
<i> Alpha One,
Zebra One. We have visual.</i>

199
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,910
They've locked onto our heat signature.

200
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,831
- Why aren't they firing?
- I don't know.

201
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,628
Chloe, come on,
give me the hailing frequency.

202
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,518
I can't make the servers go any faster, OK?

203
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:57,830
<i> We've locked onto the chopper.
It is not yet over a populated zone.</i>

204
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:02,198
<i>- I need an answer.
- How much time do we have, precisely?</i>

205
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:06,831
Before collateral damage becomes an issue,
just over four minutes.

206
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:10,435
Stay on course, Major. I'm waiting
to hear back from the president.

207
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:14,798
<i>We still haven't gotten any indication
as to the nature of this national emergency.</i>

208
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:20,591
<i>Senator Keeler's staff is questioning
whether or not this emergency actually exists.</i>

209
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,877
<i>If this indeed is
a national emergency of any sort,</i>

210
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:27,111
<i>something to challenge the nation
at this critical time,</i>

211
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:31,830
<i>it would be an odd thing, but nonetheless
something that should be taken seriously.</i>

212
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:38,473
<i>And so tonight everyone on both sides
of the aisle is beginning to tread lightly...</i>

213
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,633
<i>- Could you give us a moment, please?
- ... veracity to the president's claim.</i>

214
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,110
<i> Any speculation
as to what the emergency might be?</i>

215
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:51,194
<i> The auditorium was a buzz
with speculation of all sorts...</i>

216
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:59,191
David, I'm sorry,
but we don't have a lot of time.

217
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:03,159
So what do you want to do
about shooting down this chopper?

218
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:07,631
- I can't order them to kill Bauer.
- You can't let Salazar go either.

219
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,433
Is it Salazar you're worried about?

220
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:15,876
Or are you worried
Bauer will talk about our arrangement?

221
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:20,112
It's a fair question. To be blunt, yeah,
I am worried about that. Even if you're not.

222
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:23,636
But you still have to think about
national security, David.

223
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:27,793
Salazar not only runs a drug cartel,
he's connected to terrorist organizations.

224
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:33,557
And he has proven he has the infrastructure
to launch a biological attack on our soil.

225
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,631
We can't allow him to do that again.

226
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,712
Jack Bauer sacrificed everything
to prevent that attack.

227
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:42,156
Jack Bauer volunteered.
Jack Bauer knew the risks.

228
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:47,519
David, you have got to make this decision
as if it wasn't Jack Bauer on that helicopter.

229
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,990
You have to do what's right
for this country, David.

230
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:59,114
Listen, this is your call.

231
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,998
But you gotta make it now.

232
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:10,711
Get me Chappelle.

233
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:15,237
<i>We have just over one minute...</i>

234
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,754
Hold on, Major.

235
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,513
<i>- Ryan Chappelle.
- This is President Palmer.</i>

236
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,034
Can't you force down that chopper
without firing?

237
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,317
Bauer won't communicate with us.
He's forcing our hand.

238
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:31,349
- How much time do we have?
- In 60 seconds he'll be out of reach.

239
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,395
Sir?

240
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,591
<i>- You have my realized to fire.
- Yes, sir.</i>

241
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,352
- Major, shoot him down.
- Yes, sir.

242
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:47,956
Alpha One to Zebra One and Zebra Two.
You have a go. I repeat, you have a go.

243
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,508
<i> Roger that. Preparing to launch.</i>

244
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:59,554
- Dammit, what's happening?
- They gave the order.

245
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,392
No. Please.

246
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,993
<i> He's diving. I don't have a shot.</i>

247
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,799
<i> He's changing course.
Get under him.</i>

248
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,916
<i> Do you have a shot?</i>

249
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,879
<i> Negative. He knows we're
on him, and he's maneuvering away.</i>

250
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:19,111
<i>-  Rockets engaged.
- You're clear for shot.</i>

251
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,318
<i>-  Target locked. I'm taking the shot.
-  Hold fire. Stand by.</i>

252
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,790
<i>Alpha One, he's reached downtown corridor.
Should we still fire?</i>

253
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,998
No. Stand down.
I repeat, do not fire. Do not fire.

254
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,469
<i> Roger that,
Alpha One. Standing down.</i>

255
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,629
We're going in.

256
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:40,435
All right. Everyone, fall back to B protocols.

257
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,670
Have all units on the ground prepared.

258
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,399
Wherever Bauer lands,
I want to be on top of him.

259
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:50,554
<i> I'm coming up behind.
Stay with him. He's heading to the southeast.</i>

260
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,998
<i>He's dogging.</i>

261
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:54,876
<i>Dessler.</i>

262
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,350
- What's going on?
- They're not firing. Jack's over the city.

263
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:01,876
- Can you get him on the hailing frequency?
- Chloe's getting close.

264
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:16,592
- OK, he's putting it down. I've gotta go.
- Whoa, whoa. Get me to Chloe.

265
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:19,319
<i>Yeah?</i>

266
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,876
Chloe? Chloe?

267
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:25,669
- Any second now, Chase.
- I need to get through to him before he lands.

268
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:41,156
I've got it, Chase.
Patching you through. You're in. Go.

269
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,310
Jack? We found Kyle Singer.

270
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:48,428
<i>I repeat, we found Kyle Singer. The virus is
contained. There's no need for you to do this.</i>

271
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:15,113
<i> Area four, full quarantine.</i>

272
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,430
Mr and Mrs Singer, I'm Dr Duncan.

273
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,033
- Hi.
- Hello.

274
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:25,678
<i> One more second.
That's good. Get these.</i>

275
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,672
<i>... but our options
for treatment are limited.</i>

276
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:34,232
I don't understand. If he's not sick yet,
why isn't there any way to treat him?

277
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:40,316
Once someone's exposed and is incubating
the virus, there's nothing we can do.

278
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:47,350
- Well, how long does he have?
- The lab tests haven't come back yet...

279
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,670
Please, just give me some idea.

280
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,953
Hours, not days.

281
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,349
I'm sorry.

282
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,957
- Can we see him?
- Of course.

283
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,873
- Come on, hon.
- No, I can't. I can't!

284
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:19,272
Hey, Helen, he needs to know
that we're not angry with him.

285
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,759
OK?

286
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,108
<i> Almost done.</i>

287
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:39,237
Kyle, your parents would like
to speak with you.

288
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,512
They can hear you through the intercom.

289
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,192
Take your time. I'll be just outside.

290
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,276
- Baby.
- The Doctor told us everything.

291
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,477
But maybe they're wrong.

292
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:10,075
Maybe it isn't as bad as they think.

293
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:13,869
They're not wrong.

294
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:18,192
- I deserve what I'm getting.
- Don't say that.

295
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:23,513
All you deserved was a father
who could do better for you,

296
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:28,674
so you wouldn't have to get money
and bring it home because I couldn't.

297
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,035
No.

298
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:36,830
I'm sorry. Kyle, I'm so sorry.

299
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,555
I love you.

300
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,072
You've always taken care of me.

301
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,554
Now, I never...

302
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,189
Now, I never told you this,

303
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:01,829
but you made me feel safe.

304
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:04,229
Even now,

305
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,914
you make me feel safe.

306
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,272
You did the best you could, Dad.

307
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,873
- I don't wanna die.
- No, no.

308
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:50,155
- Edmunds, CTU. Anybody seen 'em?
- They ran into the station five minutes ago.

309
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,357
- How many trains have left?
- Two. One stopped ten blocks east.

310
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,910
Officers are searching that area.
We stopped the other train here.

311
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,198
- Jack won't let himself get trapped on a train.
- You think he's still in the tunnel?

312
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,599
<i>- CTU. Bauer.
- Kim.</i>

313
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:06,719
- I need MTA schematics of Pershing Square.
- What's going on?

314
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:10,873
Your dad got out of the chopper.
He and Salazar are on the run.

315
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,678
I've got the schematics.

316
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:16,799
How many tunnel emergency exits
are there between here and Grant?

317
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,359
- Kim?
- I'm looking.

318
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,919
Come on, let's go!

319
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,391
There's one. In the alley just off
Sixth Street. Southwest corner.

320
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,914
- How far is that from here?
- One block.

321
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,117
- All one-ways. You're better off on foot.
- I'll get back to you.

322
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:33,590
Hey, are we coordinating
with you guys or not?

323
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:02,470
- I just spoke to Chase at the metro station.
- What did he want?

324
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,711
- Plans of the subways.
- Copy them to our other agents.

325
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,791
- I did.
- Good.

326
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,671
They know not to use lethal force, right?

327
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:16,275
Mandate's the same.
Stop Salazar by any means necessary.

328
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,994
But now that they're on the ground, they can
probably do that without harming your father.

329
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,433
Right.

330
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,071
<i>- Dessler.
- Michelle, it's Chase.</i>

331
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:52,755
Jack got out through a maintenance access
off Mission.

332
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:55,798
Redeploy all your people here.
Seal off a ten-block radius.

333
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,233
I'm on it.

334
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,231
Come on, get in.

335
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,959
<i>The exit of the president did come
at a critical time in the debate,</i>

336
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:53,559
<i>and even pundits on both sides of the aisle
are speculating that it is odd to say the least...</i>

337
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:58,111
Yeah, I will. I'll tell him. Thanks.

338
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,391
That was CTU.
They still haven't found Bauer or Salazar.

339
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,871
LAPD's placing a net around the area
where the chopper landed.

340
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,633
Hopefully they'll be picked up
without incident.

341
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:16,714
Yeah. Yeah, it's probably
more likely that Bauer slipped through.

342
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:21,635
David, listen. You're gonna have to stop
thinking about his welfare for the moment.

343
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:25,713
Bauer breaking Salazar out of prison
has already leaked to the press.

344
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:29,998
You're gonna have to explain to them
that's why you ended this debate.

345
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,390
And then explicitly denounce what Bauer did.

346
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,871
So Jack puts his life on the line to stop
the virus, and we hang him out to dry.

347
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:43,078
David, we cannot allow anyone to know
that we sanctioned what he did.

348
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:46,232
That would do irreparable damage
to you, to the office...

349
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,710
Now, you know what I'm saying is true.

350
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,553
I'm sorry. You're gonna have to let him go.

351
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,317
- Who are you calling?
- Your pilot.

352
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:21,551
Your brother gave the FBI
contact instructions in his last call.

353
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:24,154
He's got a plane circling,
waiting to pick you up.

354
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,357
So CTU knows about the plane?
Won't that be a problem?

355
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,192
Not for long.

356
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,478
<i>- Yes?
- This is Jack Bauer. I've got Salazar.</i>

357
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:42,716
I'm on a secure cell. 7-1-1-star-6-5-5-9.
Reconfigure your frequency and call me back.

358
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:46,429
- If I get confirmation.
- That's right.

359
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:51,435
- Is this the real thing?
- Yes. He's got Salazar. Call him back.

360
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:55,229
- And we're buffered from CTU?
- It's handled.

361
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:01,394
<i>- Yeah?
-  Where are you?</i>

362
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,517
2700 block of Figueroa.
We're headed south.

363
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:09,957
The closest safe airstrip is Santa Margarita.
Do you know where that is?

364
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:13,510
Yeah, I can get there in about ten minutes.

365
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:17,273
You really are the best, Jack.

366
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:22,354
When you were down there with us,
I had no idea you were an agent.

367
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:27,434
We accepted you. You didn't
have to put the needle in your arm.

368
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:33,595
You did that for other reasons.
Same reason as all junkies. To kill the pain.

369
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,200
What's your pain, Jack?

370
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:40,158
What does the needle make go away, huh?

371
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:54,194
<i>- Tell Division to move their men.
-  Same place?</i>

372
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:58,034
<i>- Yeah, we need everyone downtown.
-  Dr Linzer on line three.</i>

373
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:02,636
<i>-  it'll take a few minutes.
- Yeah, call me back with confirmation.</i>

374
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:06,996
<i>- Yeah, Doctor?
- Well, your husband's out of surgery.</i>

375
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,389
- How is he?
- There was no nerve damage.

376
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,391
The injury was entirely vascular.

377
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:17,749
- And that's what we were hoping for, right?
- Yes, he should recover fully.

378
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,313
Oh, thank God.

379
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:26,110
He's going into post-op now,
so he should be awake in the next hour or so.

380
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:31,432
I'll be there. Thank you.
Thank you, Doctor.

381
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,238
<i>Thanks.</i>

382
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,509
That was the hospital.

383
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,309
Tony's gonna be OK.

384
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:55,788
- That's good news.
- Thank you, Ryan.

385
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:58,758
Have you heard back from INS?

386
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:04,233
Yeah, we sent out an alert,
and we're covered from Baja to New Mexico.

387
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,754
How about local airfields?

388
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:10,276
We're trying to stop everything
but we're bogged down with the FAA.

389
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:15,036
Have Gael run a pattern analysis on local
air traffic. We may come up with an anomaly.

390
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,315
That's a good idea.

391
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,435
- Kaufman.
- Adam, where's Gael?

392
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:32,717
Um, Tech One. Kim and I
are just about to head down there.

393
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:36,031
- Do you need me to tell him something?
- Just send him to my office.

394
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:39,237
- OK, I'll let him know.
- Thanks.

395
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:51,074
Once you get back in the air, I'll be offline.
Increment your frequency every 15 minutes.

396
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:54,436
<i>- I'll pick you up on 22-7.
-  Roger that.</i>

397
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,794
I'll get back to you.

398
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:09,549
<i> Everything on the system
hasn't been updated since 11am.</i>

399
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:12,393
<i>- That's where you should start.
-  Got it.</i>

400
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,278
Gael? Michelle needs to see you in her office.

401
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,590
OK.

402
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:20,194
- You can use this station.
- What's she doing?

403
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:23,590
Updating the logs.
We got behind when everything hit the fan.

404
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:26,911
I can do that a lot faster than she can.

405
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,468
No, Michelle needs to see you now.

406
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,513
- OK, you're all set.
- Great.

407
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,909
- See you in a bit.
- Yup.

408
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,677
<i> Sir?</i>

409
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:10,708
- Can you give me a moment?
- Yeah.

410
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:17,510
I want these two paragraphs inverted. And
have the secretary meet me in the morning.

411
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,428
- All right?
- Yes, sir.

412
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,594
Is everything OK?

413
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:29,912
We had to make some fast choices,
and I couldn't do that while I was on stage.

414
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,117
Yes, everything's OK now.

415
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,430
Are you sure?

416
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,796
- This is just damage control.
- David, I'm sorry.

417
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:43,351
I still can't believe Keeler would
repeat those lies in a national debate.

418
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:47,149
You don't have to apologize for anything.
We didn't sink to their level.

419
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:50,516
And in the long run, it's gonna pay off.

420
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:54,479
- I hope you're right.
- But I'm more concerned about you.

421
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,677
You've only been brought into this
because of me.

422
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:02,869
- I'm fine.
- Yes, you are.

423
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:11,514
David, Jerry scheduled a press conference.
They're expecting a statement this evening.

424
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,477
- Fine.
- Good.

425
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:17,872
- We need a response to Keeler's accusation.
- What did the quick polls tell us?

426
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:24,399
We got hit hard. Voters who were on the fence
may have just fallen into Keeler's camp.

427
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,675
Once they find out Ted was lying...

428
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:30,799
And how are they supposed to do that, Anne?
It's he-said-she-said.

429
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:34,395
This is politics. It's not medicine.
Do me a favor and stay out of it.

430
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:39,076
<i>- "Stay out of it"? I am it.
- That's enough.</i>

431
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:47,112
Be patient. Anne's not going anywhere,
and we're not changing our strategy.

432
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:52,512
- David, we need to talk...
- Right now, it's "Mr President".

433
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,000
Yes sir, Mr President.

434
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:14,472
I may not agree with his bedside
manner, but I think he's right.

435
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:18,439
- You don't need this right now.
- What are you saying?

436
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:21,830
We should put our relationship on hold
until after the election.

437
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:27,472
First of all, that won't resolve anything.
And second of all, I need you.

438
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:34,190
Then I'm right here.

439
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:37,192
That's my lady.

440
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:47,994
<i>-  And the third series?
-  Yeah, he'll be isolated.</i>

441
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:53,628
Wait a minute.

442
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,393
How can that be?

443
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,755
- Have we checked these results?
- Three times.

444
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:01,115
- You're sure?
- Very sure.

445
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,350
OK. Thanks.

446
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:16,157
Yeah, get me Chappelle at CTU.
Put him through to my cell.

447
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,954
What's going on?

448
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:40,476
There's no trace of the virus in your blood.

449
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,549
What?

450
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:46,919
We reran the tests several times and had them
double-checked at another lab. You're clean.

451
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,357
My God!

452
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:01,078
- Duncan.
- Nicole. Chappelle.

453
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:04,516
- Kyle Singer's tests came back negative.
- How is that possible?

454
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:07,319
It's only possible if he was never infected.

455
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:10,392
You're telling me this whole
virus scare was a bluff?

456
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:14,519
I don't know if I'd say that.
That dead body this morning was infected.

457
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:18,479
Then why wouldn't they have infected
the boy? What the hell is going on here?

458
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:21,120
I don't know. You tell me.

459
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:34,911
- What the hell's going on?
- You didn't think I'd let you just leave?

460
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,036
- Get him out.
- Ramón!

461
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:40,476
What the hell is going on? Ramón!

462
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,508
- Thanks for the ride, Jack.
- Ramón!

463
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:54,797
Hector said to bring him back. Alive.

464
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,873
Fine. Let's go.

465
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,277
Adam!

466
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,635
Adam, there's something seriously wrong...

467
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:57,879
I just remembered.

468
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,912
I forgot to close that file.
