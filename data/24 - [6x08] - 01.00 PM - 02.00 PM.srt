1
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,119
Call the cabinet in for a session.
We are ramping up.

2
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,919
Congratulations, Tom,
it's an excellent plan.

3
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:25,390
- It's time someone stood up to these people.
- Thank you very much, Mr Vice President.

4
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:32,079
The American Muslim community is our best
line of defence against these terrorists.

5
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,711
Your plan would only hinder the efforts
of law enforcement to stop Fayed.

6
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,112
I remain convinced that implementing
this plan would be a terrible mistake.

7
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:46,190
15 minutes ago the NSA picked up
a conversation between McCarthy and Fayed.

8
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,238
McCarthy's found another engineer
to arm the four nukes.

9
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,880
<i>(Chloe) Oh, my God. It's Morris.</i>

10
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,476
<i>(Jack) Morris, it's a setup.
The engineer McCarthy's looking for is you.</i>

11
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,198
Get out of the car.

12
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,953
<i>- (McCarthy) We're on our way.
- We'll be waiting.</i>

13
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:05,113
- With my money.
- You'll get paid when I have what I want.

14
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,592
I'm just delivering him.
You'll have to make him cooperate.

15
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,069
How do I find McCarthy?

16
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,833
- Four ccs.
- His vitals are spiking across the line.

17
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,559
- Four ccs!
- Jack, don't!

18
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,074
This has nothing to do with McCarthy.

19
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:22,038
- It has to do with Palmer.
- David Palmer?

20
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,793
I gave the order for his assassination.

21
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:30,396
He was responsible for Palmer's
assassination. He directed the conspiracy.

22
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,630
He was trying to protect my father's company.

23
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,110
- You told him about Palmer.
- I had to make him think I cracked.

24
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,397
But I kept you out of it.
Dad, stick to the plan.

25
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,517
Sometimes you have to make adjustments.

26
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,233
My son's had a seizure!

27
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:55,518
If you people killed my son,
you're gonna regret it for the rest of your life.

28
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:10,750
I'm en route to the ambush site.
Which direction did they take Morris?

29
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,718
I'm bringing it up.
What are they gonna do to him?

30
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,872
They have to keep him alive
to make the bombs operational.

31
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,873
That means we've got time.
Remain calm and pull up the satellite now.

32
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,871
The server's not responding.

33
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:26,270
- You're not re-synching the coordinates.
- I know what I'm doing.

34
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,514
- You confirmed this with the field team?
- Yes.

35
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,431
Jack's on line one.

36
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:57,359
It's Bill. We just got word from the field team
at your brother's house. Graem's dead, Jack.

37
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,433
<i>- What happened?
- We'll know more after an autopsy.</i>

38
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,715
All signs point to cardiac arrest.

39
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,428
- Because of the interrogation?
- The medic on site believes that was a factor.

40
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,080
- Does my father know?
- Yes, he was there.

41
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:18,039
Your sister-in-law and nephew
were en route to CTU when it happened.

42
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,396
I'd appreciate it
if you'd break the news to them.

43
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,356
Of course.

44
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,758
- Sir?
- Stand by.

45
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,553
Chloe's starting to screw up.
She's worried about Morris.

46
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,915
I think she's losing it.

47
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,634
- Chloe, do we have access to the uplink yet?
- Not yet.

48
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,314
I know what you're feeling.
If there's a problem...

49
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,552
Get away! The only problem is people
bothering me when I'm trying to do my job.

50
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,598
- Give up the post to Milo.
- Leave me alone. I can do this.

51
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,669
Now.

52
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,115
Fine.

53
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:06,873
Jack, I've relieved Chloe. She's too distraught.
You're on with Milo.

54
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,871
Jack, just give me a second.

55
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:18,512
I got McCarthy on satellite 13 minutes ago
abducting Morris in a silver Maserati

56
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,559
at the corner of Central and 3rd.
I'm tracking them.

57
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,712
Right now McCarthy's
at Adams and 13th heading west.

58
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,995
We should have a visual in a few minutes.

59
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:32,117
How long will it take the TAC teams
to intercept McCarthy?

60
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,191
<i>I don't know.
We'll get back to you.</i>

61
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,431
Where are we taking him?

62
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,592
Fayed will call soon.
Just relax and drive.

63
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:48,355
I am relaxed.
I just wanna get this over with.

64
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:51,955
It will never be over. CTU knows
who you are. They're looking for you.

65
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,076
- Shut up.
- Is that possible?

66
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,479
He's bluffing.

67
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:00,554
So you're not Darren McCarthy, arms dealer,
subcontracted by BXJ Technologies?

68
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:04,110
CTU intercepted a transmission
about Fayed hiring you to do this.

69
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,316
- I said shut up!
- Fine.

70
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:11,074
We'll hand him over to Fayed as planned.
If I'm already a marked man,

71
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,799
- I might as well get paid for it.
- What about me?

72
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:19,193
He didn't say they know about you.
And anyway, I'll take care of you, like always.

73
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,838
<i>(helicopter)</i>

74
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,950
A chopper. That's a chopper.

75
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,750
I got him. We got a visual.

76
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,079
- Turn left.
- Why?

77
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,390
Just do what I say. Just do it.

78
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,993
Swing back.

79
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,674
<i>They just took off.
They must've spotted us.</i>

80
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,513
All right,
I got them turning north onto Anders.

81
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,798
- Go around them.
- No!

82
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,438
- Go around them!
- I can't!

83
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,476
Just do it!

84
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,189
<i>(horn honks)</i>

85
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,751
- Oh, my God.
- Go left.

86
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,435
<i>(horn honks)</i>

87
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,712
- Are they still there?
- Yes.

88
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,791
Turn there.

89
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,633
We got a problem.
They're headed to the 110 interchange.

90
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:56,070
We lost 'em. Does Caltrans
have cameras covering that area?

91
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,798
Nothing. The TAC team
is still five minutes away.

92
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,711
Captain, put me down now.

93
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,828
Do you know what this is about?

94
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,309
Fayed, who you're taking me to, is
the terrorist who set off the bomb in Valencia.

95
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,439
He has four more bombs,
but he needs me to make them work

96
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,990
so that he can kill
tens of thousands of innocent people.

97
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:41,200
And all you have to do
to stop that from happening is to uncuff me.

98
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:46,111
McCarthy's right.
CTU doesn't know you exist.

99
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:52,199
For the love of God,
all of those people's lives are on you.

100
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,754
Let's go. Come on.

101
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,431
Move it, move it.

102
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,272
- This way.
- Can I get my luggage?

103
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,635
Forget about the luggage! Come on.

104
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:48,033
You did not tell me
this was about nuclear bombs.

105
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:52,716
What this is about is about seven
million dollars. Now get in the truck!

106
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:25,193
<i>- Pressman.
- They must've switched vehicles.</i>

107
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,909
They could've merged onto
any of six local roads or highways.

108
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,468
We can't track them
without knowing the car.

109
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:35,951
Dammit, Milo! They could be anywhere.
Just find them and get back to me.

110
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,790
Head south.

111
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,869
I'm sorry.

112
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,875
<i>- (phone rings)
- Hello?</i>

113
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:02,669
I have a new place to meet.
Are you certain you're not being followed?

114
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,239
Yeah. What's the address?

115
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:09,235
4332 Florence Avenue, apartment 621.

116
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,678
- You got my money?
- Yes.

117
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,638
OK, turn on the GPS.

118
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,679
- Apartment 621, all right? Don't forget it.
- Mm-hm.

119
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:40,080
OK, good. It's not too far.

120
00:10:55,880 --> 00:11:00,954
Yes, yes! Thank God.
A bit excessive, but you did the right thing.

121
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:05,113
- I've got to contact CTU...
- Shut up! Shut up!

122
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:12,516
Fayed wants you alive and whatever shape
you're in beyond that is up to you.

123
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:19,830
- Oh, come on. What are you doing?
- I am making seven million dollars.

124
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:24,710
And I can spend it
without having to worry about CTU.

125
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,075
Like you said, they don't know I exist.

126
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:49,352
Listen, I know you think I'm wrong

127
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,989
and that I blindsided you
by not backing your proposals.

128
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:56,356
Correct on both counts, sir.

129
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:02,072
Tom, I have always valued your counsel.
Ever since you showed up at my home

130
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,357
and convinced me to run,
spearheaded my campaign...

131
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,673
I mean, if it weren't for you,
I wouldn't be here.

132
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:15,190
But I hope I can still count on you
to help me implement my policies.

133
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:19,114
Excuse me, Mr President,
the plane carrying Hamri Al-Assad

134
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,636
has landed at Andrews Air Force Base.
He'll be here soon.

135
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,790
- Thank you.
- Yes, sir.

136
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,075
We'll talk later?

137
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,829
<i>- (knocking)
- (man) Mr Lennox?</i>

138
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,036
Everything's OK.
We're fine in here. Thank you.

139
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,314
What happened?

140
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:59,633
The presidentjust rejected every one of my
proposals right there in front of the cabinet.

141
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:03,633
Not only has he changed his mind
on the internment plan,

142
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:07,349
he is rolling back on the
detention facilities already in place.

143
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,273
- I thought he was on board.
- Well, so did I!

144
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:15,032
Now he's putting forth his own agenda
to appease the Muslim population.

145
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,112
He's hoping they'll
help find the nuclear weapons?

146
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:23,479
That's it! That's it! And all he will succeed
in doing is to prove to the terrorists

147
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:27,872
that he does not have the stomach
to do what is necessary and inevitable!

148
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:31,873
OK, then you need to use your influence
to change his mind.

149
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:35,191
My... My influence?

150
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:39,592
You don't get it, do you, Reed?
I have no influence!

151
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:44,117
Not here. Not in this administration.

152
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,118
- No, I'm resigning.
- Sir, that would be a terrible mistake.

153
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:55,193
My mistake was to believe that Wayne Palmer

154
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:58,716
has the courage and the vision
to fill this office.

155
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,713
Clearly, I overestimated him.
He is certainly not his brother.

156
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,678
Which makes it
all the more important that you stay.

157
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:10,993
You have the support of many people here,
the least of which is the vice president.

158
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:14,390
Unfortunately,
the vice president is not the one in power.

159
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:19,156
And this country is being led to slaughter
by the man who is.

160
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,798
No. Unh-unh. Unh-unh.

161
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,031
I cannot in good conscience
be party to this. I can't.

162
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:27,908
- This is a terrible mistake.
- I can't talk about this any further.

163
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:34,314
Go now and draft my letter of resignation
and bring it back to me now for me to sign.

164
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,636
Yes, sir.

165
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,878
<i>- (Carson) Yes?
- It's Reed.</i>

166
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:53,398
Palmerjust shot down the Lennox plan in
a cabinet meeting, rejecting every initiative.

167
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,871
<i>- Did you hear what I said?
- I heard.</i>

168
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,838
We have to move ahead
with what we talked about.

169
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,114
I realise it's extreme,
but I don't see any alternative. Do you?

170
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,590
No, but there's a problem.
Tom Lennox is resigning.

171
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,392
- When?
- As soon as I write his letter of resignation.

172
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,393
Carson, if he goes,
I lose my job and I lose my access.

173
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,314
Our plan is contingent on your proximity
to the president. We need you in place.

174
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:25,235
I know. I am very well aware of that,
but Tom Lennox is determined to quit.

175
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,595
He might reconsider
if he knew what was coming.

176
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,229
- I suppose I could feel him out.
- Then do it. Carefully.

177
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,788
<i>We have to protect ourselves.</i>

178
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,637
Anything come up on Caltrans?

179
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:48,271
Without knowing what car he switched into,
it'll take hours to go through the frame grabs.

180
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:51,352
Stay on it. Right now it's all we've got.

181
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,031
- Mrs Bauer?
- Yes?

182
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:59,557
I'm Bill Buchanan, Director of Operations.
You must be Josh.

183
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:06,239
- May I speak with you a moment, privately?
- Um...

184
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,389
It's OK, Mom.

185
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,511
OK.

186
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,589
What is it?

187
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:27,276
I'm very sorry to have to tell you this.
Your husband is dead.

188
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:33,716
- How?
- He appears to have suffered a heart attack.

189
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:39,038
- What did Jack do to him?
- There'll be a thorough investigation.

190
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,476
Your father-in-law is accompanying
Graem's body for an autopsy.

191
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,916
- Unless you have an objection?
- No.

192
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,637
- I have to tell my son.
- Of course.

193
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,191
Josh.

194
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:05,308
Your mother wants to speak with you.

195
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,992
<i>(Josh) What? No. No.</i>

196
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,435
<i>- (phone rings)
- Pressman.</i>

197
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:25,354
- It's Jack. Let me speak to Buchanan.
- Hold on. Jack's on the line.

198
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,157
Jack.

199
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:33,313
We found McCarthy's body
less than three blocks from the interchange.

200
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:37,598
We intercepted a call from LAPD.
The witness said the shooter was a female.

201
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:40,592
Left with a male fitting
Morris's description in a pickup.

202
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,717
- Did the witness get a license plate?
- No.

203
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:47,031
But McCarthy received a call
just about five minutes ago.

204
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,635
The caller ID is blocked.
I need to trace the source of the call.

205
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,597
- You think it came from Fayed?
- Yeah.

206
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:56,514
- I'll give it to Milo when you upload the data.
- It's on its way.

207
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,951
OK, knock.

208
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,953
<i>(Taj) What do you want?</i>

209
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,793
I'm Darren McCarthy's associate.
I have your package.

210
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,556
Who are you? Where's McCarthy?

211
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,756
He's waiting to hear from me.

212
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,354
If he doesn't get the money,
he gives you up.

213
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,032
- This is the engineer?
- Uh-huh.

214
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:49,910
I don't know what you're talking about. I'm
just a data analyst. You have the wrong man.

215
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,269
Look.

216
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:04,072
I brought you what you want.
Just give me the money and I'll go.

217
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:09,875
You'll get your money
when this man completes his task.

218
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:17,993
You work at CTU? So you know I have four
nuclear suitcase bombs in my possession.

219
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,390
These bombs need to be reprogrammed
before I can use them.

220
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:25,632
You are here to create a device
that will allow me to do so.

221
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,437
Not bloody likely, mate.

222
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:49,679
You're going to modify this
so that I can use it to reprogram the bombs.

223
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,833
No, I'm not.

224
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,558
<i>(yells)</i>

225
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:29,109
- What's happening with the phone trace?
- Milo's working on it.

226
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,909
- Why is it taking so long?
- Checking into it now.

227
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:39,631
- Milo, what's your status?
- The call was from a land line.

228
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:44,999
The number was routed through a dozen
servers and they keep cycling back on it.

229
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,719
- Come on.
- Are you gonna be able to do this?

230
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,951
Milo... let me try.

231
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:59,238
I know I screwed up earlier. I wasn't thinking
clearly. But let me try this. I can do it.

232
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,836
The number strains
are caught in the loop matrix.

233
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,717
Did you run a Satcom overlay filter?

234
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:09,554
It only works on cell-to-cell communications.
This was from a hard line.

235
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:14,714
NSA recently started using satellite carrier
systems as a backup for all phone traffic.

236
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:19,351
I just have to reconfigure the
embedded decryption program to... Got it.

237
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,757
That's it.

238
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:26,789
The call was from an apartment building -
4332 Florence Avenue.

239
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,314
- Copy, Jack?
- Yeah. Do we know which apartment?

240
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,472
No way to tell.
They tapped into the building's trunk line.

241
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:36,872
We're ready. Have Tactical meet us. Tell 'em
to set up a perimeter. Stay out of sight.

242
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,597
Understood.

243
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:49,110
- Good work, Milo.
- Sir, it wasn't me.

244
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:58,273
If you think she's ready,
bring her back in.

245
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,034
Mr Al-Assad, right this way.

246
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:28,956
We've checked out your background
and despite my understandable scepticism,

247
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,554
I do believe you want negotiated peace.

248
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:35,189
On my own terms, yes.

249
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:40,400
Let's table your terms
for the time being while we discuss mine.

250
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,836
My country, sir,
has suffered a nuclear attack

251
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:46,878
by the same terrorists
who used to follow you.

252
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,316
Thousands of innocent Americans
are dead or dying as we speak.

253
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,916
I am aware of the tragedy in California,
Mr President. I was there.

254
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:00,597
Then you understand that if Fayed detonates
any more nuclear weapons on US soil,

255
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:03,911
there will be no chance whatsoever
for a peace agreement.

256
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:09,196
The American people
are demanding that we strike back.

257
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,757
And notjust at organisations such as yours,
but at the governments that support them.

258
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,435
lfjust one more nuke goes off -
one more - we won't have a choice.

259
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:23,798
You understand me?
We're talking about war.

260
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,314
You don't have to tell me what is at stake.

261
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,710
But I still don't understand
what you want from me.

262
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:34,388
I'd like you to appear on television
and make a public address to the world.

263
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:39,156
Declare your intentions for peace and
appeal to members of Islamic communities

264
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:42,277
to come forward
with any information regarding Fayed.

265
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:45,193
You flatter me if you think
I hold sway over all Islam.

266
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:49,637
No, sir, not all. Just the extremists
who share your hatred of the west.

267
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,837
I certainly can't reach out
to them for help. I know you can.

268
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:56,071
But perception is everything, Mr President.

269
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:59,277
So I must present my agenda
to own my people in my own time,

270
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,636
not by appearing on American TV
from the White House!

271
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,756
Fayed already called me a traitor.

272
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:08,879
Many others will follow him if there is
a suspicion I am an American puppet!

273
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,953
Not a puppet, a partner. At least when
it comes to finding these nuclear weapons.

274
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:16,794
That is what we have to be for your
peace initiative to have a chance to work,

275
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,632
so get used to it.

276
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:25,036
Between you and me, I don't give a damn how
and when you wanted to present your agenda.

277
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,076
The time is now.

278
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:33,230
You wanna lead this peace initiative,
then lead.

279
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,830
- Who's in command?
- Agent Turner.

280
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:43,593
- What's the status of your perimeter?
- It's in place.

281
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,035
Plain-clothes agents are covering the exits.

282
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,998
Three TAC teams are ready
to move in on your command.

283
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,513
Is Fayed in the building?

284
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:55,879
Morris O'Brian entered the building
with a woman less than 20 minutes ago.

285
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:59,077
We assume the woman is the one
your witness saw shoot McCarthy.

286
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,549
We don't know what apartment
or floor they're on.

287
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:05,679
- CTU is patched in and awaiting your word.
- Thank you.

288
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,439
- Bill, it's Jack. Do you copy?
- Yes, go ahead.

289
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,830
I'm in the staging area.
We have confirmation Morris is inside.

290
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:25,436
We have no confirmation on Fayed. There are
no cameras. Do you have infrared satellite?

291
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:30,036
We can't get a live feed. We have a satellite
uploading images at five-minute intervals.

292
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:35,274
Latest scan shows 215 people spread out
over six floors and 112 apartments.

293
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:39,194
It'll take too long to go room by room.
We'll have to find another way to ID them.

294
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,515
Is it on the city's emergency services grid?

295
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:48,513
Yes, Jack. All buildings
over ten units are required to.

296
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:52,957
It's good to have you back.
Get into their system and trigger a fire alarm.

297
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:56,715
- We have to get past their login screens.
- Tell me when you're ready.

298
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,791
Agent.

299
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:07,433
<i>(Morris yells, gasps)</i>

300
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,556
Please stop. Please, just stop.

301
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,993
Indicate you will do
what I've asked and it will stop.

302
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,071
<i>(alarm)</i>

303
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:43,231
People are leaving the building.
If there really is a fire, what do we do?

304
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:51,555
There's no fire.
CTU knows we're here.

305
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:54,712
- I really need to get out of here.
- Shut up!

306
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,871
Up against the wall.

307
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,268
Your time is up!

308
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,871
I will use this all over your body
until you die of shock or blood loss.

309
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:46,557
Then I will just find someone else
to do what I need. Do you understand?

310
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:54,830
Look, please, I don't care about the money.

311
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:57,070
I made a mistake.

312
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:00,948
Just let me get out of here, please.

313
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:05,799
- So, you'd give up the seven million, huh?
- Yes.

314
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,595
OK.

315
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,831
Stop! Stop!

316
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,352
I'll do it.

317
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,676
<i>- (knock on door)
- Come in.</i>

318
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:09,634
This memo says Palmer's arranging for Assad
to make a televised statement?

319
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,948
I heard.

320
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:15,477
Not only are we providing free air time
to a mass murderer and enemy of democracy,

321
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:19,109
we are proving terrorism works.

322
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:26,791
- Do you have my letter of resignation?
- No, sir, I don't.

323
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:28,909
Why not?

324
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,676
You can't resign while this country is being
brought to the brink of a nuclear holocaust

325
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,228
by a weak, misguided president.

326
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:42,236
Dammit, Reed, I explained. I cannot
get the president to budge on policy.

327
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,630
There's nothing I can do about this.

328
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,678
What if I told you
that the climate could change.

329
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,155
What does that even mean, the climate?

330
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:57,392
I'm just saying that there are people
who believe, like you,

331
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:03,157
more aggressive steps need to be taken to
crack down on terrorism at home and abroad.

332
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:08,997
And that a change in leadership is imperative
to ensure this nation's security.

333
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,191
Um...

334
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:19,075
- Who?
- Excuse me, sir?

335
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:22,436
Who are these like-minded people
we're talking about?

336
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:25,557
Well, I'm just speaking abstractly.

337
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:29,792
But you'd have to agree that your plan
would have all the support it needed

338
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:33,509
if the vice president
were the man occupying the Oval Office.

339
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,832
Wait. Now, I may dislike
the president's current course of action.

340
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:41,276
I hardly think it warrants his removal.

341
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,874
I'm not talking about holding hearings.

342
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:48,759
Something more immediate
would have to happen.

343
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,796
Oh, my God.

344
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:02,118
You can't be intimating what I think you are.

345
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,350
I'm not intimating anything.

346
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,031
I'm just simply musing.

347
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:15,674
Careful. That kind of musing
can get you thrown into prison for treason.

348
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:21,196
Well, I'm sorry, sir,
that you've misunderstood me.

349
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:24,317
Yeah, I certainly hope so, for your sake.

350
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:28,717
All right, I think you have
a letter to draft for me.

351
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:44,469
You need to keep a safe distance
away from the building.

352
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:49,793
Move across the street for your own safety.
Move away from the building.

353
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,950
Anything from your men on the ground?

354
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:56,033
They've looked at everyone who's exited.
There's no sign of Fayed or O'Brian.

355
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:59,396
If they were inside when
the alarm went off, they still are.

356
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,357
Dammit.

357
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,670
<i>- Jack, it's Bill.
- Go ahead.</i>

358
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,274
We're mirroring the latest infrared
to your screen.

359
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:09,272
Hold on. I've got it.
I'm looking at it now.

360
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:12,636
Three people are left
on the second, fourth and sixth floors.

361
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,995
Chloe, who's renting those apartments?

362
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:20,029
Cross-referencing building schematics
with phone company and police records now.

363
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:29,232
A woman on the second floor is handicapped.
She probably didn't leave cos she can't.

364
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:31,470
The other two are occupied by single males.

365
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:34,996
The man on the fourth has been arrested
for distribution of narcotics.

366
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:38,470
Fayed wouldn't use anyone
with a record to set up a safe house.

367
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:41,757
They're on the sixth floor.
Get your men ready. Moving in.

368
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:42,829
Let's go!

369
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:51,994
- How much longer?
- I don't know.

370
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:55,709
This is a few minutes' work
for an advanced programmer. You're stalling.

371
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:58,758
I am not. It'll be ready in a minute.

372
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,036
Everybody seems to have evacuated.

373
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:06,955
Which is how they intend to find us.
At this point, it's only a question of time.

374
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,756
Go.

375
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,988
<i>(beeping)</i>

376
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,514
- It's done?
- Yes.

377
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:39,231
Bring it.

378
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,791
- You have the bombs here?
- Just one.

379
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:52,348
Let's see if you did your work correctly.

380
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,597
Arm it.

381
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,829
Arm it!

382
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,390
Very good.

383
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,228
Kill him.

384
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,788
Please, I did what you asked, didn't I?

385
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,473
Get up!

386
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,879
<i>(man) Put down your weapons!</i>

387
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,199
<i>(man #2) Stay covered. Stay covered.</i>

388
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,991
Now.

389
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,593
All agents sound off!

390
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,910
<i>- (man #1) Clear!
- (man #2) Clear!</i>

391
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:20,593
We took a head count of the bodies. One
hostile is missing. We haven't found Fayed.

392
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,675
It's clear, sir.

393
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:38,155
Have your men maintain the search for Fayed
and ID every exit.

394
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,231
- Yes, sir.
- What's his status?

395
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,833
He's unconscious but alive.

396
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:45,913
Chloe, it's Jack.
Morris has been injured but he's alive.

397
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,468
Mr Bauer, you need to see this.

398
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:27,232
CTU, this is Bauer.
We got a problem.

399
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:44,079
Be careful. The bomb has a fail-safe device
preventing forced entry.

400
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:48,199
I have two small metal plates
slowly converging on each other.

401
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:53,832
Those are triggers. If they touch, an electric
charge will detonate. The nuke will explode.

402
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,753
<i>- How far apart are they?
- About three inches.</i>

403
00:36:56,840 --> 00:37:01,755
OK, that gives us only about three minutes.
There's a small metal box to the right of it.

404
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:05,196
- Carefully unscrew the top of it.
- Copy that.

405
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:15,116
<i>(Turner) We know how Fayed got out.</i>

406
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,749
They opened a wall in a closet
to get to the ventilation system.

407
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:22,037
Fayed could get to the basement
and the sewer tunnels.

408
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:26,079
<i>- Did you set up a perimeter?
- Yes, but we believe Fayed's already gone.</i>

409
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:29,391
Witnesses saw a helicopter take off
a few minutes ago.

410
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:32,711
It looked like a medical evac chopper
so it got through our net.

411
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,994
Dammit.

412
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:44,949
The top's off.

413
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,996
We are running out of time.

414
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:53,518
Under the gears are four wires. Short-circuit
any two. It'll stop the left gear from rotating.

415
00:37:54,760 --> 00:38:01,154
Access the dipswitches underneath to open
the case and manually stop the trigger.

416
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:07,629
The left gear stopped.
The dipswitches are in the "up" position.

417
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:11,599
<i>- What's next?
- Um... Switch three and four to "down".</i>

418
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,438
The case didn't open.

419
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,272
- It didn't?
- That's what I said!

420
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:33,672
- Hold on.
- Chloe, we are almost out of time.

421
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:37,753
OK, I have an updated schematic.
It wasn't switches three and four.

422
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:41,150
Push four and five to "down"
and the cover will open.

423
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,309
Are you sure?

424
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:46,188
I'm about as sure as I'm going to be
before this bomb goes off.

425
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,989
<i>(Jack) It's done.
The bomb is disarmed.</i>

426
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,753
Tell your men the bomb's deactivated.
It's over.

427
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,957
- It's not over.
- What are you talking about?

428
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,918
The reprogramming device
Fayed had me build for him -

429
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,515
if it's not here,
it means he took it with him.

430
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:46,355
And with it, he can activate the
other bombs he has any time he wants.

431
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:49,955
- You gave him something that worked?!
- I'm sorry, Jack.

432
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:54,713
<i>- CTU, did you copy that?
- We got it. Alert the president immediately.</i>

433
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:58,315
Organise two teams to search
the apartment and around the building.

434
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,631
- O'Brian will tell you what you're looking for.
- Yes, sir.

435
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:33,120
<i>- (beeps)
- Yes, sir?</i>

436
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:36,670
<i>- You see this flash report in from CTU?
- I'm reading it now.</i>

437
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:40,036
They let Fayed
slip through their fingers... again.

438
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:45,433
Apparently he now has the capability
to arm his remaining suitcase nukes.

439
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:48,159
This situation is immeasurably worse.

440
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:51,391
You know my letter of resignation?
Have you got that?

441
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:55,712
Yes, I just finished printing it.
I can bring it over to you right now.

442
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:58,360
No, no, no.
No, just tear that up.

443
00:40:59,000 --> 00:40:59,955
What?

444
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,718
Um...

445
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:06,952
That talk we were having in my office -
I don't think I misunderstood you.

446
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:14,270
And I would like to discuss this... further.

447
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:19,199
Not on this phone. I'll let you know
when I have a secure location.
