1
00:00:15,374 --> 00:00:16,490
This is Bauer.

2
00:00:16,575 --> 00:00:20,454
Air Traffic Control received
a VCI distress signal from your aircraft.

3
00:00:20,536 --> 00:00:23,529
That authorises Logan to shoot you down.

4
00:00:23,616 --> 00:00:25,847
Start taking us down.

5
00:00:25,937 --> 00:00:27,848
Do it now.

6
00:00:27,938 --> 00:00:30,771
<i> Jack, the F-18 is within 15 miles. </i>

7
00:00:31,498 --> 00:00:33,490
My radar is locked on the target.

8
00:00:33,579 --> 00:00:35,490
- Lower the landing gear.
- We're going too fast!

9
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:36,614
Touch it down.

10
00:00:45,942 --> 00:00:49,060
- They're ready to move Bierko.
- Thank you. I'll be right out.

11
00:00:49,142 --> 00:00:54,172
Vladimir Bierko, you are being transferred to
a primary holding facility at our headquarters.

12
00:00:54,584 --> 00:00:57,657
The attorney general's
on his way to his office now.

13
00:00:57,745 --> 00:01:00,896
He'll be ready in ten minutes.

14
00:01:00,986 --> 00:01:03,819
Chloe, I want you
to prepare the recording for playback.

15
00:01:03,907 --> 00:01:08,503
Apply a digital signature so we can establish
a chain of evidence. Work alone.

16
00:01:08,867 --> 00:01:13,659
We got the evidence. President Logan's
gonna pay for David Palmer's assassination.

17
00:01:14,108 --> 00:01:18,421
The spectacle of a sitting president
on trial for murder would be devastating.

18
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:20,068
Yes, it would.

19
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:25,101
<i> If only we could keep such a trial
from taking place. </i>

20
00:01:25,191 --> 00:01:27,069
<i> Mr. President?</i>

21
00:01:27,152 --> 00:01:29,541
Miles Papazian. I work under Karen Hayes.

22
00:01:29,632 --> 00:01:32,909
<i>- What is this about?
- It's about a recording, sir. </i>

23
00:01:32,994 --> 00:01:37,272
If leaked, it could significantly compromise
national security.

24
00:01:37,354 --> 00:01:40,711
<i>- Why are you telling me this?
- I feel compelled to intervene. </i>

25
00:01:40,795 --> 00:01:44,391
And I just wanted to make sure
that you would approve.

26
00:01:44,476 --> 00:01:47,673
I do, Mr. Papazian. I do approve.

27
00:01:47,757 --> 00:01:49,076
Get out of here, Miles.

28
00:01:49,157 --> 00:01:54,187
- I'm just doing my job, Chloe.
- If your job is to slow things down.

29
00:01:54,718 --> 00:01:57,028
I'll tell Karen you'll be ready.

30
00:02:03,321 --> 00:02:08,919
- The attorney general will be ready in five.
- Did you tell him this implicates Logan?

31
00:02:09,002 --> 00:02:11,721
No. I feel he needs to hear it
directly from the source.

32
00:02:11,803 --> 00:02:13,600
Fine.

33
00:02:22,766 --> 00:02:25,280
- What's your status?
- Everything is set up.

34
00:02:25,366 --> 00:02:27,436
I've got a T1 line to the attorney general.

35
00:02:27,526 --> 00:02:30,439
- The other two lines are secured.
- What other two lines?

36
00:02:30,527 --> 00:02:34,077
Someone from the House judiciary committee
and a Congressional liaison.

37
00:02:34,168 --> 00:02:37,878
We need their support to call for Congress
to begin impeachment proceedings.

38
00:02:37,969 --> 00:02:39,961
What about an arrest warrant?

39
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:42,645
We'll never get justice
to indict a sitting president.

40
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:46,440
Removing him from office is
a necessary step to begin a full prosecution.

41
00:02:46,532 --> 00:02:50,890
All right, Chloe. Let's check the sound levels.
Play the recording.

42
00:02:57,654 --> 00:02:59,087
- What's wrong?
- I don't know!

43
00:02:59,174 --> 00:03:02,645
- Where's the recording?
- This is what's on the digital media.

44
00:03:02,735 --> 00:03:06,854
That's impossible. See if there's an overlay.
Check your connections.

45
00:03:09,697 --> 00:03:14,214
- There are no mistakes.
- Dammit, Chloe. What the hell happened?

46
00:03:14,298 --> 00:03:17,894
I don't know. If there was something
on this chip, it's been erased.

47
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:23,932
<i>- Yes?
- The attorney general is on the line. </i>

48
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:28,339
<i>- Ms Hayes?
- Bill will take the call in a moment.</i>

49
00:03:28,421 --> 00:03:31,698
I'll tell him we're having technical difficulties.

50
00:03:31,782 --> 00:03:35,219
- Someone got to that recording.
- Perhaps it was damaged.

51
00:03:35,303 --> 00:03:36,497
It wasn't.

52
00:03:36,823 --> 00:03:38,621
- Who had access to this room?
- No one.

53
00:03:38,704 --> 00:03:42,778
Someone did.
Who had access? Think about it!

54
00:03:43,945 --> 00:03:46,141
- Miles was in here.
- What?

55
00:03:46,586 --> 00:03:48,737
You sent him in here to check up on me.

56
00:03:48,827 --> 00:03:51,057
I never sent him in here.

57
00:03:52,067 --> 00:03:53,137
Jack.

58
00:04:00,029 --> 00:04:03,625
- Security, stop him.
Mr. Bauer.

59
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:07,588
Jack. Jack, stop.

60
00:04:10,271 --> 00:04:12,787
- You son of a bitch.
- Let go of me, Bauer.

61
00:04:12,872 --> 00:04:15,865
Do you know how many people died
so I could bring that in?

62
00:04:15,953 --> 00:04:19,867
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- We know it was you.

63
00:04:19,954 --> 00:04:23,072
Let him go, Jack. Jack, let him go.

64
00:04:27,115 --> 00:04:29,710
Where are you going, Miles?

65
00:04:29,796 --> 00:04:33,392
I've been transferred.
I was told to report immediately.

66
00:04:33,477 --> 00:04:36,914
- The order should come through any minute.
- Transferred to where?

67
00:04:39,598 --> 00:04:42,558
The White House.

68
00:04:52,282 --> 00:04:54,842
How could you do this, Miles?

69
00:04:56,443 --> 00:04:59,914
This is not over.
There will be an investigation.

70
00:05:00,004 --> 00:05:02,439
Do what you have to do, Karen.

71
00:05:02,524 --> 00:05:04,880
But I work for the president now.

72
00:05:19,649 --> 00:05:24,360
Jack, I am so sorry. I don't know how
he did it. He didn't even touch the recorder.

73
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:28,045
Karen, Audrey heard the recording
when I played it for Heller.

74
00:05:28,131 --> 00:05:31,363
- I know that she will sign an affidavit...
- Jack, not now.

75
00:05:31,452 --> 00:05:36,082
Chloe, take the recorder down to Processing.
See if you can restore anything.

76
00:05:36,172 --> 00:05:37,606
Fine.

77
00:05:37,693 --> 00:05:42,051
Ms Hayes. The president is calling for you.
Line two.

78
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:46,327
<i>- Mr. President.
- Karen. </i>

79
00:05:46,415 --> 00:05:51,490
What's this I hear about a conference call
you've scheduled with the attorney general?

80
00:05:51,576 --> 00:05:55,934
It's nothing, sir. A mistake.
The conference call was cancelled.

81
00:05:56,017 --> 00:06:01,046
Good. I'm glad to hear that. Listen,
the real reason for my call is Jack Bauer.

82
00:06:01,138 --> 00:06:04,814
- What about Jack Bauer?
- After further review,

83
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:08,530
it appears that the evidence against him is,
at best, inconclusive.

84
00:06:08,621 --> 00:06:12,535
I will have our lawyers continue to work on it,
but for the time being,

85
00:06:12,621 --> 00:06:14,977
I'm suspending the arrest order.

86
00:06:15,062 --> 00:06:19,056
<i>- You're dropping the charges against Bauer?
- That's correct. </i>

87
00:06:19,143 --> 00:06:22,738
Mr. President, you have had this office,
other agencies and the military

88
00:06:22,824 --> 00:06:26,134
dedicate all manpower and resources
into apprehending Bauer.

89
00:06:26,224 --> 00:06:29,582
Yes, based on evidence
I initially thought was credible.

90
00:06:29,665 --> 00:06:34,343
Now I have new information that's convinced
me that the original intel was faulty.

91
00:06:34,426 --> 00:06:39,342
- Am I to release Bauer, sir?
- I'll leave that to your discretion.

92
00:06:39,428 --> 00:06:43,422
Thank you, Karen. Good work.
We'll be in touch.

93
00:06:43,509 --> 00:06:45,545
<i>Yes, Mr. President. </i>

94
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:53,464
- He's letting me go as he knows he's won.
- What does he gain by releasing you?

95
00:06:53,551 --> 00:06:57,670
I'll be on my own.
Alone, unprotected - a perfect target.

96
00:06:57,993 --> 00:07:00,632
- Word just came in. Bierko's escaped.
- What?

97
00:07:00,713 --> 00:07:04,548
- How long ago?
- The convoy was hit ten minutes ago.

98
00:07:04,634 --> 00:07:08,992
They took out all our agents except one,
Davis, on line three.

99
00:07:09,075 --> 00:07:13,115
- Davis, Karen Hayes. What happened?
- Our lead car got taken out by an IED.

100
00:07:13,196 --> 00:07:17,588
I counted six attackers. Bierko got away
before I could call in backup.

101
00:07:17,677 --> 00:07:22,388
- Did you see the vehicle?
- Negative. I blacked out when I got hit.

102
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:27,508
- There's a medevac team on the way.
- I overheard Bierko talking to his men.

103
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,560
- He said they're not finished.
- Not finished?

104
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:35,635
Yes, ma'am. I'm certain he said something
about a nerve gas canister.

105
00:07:35,722 --> 00:07:39,112
- Did he say anything else?
- I'm sorry. That's all I heard.

106
00:07:39,202 --> 00:07:42,991
All right, Davis, stand by.
The medical team will be there in a minute.

107
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:45,439
Why would Bierko mention the Sentox?

108
00:07:45,524 --> 00:07:48,881
I assumed all the canisters
were destroyed in the explosions.

109
00:07:48,965 --> 00:07:50,922
How many canisters are accounted for?

110
00:07:51,005 --> 00:07:54,237
After the fires, there was not enough left
to do a full accounting.

111
00:07:54,326 --> 00:07:57,763
- Dammit.
- Bill, raise an interagency alert.

112
00:07:57,847 --> 00:08:00,885
I need LAPD to do a sweep
of the ambush area for witnesses.

113
00:08:00,968 --> 00:08:05,724
I want search helicopters. I want Chloe to
have full domain over surveillance satellites.

114
00:08:05,809 --> 00:08:09,962
This is priority one.
We have got to find Vladimir Bierko.

115
00:08:13,731 --> 00:08:16,963
We held one in reserve, just as you ordered.

116
00:08:17,051 --> 00:08:19,850
But I still don't understand why.

117
00:08:24,574 --> 00:08:28,408
We can't do much damage
with one canister of nerve gas.

118
00:08:28,494 --> 00:08:30,564
You're so wrong.

119
00:08:30,655 --> 00:08:32,850
Let's go.

120
00:09:33,711 --> 00:09:36,430
E- e-excuse me, Agent...

121
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:39,743
- It's Agent Cole, ma'am.
- Cole, I'm sorry, Agent Cole.

122
00:09:39,832 --> 00:09:45,829
My husband said Pierce had been transferred
to Washington, and this is his phone.

123
00:09:45,993 --> 00:09:49,191
I was wondering if you'd make sure
that it's returned to him.

124
00:09:49,274 --> 00:09:51,708
Of course.

125
00:09:56,236 --> 00:09:58,704
Was there anything else, ma'am?

126
00:09:58,797 --> 00:10:00,389
No.

127
00:10:00,477 --> 00:10:02,991
There's nothing else.

128
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,637
Oh, my God.

129
00:10:26,403 --> 00:10:28,997
I'm sorry about this, Aaron.

130
00:10:36,566 --> 00:10:39,400
Listen to me, Aaron.

131
00:10:39,486 --> 00:10:42,445
You think you know what's going on?

132
00:10:45,048 --> 00:10:51,603
- I'm here to tell you that you don't.
- Why don't you explain it, Mr. President?

133
00:10:51,689 --> 00:10:55,603
I understand Jack Bauer led you to believe
that there was a recording -

134
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:59,923
something that tied me
to David Palmer's murder.

135
00:11:01,532 --> 00:11:05,526
- That recording doesn't exist.
- That's not what I've been told.

136
00:11:05,613 --> 00:11:09,004
You're not hearing what I'm saying.

137
00:11:09,093 --> 00:11:13,532
The recording doesn't exist.

138
00:11:13,615 --> 00:11:16,527
It's over.

139
00:11:16,616 --> 00:11:19,176
You have a choice here, Aaron.

140
00:11:19,256 --> 00:11:21,487
You are a good man.

141
00:11:21,576 --> 00:11:26,368
You're a fine agent.
I see no reason to throw away your career.

142
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:30,737
But I need to know
that we can put this behind us.

143
00:11:33,379 --> 00:11:35,530
Give me your word you will let this drop,

144
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:41,412
and I will make sure that you are reassigned
to whatever post you want...

145
00:11:41,501 --> 00:11:44,300
except for the White House, of course.

146
00:11:44,382 --> 00:11:46,101
So...

147
00:11:47,102 --> 00:11:49,981
what's it gonna be, Aaron?

148
00:11:50,064 --> 00:11:52,704
Are my terms acceptable?

149
00:11:52,784 --> 00:11:59,578
There is nothing that you have said or done
that is acceptable to me in the least.

150
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:04,536
You're a traitor to this country,
and a disgrace to your office.

151
00:12:04,627 --> 00:12:10,021
And it's my duty to see that you're
brought to justice for what you've done.

152
00:12:10,109 --> 00:12:13,102
Is there anything else... Charles?

153
00:12:50,999 --> 00:12:54,514
I know Pierce, Mr. President.
I've served with him for five years.

154
00:12:54,599 --> 00:13:00,597
His loyalty is to David Palmer. Believe me
when I tell you he's going to be a problem.

155
00:13:33,969 --> 00:13:37,598
Mr. President. I confess
I didn't expect to hear from you again.

156
00:13:37,689 --> 00:13:40,727
The situation's changed.
Everything's under control.

157
00:13:40,811 --> 00:13:44,406
The recording's been destroyed.
It's no longer a problem.

158
00:13:44,492 --> 00:13:48,087
That's very good news, but what about
the people who have heard it?

159
00:13:48,172 --> 00:13:52,804
They can't do anything without proof. I don't
think any further action needs to be taken.

160
00:13:52,894 --> 00:13:55,613
And you've got
the rest of your house in order?

161
00:13:55,694 --> 00:14:00,564
If by that you mean my wife, yes.
Yes, she's cooperating fully.

162
00:14:00,655 --> 00:14:05,411
As for Aaron Pierce, that's another matter,
but, um, I'm taking care of that.

163
00:14:05,497 --> 00:14:08,853
Of course. What about Jack Bauer?

164
00:14:08,938 --> 00:14:11,896
I've given Karen Hayes permission
to release him.

165
00:14:11,978 --> 00:14:17,179
The arrangements that we discussed
about taking him out have been set in motion.

166
00:14:17,259 --> 00:14:20,218
You have everything well in hand,
Mr. President.

167
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:23,099
Yes, yes. I said I would handle it, and I have.

168
00:14:23,181 --> 00:14:28,336
The situation's contained.
There's nothing more to worry about.

169
00:14:29,062 --> 00:14:31,452
I'll call you back.

170
00:14:33,463 --> 00:14:35,419
Mike?

171
00:14:35,504 --> 00:14:38,064
- Sir.
- What is it, Mike?

172
00:14:38,145 --> 00:14:40,659
I just got off the phone with Karen Hayes.

173
00:14:40,745 --> 00:14:44,534
- Vladimir Bierko has escaped.
- What? How?

174
00:14:44,626 --> 00:14:48,142
The caravan transporting him to District
was ambushed.

175
00:14:48,227 --> 00:14:52,744
Dammit! We rolled CTU into Homeland
Security to avoid screwups like this.

176
00:14:52,828 --> 00:14:57,823
There's more, sir. They have reason to believe
Bierko might be readying another attack.

177
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:01,949
- What kind of attack?
- CTU's working on that now.

178
00:15:03,631 --> 00:15:07,146
I want constant updates.
You keep me apprised of their progress.

179
00:15:07,232 --> 00:15:09,383
Yes, sir.

180
00:15:16,674 --> 00:15:19,188
- Chloe, any luck?
- Only the bad kind.

181
00:15:19,275 --> 00:15:23,633
None of these satellites were positioned
toward the ambush site. I tried to redirect.

182
00:15:23,716 --> 00:15:26,753
- Did you try Caltrans?
- I'm backstreaming. So far, it's dry.

183
00:15:26,836 --> 00:15:29,829
- We've gotta get an ID on the vehicle.
- I know.

184
00:15:29,917 --> 00:15:33,194
That was LAPD Command.
They can't find any witnesses.

185
00:15:33,278 --> 00:15:36,236
- None?
- 4am in a curfew. No one was there.

186
00:15:36,319 --> 00:15:38,549
Then we have nothing.

187
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,278
- Henderson.
- What about him?

188
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,715
He set up Bierko with the nerve gas.

189
00:15:44,801 --> 00:15:47,361
He won't talk to us, and you know that.

190
00:15:47,442 --> 00:15:51,833
If Henderson's the patriot he says he is,
he won't want those terrorists to succeed.

191
00:15:51,922 --> 00:15:56,474
- Trust me, he's not gonna help us.
- He will if we offer him a deal.

192
00:15:56,563 --> 00:15:58,839
- And that's not gonna happen.
- Jack.

193
00:15:58,924 --> 00:16:01,314
No. Not this time. Not this man.

194
00:16:01,405 --> 00:16:05,558
We're running out of options. This is
about saving lives, not indulging a grudge.

195
00:16:05,646 --> 00:16:09,037
You think this is about a grudge?
He killed an ex-president.

196
00:16:09,127 --> 00:16:12,915
He tried to kill the secretary of defense.
You want him to have full immunity?

197
00:16:13,007 --> 00:16:17,525
It's about doing what has to be done.
Nobody knows that better than you.

198
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:23,287
Bierko's gonna kill innocent people.
Henderson's our only chance to stop him.

199
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:27,728
Jack. What would David Palmer
want you to do if he were here?

200
00:16:27,811 --> 00:16:32,840
The best way to honour his memory
is to make the choice to save others.

201
00:16:35,293 --> 00:16:41,734
I can't stop you from doing this. If you're
gonna give him a deal, let me present it.

202
00:16:43,215 --> 00:16:46,094
- All right.
- Thank you.

203
00:17:09,941 --> 00:17:14,778
Since you're clearly no longer a fugitive,
I assume they retrieved that recording.

204
00:17:14,862 --> 00:17:18,334
Someone got to it and erased it.
I'm not here about the recording.

205
00:17:18,423 --> 00:17:21,814
Bierko escaped half an hour ago.
He's gonna carry out another attack.

206
00:17:21,904 --> 00:17:25,785
I'm sure he will. You bruised his ego
when you stopped his first attempt.

207
00:17:25,865 --> 00:17:31,418
You know him. You know how he thinks.
You studied him before you set up this deal.

208
00:17:31,507 --> 00:17:34,419
- What's he gonna do?
- Why should I help you?

209
00:17:34,507 --> 00:17:37,705
You call yourself a patriot. Prove it.

210
00:17:37,788 --> 00:17:42,260
These terrorists are gonna attack the country
that you love because you betrayed them.

211
00:17:42,349 --> 00:17:46,821
Why don't you help me
put out the fire that you started?

212
00:17:52,512 --> 00:17:56,392
They sent you in here
to broker a deal, didn't they?

213
00:17:57,473 --> 00:18:00,352
What's the offer? Full immunity?

214
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:06,225
It just must be really eating you up inside.

215
00:18:06,315 --> 00:18:11,027
What do you think? You were responsible for
the murder of people that I cared about.

216
00:18:11,116 --> 00:18:15,908
I am sorry about David Palmer, I am, but
what I did was in the interest of this country,

217
00:18:15,998 --> 00:18:19,468
<i>and I'm not talking about the version
you read in the New York Times.</i>

218
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:24,315
I'm talking about the politics of survival.
The way the world really works.

219
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,312
You want immunity or not?

220
00:18:27,401 --> 00:18:30,711
- Immunity is worthless.
- Yeah?

221
00:18:34,563 --> 00:18:37,282
Jack.

222
00:18:37,363 --> 00:18:40,082
That recording was my only immunity.

223
00:18:40,164 --> 00:18:43,634
They give me a piece of paper,
I walk out of here, I'm a dead man.

224
00:18:43,725 --> 00:18:48,845
Two days, two hours, two months,
who cares? They're gonna take me down.

225
00:18:48,926 --> 00:18:50,040
Who's "they"?

226
00:18:50,126 --> 00:18:53,722
Same people who made Walt Cummings
look like a suicide.

227
00:18:53,807 --> 00:18:58,643
Come on, Jack. You can't really believe
that Logan masterminded this by himself?

228
00:18:58,728 --> 00:19:02,324
- Give me the names.
- You can't touch them.

229
00:19:02,409 --> 00:19:05,243
But they can touch you.

230
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:10,965
I'll help you catch Bierko,
but not for an immunity deal.

231
00:19:11,051 --> 00:19:13,885
I need something more,
and you can make it happen.

232
00:19:13,971 --> 00:19:19,684
- What do you want?
- To disappear. Just like you did.

233
00:19:19,773 --> 00:19:23,972
I won't make your mistake. I'm gonna
leave the country, and take Miriam with me.

234
00:19:24,054 --> 00:19:28,686
- You don't need my help for that.
- My contacts are still loyal to the president.

235
00:19:28,775 --> 00:19:31,768
I need somebody I can trust
to cover our tracks.

236
00:19:31,856 --> 00:19:36,055
I need somebody to do a better job of it than
the incompetents who failed to cover yours.

237
00:19:36,137 --> 00:19:40,131
What makes you think that I'm not gonna
kill you the second this is over?

238
00:19:40,218 --> 00:19:45,010
Because you're gonna give me your word.
And I know what your word is worth to you.

239
00:19:45,099 --> 00:19:47,978
So it's all I need.

240
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:55,414
Let's say that I agree to this.
Anything less than Bierko's head on a plate -

241
00:19:55,502 --> 00:19:57,494
this deal is off.

242
00:19:57,582 --> 00:19:59,573
Fine.

243
00:20:00,103 --> 00:20:05,815
Now, Bierko is gonna hit hard,
so you'd better think fast.

244
00:20:19,748 --> 00:20:25,745
Chloe, do a phone check on these 14 names.
I want you working out of the situation room.

245
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:31,499
- What do we have?
- Henderson gave us 14 names.

246
00:20:31,591 --> 00:20:34,981
- Chloe's pulling up relative data.
- Is Tactical standing by?

247
00:20:35,071 --> 00:20:38,144
On priority alert.
I put Manning in command, if that's OK.

248
00:20:38,232 --> 00:20:43,308
- I trust your judgment, Bill.
- Henderson's coming in here for a debrief.

249
00:20:44,714 --> 00:20:47,626
Excuse me for one second.

250
00:20:49,595 --> 00:20:52,110
Audrey.

251
00:20:52,195 --> 00:20:54,790
Jack, I just heard about the recording.

252
00:20:54,876 --> 00:20:57,596
- President Logan managed to get to it.
- My God.

253
00:20:57,677 --> 00:21:03,355
- We have a more immediate problem.
- Bierko. I heard. I was hoping I could help.

254
00:21:03,438 --> 00:21:06,158
Why is Henderson coming out of Holding?

255
00:21:06,239 --> 00:21:08,629
We're using him to help us find Bierko.

256
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:12,911
Audrey, Karen made a deal.
She gave him immunity.

257
00:21:13,001 --> 00:21:16,198
What? Jack, how can you let this happen?

258
00:21:16,282 --> 00:21:23,155
We didn't have a choice. Bierko's planning an
attack. Without Henderson, we won't find him.

259
00:21:23,243 --> 00:21:25,803
Jack, I think we've got something.

260
00:21:27,324 --> 00:21:30,715
Audrey, I'm sorry. I gotta go.

261
00:21:35,286 --> 00:21:39,200
What do we have?
- Only one of the 14 has an active cellphone.

262
00:21:39,287 --> 00:21:40,276
Joseph Malina.

263
00:21:40,367 --> 00:21:45,727
Malina's an arms dealer. A military contractor
until they accused him of selling secrets.

264
00:21:45,809 --> 00:21:48,927
- But they couldn't prove anything.
- You know him?

265
00:21:49,009 --> 00:21:52,400
I did business with him
before and after he was arrested.

266
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:56,450
What do you have on him?
- A 12-second call on his phone at 4:03am

267
00:21:56,531 --> 00:21:59,251
from a payphone in Van Nuys,
not far from the ambush site.

268
00:21:59,332 --> 00:22:02,848
A minute later the same payphone
got a callback from a GSM sat phone.

269
00:22:02,933 --> 00:22:05,926
He took the number down,
and called from an untraceable line.

270
00:22:06,013 --> 00:22:08,927
- Sounds like our guy.
- Tell Curtis to mobilise his team.

271
00:22:09,014 --> 00:22:12,052
Hang on, hang on.
What good is that gonna accomplish?

272
00:22:12,135 --> 00:22:15,208
You bring Malina in,
you think he'll roll over on Bierko?

273
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:18,493
He didn't cut a deal before,
he's not gonna cut a deal now.

274
00:22:18,577 --> 00:22:23,049
And even if you can crack him, you're
gonna need hours. You don't have hours.

275
00:22:23,137 --> 00:22:27,576
- What do you suggest?
- I suggest you send me in to talk to Malina.

276
00:22:27,659 --> 00:22:29,935
I'll find out what Bierko got from him.

277
00:22:30,019 --> 00:22:34,298
- I don't think so.
- You know you can't get anything out of him.

278
00:22:34,381 --> 00:22:37,054
His computer makes this place
look like an internet café.

279
00:22:37,141 --> 00:22:42,092
He's got the absolute most sophisticated
security system, including a Phoenix shield.

280
00:22:42,183 --> 00:22:45,255
- We get through it.
- Not a Phoenix. It's a poison-pill firewall.

281
00:22:45,344 --> 00:22:48,939
Any attempt at circumventing it
and the hard drive does a cold start erase.

282
00:22:49,024 --> 00:22:51,822
You can forget about retrieving any data.

283
00:22:51,905 --> 00:22:54,817
Take him back to Holding.

284
00:23:00,747 --> 00:23:04,457
- I don't think we have a choice here.
- Karen, please. Don't do this.

285
00:23:04,548 --> 00:23:07,905
Jack, I know how you feel,
but Henderson's right.

286
00:23:07,989 --> 00:23:11,699
- We can't afford to gamble on this play.
- You cannot trust this guy.

287
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:16,387
I agree. That's why I'm sending you with him.
I want him under your guard on a tight leash.

288
00:23:16,471 --> 00:23:20,988
If he tries anything,
I swear to you, I will kill him.

289
00:23:21,072 --> 00:23:23,985
Then don't let it get to that point.

290
00:24:32,409 --> 00:24:34,207
Get in.

291
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:37,920
Adams, listen to me.
You don't have to do this.

292
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:42,688
Logan isn't worth protecting. He's not gonna
get away with any of this. Neither will you.

293
00:24:42,772 --> 00:24:44,923
- Get in the trunk.
- Use your head.

294
00:24:45,012 --> 00:24:48,688
Logan wants me dead because
I know too much, I'm a liability.

295
00:24:48,773 --> 00:24:51,971
How soon before you're just another liability?

296
00:24:53,294 --> 00:24:55,490
Agh!

297
00:24:56,135 --> 00:24:57,773
Agh!

298
00:24:57,856 --> 00:25:00,245
What are you doing?

299
00:25:01,376 --> 00:25:04,050
Ma'am, please stay where you are.

300
00:25:04,137 --> 00:25:06,333
Aaron?

301
00:25:09,139 --> 00:25:11,050
You're going to shoot me?

302
00:25:18,181 --> 00:25:20,330
I'm the first lady.

303
00:25:22,142 --> 00:25:25,293
You're gonna shoot the first lady?

304
00:25:26,702 --> 00:25:30,059
- Who are you calling?
- Mrs. Logan, this is my last warning.

305
00:25:30,143 --> 00:25:31,542
Agh!

306
00:25:57,630 --> 00:26:00,429
Martha.

307
00:26:01,631 --> 00:26:04,704
Aaron. Oh, God.

308
00:26:04,792 --> 00:26:07,387
Aaron. Stay with me.

309
00:26:07,472 --> 00:26:11,785
Aaron, oh, God. Oh, God, Aaron.

310
00:26:32,751 --> 00:26:35,789
Jack. We're coming up on Malina's place.

311
00:26:54,956 --> 00:26:58,711
Curtis, set up a perimeter.
A man on each possible escape route.

312
00:26:58,797 --> 00:27:00,674
- You got it.
- You got ten minutes.

313
00:27:00,758 --> 00:27:03,875
You don't get the intel by then,
we come in and interrogate him.

314
00:27:03,959 --> 00:27:06,871
Interrogating won't work.
This guy won't break.

315
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:09,872
You better hope your way does.
Give me an audio pack.

316
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,997
- Undo your shirt.
- You can't wire me.

317
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,641
- Why not?
- Think about it. You read Malina's file.

318
00:27:14,721 --> 00:27:18,556
He didn't get here by being careless.
He's got a scanner, God knows what else.

319
00:27:18,642 --> 00:27:24,275
The second I walk through that door with
a wire, the bells go off, this thing's over.

320
00:27:25,724 --> 00:27:30,640
Look, you don't trust me - fine. And just
so we're straight, I don't trust you either.

321
00:27:30,725 --> 00:27:33,638
But neither one of us
can afford to blow this operation.

322
00:27:33,726 --> 00:27:36,446
We're all set. They're in position.

323
00:27:37,247 --> 00:27:43,244
No games, Christopher. I don't need
another reason to put a bullet in your brain.

324
00:27:43,688 --> 00:27:45,725
You got ten minutes.

325
00:27:45,808 --> 00:27:49,564
- Patch CTU in. Monitor channel eight.
- Got it.

326
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:55,404
Hold up.

327
00:27:57,771 --> 00:27:59,569
Go.

328
00:28:22,097 --> 00:28:24,532
Who is it?

329
00:28:25,618 --> 00:28:27,928
<i>- What do you want, Chris?
- We have to talk. </i>

330
00:28:28,019 --> 00:28:31,898
<i>- What, at 4:30 in the morning?
- About Vladimir Bierko. </i>

331
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:35,571
You don't waste my time,
I don't waste your time.

332
00:28:35,661 --> 00:28:38,130
You're gonna wanna hear what I have to say.

333
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,433
Hey! What's so important it couldn't wait?

334
00:30:03,762 --> 00:30:07,313
- What are you looking for?
- Is there another way outta here?

335
00:30:07,403 --> 00:30:08,756
What are you talking about?

336
00:30:08,844 --> 00:30:11,233
I don't like this. What's Henderson doing?

337
00:30:11,324 --> 00:30:14,475
I don't know yet. Maintain your position.

338
00:30:14,565 --> 00:30:17,956
- Secure files, anything you can't do without.
- Why?

339
00:30:18,046 --> 00:30:23,440
Because there is an entire phalanx of CTU
agents outside, including ex-agent Bauer.

340
00:30:23,527 --> 00:30:27,316
- He's selling us out, Jack.
Bauer is running me.

341
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:30,002
But I know he's gonna kill me
first chance he gets.

342
00:30:30,089 --> 00:30:32,967
- Curtis, move your teams in now.
- All teams, move in. Now!

343
00:30:33,049 --> 00:30:36,247
- Bastard, you brought him here!
- He was coming here anyway!

344
00:30:36,331 --> 00:30:41,610
Secure the files, crash the system.
Stop wasting time and do it.

345
00:31:36,665 --> 00:31:38,702
Give me your weapon.

346
00:31:54,429 --> 00:31:55,578
Freeze!

347
00:31:58,710 --> 00:31:59,939
Agh!

348
00:32:04,031 --> 00:32:09,266
- Cover Malina.
- Christopher! Let me see your hands, now!

349
00:32:10,273 --> 00:32:13,789
Slowly, stand up.

350
00:32:13,874 --> 00:32:16,673
Put the weapon on the counter.

351
00:32:17,755 --> 00:32:20,714
Step back.

352
00:32:22,636 --> 00:32:27,188
- Curtis! How are your men?
- My men are fine. I've been hit. I'm OK.

353
00:32:27,277 --> 00:32:30,270
Call in Medical. Get 'em to CTU.
What's Malina's condition?

354
00:32:30,358 --> 00:32:33,954
- Gunshot to the hip. He's losing blood.
- Stabilise him. Keep him alive.

355
00:32:34,039 --> 00:32:36,474
I had him. 30 more seconds was all I needed.

356
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:40,394
- You played me. This is over.
- No, you blew it, Jack.

357
00:32:40,481 --> 00:32:43,314
- What you talking about?
- I got him to lift the firewall.

358
00:32:43,401 --> 00:32:47,999
He was about to dump all of his files onto
a flash drive before you jumped the gun.

359
00:32:48,082 --> 00:32:51,871
You're gonna waste a hell of a lot of time
trying to decrypt those files.

360
00:32:51,963 --> 00:32:57,039
So you better pray
there's something on there you can read.

361
00:32:57,124 --> 00:32:59,320
Cuff him.

362
00:32:59,405 --> 00:33:04,480
Bill, get Chloe to open a channel. I'm gonna
send you some files from Malina's computer.

363
00:33:04,566 --> 00:33:09,163
- I'm on it, Jack.
- Find which files were last open.

364
00:33:09,247 --> 00:33:11,239
They'll tell us what Malina sold Bierko.

365
00:33:11,328 --> 00:33:16,278
<i>- They're coming through now. Hang on.
- Curtis was hit. He's coming back to CTU.</i>

366
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:19,726
- All right. I'll tell Medical.
- Send a chopper to this location.

367
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:22,324
As soon as we know the target,
we need to move fast.

368
00:33:22,411 --> 00:33:25,642
It's gonna take me some time
to decrypt the files.

369
00:33:25,732 --> 00:33:30,488
Do it as quickly as you can. Bierko's gonna
release the gas soon. We need to know where.

370
00:33:30,573 --> 00:33:34,361
There, you should have everything.
Let's go.

371
00:33:49,017 --> 00:33:51,327
Aaron.

372
00:33:51,418 --> 00:33:56,891
Charles lied to me. He said
you'd been transferred to Washington.

373
00:33:58,299 --> 00:34:01,292
That... agent, um...

374
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:07,777
Adams, my husband ordered him
to kill you, didn't he?

375
00:34:08,542 --> 00:34:10,100
Yes, ma'am.

376
00:34:12,863 --> 00:34:17,813
I'm sorry to tell you the president was
involved with much worse things than that.

377
00:34:17,905 --> 00:34:20,703
I know.

378
00:34:22,826 --> 00:34:26,535
I was gonna let him get away with it. All of it.

379
00:34:27,467 --> 00:34:29,662
I was gonna keep quiet.

380
00:34:33,268 --> 00:34:35,418
We have to do something.

381
00:34:35,508 --> 00:34:38,979
I'll hide the body. I'll get him in the trunk.

382
00:34:39,069 --> 00:34:44,622
But I can't drive it out of here.
The president has to believe that I'm dead.

383
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:47,465
I need to lay low. Keep out of sight.

384
00:34:47,551 --> 00:34:49,270
- I can do it.
- No.

385
00:34:49,351 --> 00:34:51,741
- Yes, Aaron. I can drive it.
- No.

386
00:34:51,832 --> 00:34:54,905
No, you need to get back inside the residence.

387
00:34:54,993 --> 00:34:59,226
Your husband can't suspect
that anything has gone wrong.

388
00:34:59,314 --> 00:35:01,909
You need to find Mike Novick.

389
00:35:01,995 --> 00:35:05,112
- Mike?
- Tell him everything.

390
00:35:06,156 --> 00:35:09,388
- And tell him to meet me here.
- OK.

391
00:35:10,877 --> 00:35:13,551
Aaron, promise me...

392
00:35:16,319 --> 00:35:18,628
promise me that...

393
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:22,508
if something goes wrong,
and you're in danger of getting caught,

394
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:27,914
you will find a way off these grounds,
and you will leave.

395
00:35:28,002 --> 00:35:30,151
Promise me.

396
00:35:30,241 --> 00:35:32,996
You have my word.

397
00:35:59,369 --> 00:36:02,646
- Secure him on the tailgate.
- Yes, sir.

398
00:36:08,011 --> 00:36:10,923
- Buchanan.
- Bill, how's Chloe doing with the files?

399
00:36:11,012 --> 00:36:13,606
- Almost there, Jack.
- OK, I got it.

400
00:36:14,292 --> 00:36:16,443
Wait, there's something more.

401
00:36:16,533 --> 00:36:20,607
Classified defence contracts and plans.

402
00:36:21,895 --> 00:36:23,613
It's a Russian submarine.

403
00:36:23,695 --> 00:36:28,895
<i>The Natalia K 524 Delta IV class.
It's scheduled for inspection by our navy.</i>

404
00:36:28,976 --> 00:36:31,445
Why is the US navy
inspecting a Russian submarine?

405
00:36:31,537 --> 00:36:37,295
It's part of the treaty that Logan and Suvarov
signed. It calls for the sharing of technology.

406
00:36:37,378 --> 00:36:42,214
- Where is it docked?
- Docking station eight. Port of Los Angeles.

407
00:36:42,299 --> 00:36:44,734
- I'll deport tac teams to the port.
- Good.

408
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:47,051
Chloe, hold on.

409
00:36:47,141 --> 00:36:50,134
What is the armament package
on a Russian Delta IV class sub?

410
00:36:50,221 --> 00:36:53,737
- 12 Scorpion land-attack missiles.
- Are they nuclear?

411
00:36:53,822 --> 00:36:59,740
No, but they carry multiple warheads.
One could take out several city blocks.

412
00:36:59,823 --> 00:37:01,542
Uncuff him.

413
00:37:01,624 --> 00:37:04,423
<i>- Karen, it's Jack. Are you still there?
- I'm here. </i>

414
00:37:04,504 --> 00:37:08,055
<i>I need you to put me in touch
with the ranking US officer on the Natalia.</i>

415
00:37:08,146 --> 00:37:11,138
We need them to lock out
their onboard weapons systems.

416
00:37:11,226 --> 00:37:15,937
I'll have Audrey call DOD and open a priority
line to the sub. She'll get back to you.

417
00:37:16,027 --> 00:37:20,944
- OK. Thank you. You're coming with me.
- I found Bierko's target for you.

418
00:37:21,029 --> 00:37:24,659
- The deal was Bierko's head on a plate.
- What do you want me to do? Kill him?

419
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:29,108
The only reason you're going with me is
because you know the weapons system.

420
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:31,147
Get in.

421
00:37:31,231 --> 00:37:32,745
Let's go!

422
00:37:45,715 --> 00:37:46,784
Bauer.

423
00:37:46,875 --> 00:37:50,312
<i>I've got the ranking officer
on the Natalia. I'm putting you through.</i>

424
00:37:50,396 --> 00:37:54,310
- OK, Audrey, stay on the line.
- All right, Jack. Hold on.

425
00:37:57,118 --> 00:38:00,076
<i>- You're on with Jack Bauer. 
- What is this about?</i>

426
00:38:00,159 --> 00:38:03,435
<i>We believe the Natalia
has been targeted for a terrorist attack.</i>

427
00:38:03,519 --> 00:38:07,069
Secure your vessel. Lock down
your weapon systems immediately.

428
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:11,393
Skeet, call all hands. Set condition Delta.
Seal the bridge and aft hatches.

429
00:38:11,481 --> 00:38:13,472
- Aye, sir.
- Put your men on alert.

430
00:38:13,562 --> 00:38:17,714
<i>- There's a threat to your submarine.
- Horosho. </i>

431
00:38:17,803 --> 00:38:22,001
- Now, what is the nature of this threat?
- The terrorists are after your missiles.

432
00:38:22,084 --> 00:38:24,473
I'm gonna check right now.

433
00:38:42,168 --> 00:38:46,048
- Sailor! I've got that. Report aft.
- Yes, sir.

434
00:38:50,491 --> 00:38:52,561
Bauer. I'm checking topside.

435
00:39:03,053 --> 00:39:04,487
Lieutenant!

436
00:39:04,574 --> 00:39:07,884
- Dammit, Audrey, I've lost him. Notify DOD.
- I'm on it.

437
00:39:07,975 --> 00:39:10,888
Captain, we need to move.

438
00:39:17,377 --> 00:39:19,333
It's ready.

439
00:39:37,302 --> 00:39:41,455
- Captain, how far out are we?
- Just over five minutes, sir.

440
00:40:17,032 --> 00:40:19,910
<i>- That way.
- Mhy syuda. </i>
