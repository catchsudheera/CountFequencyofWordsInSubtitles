4
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:12,240
Previously on 24 ...

5
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:15,050
We need to pick him off to try to save the president.

6
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:16,680
I'll make a run for the lockdown room.

7
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:18,850
There are five canisters of CH-4.

8
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,850
All we need is one stray bullet.

9
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,890
A suicide play, Jack.

10
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:24,220
We don't have a choice.

11
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:31,230
Don't you move!

12
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:33,800
We have the president!

13
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:35,070
The president is secure!

14
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:36,430
I'm so sorry, Jack.

15
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,040
I know that he was your friend.

16
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,440
It was supposed to be me.

17
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,540
Juma and his men were not working alone.

18
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:43,310
And right now, the only lead we've got is Ryan Burnett.

19
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:45,110
He knew about the attack on the white house,

20
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:48,110
And chances are, he's gonna know who Juma was talking to.

21
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,150
I'm thinking about bringing Olivia on ...

22
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:54,250
as a special advisor.

23
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,020
Nobody's forgotten what she did during the campaign.

24
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:57,920
Leaking damaging personal information

25
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:59,490
About your opponent to the press.

26
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,990
She's changed.

27
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:02,760
It's not the past that concerns me.

28
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:03,990
Do you think any of this

29
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:06,060
would've happened if my mother had a chief advisor

30
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:08,330
who knew what the hell was going on in her administration?

31
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,470
I just got off the phone with Ethan Kanin.

32
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:13,500
He's ordering me to let Bauer interrogate Burnett.

33
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:15,370
Look, I didn't want to go behind your back,

34
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,840
but you didn't leave me any choice.

35
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,340
I want you to clean out your office

36
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:19,740
and hand in your badge.

37
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:21,040
I'm suspending you.

38
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:24,280
Jack Bauer's on his way to Kennedy Memorial Hospital.

39
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:26,250
Burnett will tell him everything.

40
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,880
I have already sent somebody to the hospital

41
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:29,290
to deal with Burnett.

42
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:31,650
He can take care of Bauer at the same time.

43
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,290
You lay one finger on him, it's over.

44
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,960
Right.

45
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:37,790
Juma's attack failed.

46
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,500
He's dead, so are his men.

47
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,370
Somebody get me the hell out of here!

48
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:43,800
You're not going anywhere.

49
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:44,930
What happened?

50
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,940
What's going on?

51
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,080
Damn it, Bauer, open the door!

52
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,320
I want a high-priority APB issued for Jack Bauer.

53
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:03,550
Larry, it's Jack. Listen to me.

54
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:04,890
I'm being set up.

55
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,390
Don't let them get away with this.

56
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,130
This threat is not over.

57
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:14,730
The following takes place
between 9 P.M. and 10 P.M.

58
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,520
I dropped my wife off here five hours ago,

59
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,760
and now no one can tell me where she is.

60
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:17,390
Mr. O'Brian, the white house has been attacked.

61
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,030
We're in the midst of an urgent protocol.

62
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,650
Exactly. That's why I'd like to

63
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:22,100
know if my wife all right.

64
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:23,330
She is. She's fine.

65
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,370
Where is she?

66
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,570
Tell me.

67
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,570
She's in a holding room on the third floor.

68
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,270
What...? She's been arrested.

69
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,140
That's absurd.

70
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:34,140
What's she charged with? I want to see her.

71
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:35,850
Listen, I've already told you more than I should have.

72
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:38,120
When Agent Moss returns, he'll
tell you everything you need to know.

73
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:39,380
In the meanwhile, I'm gonna have

74
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:41,220
to ask you to wait in the conference room, okay?

75
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:42,350
Please. I'm sorry.

76
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:43,820
Please escort him to the conference room.

77
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:44,990
Thank you.

78
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:48,130
Janis, Larry's calling for you.

79
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:49,290
He says it's urgent.

80
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,490
- What line?
- Three.

81
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,130
Sign here, verifying you understand

82
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,930
the terms of your suspension,

83
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,330
and again here...

84
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,000
Agent Walker?

85
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:59,170
Go ahead, I'm listening.

86
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,240
Larry, it's Janis.

87
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:03,010
Ryan Burnett is dead.

88
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:04,670
How?

89
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,310
Bauer was interrogating him when it happened,

90
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:07,780
and we're responsible.

91
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:09,750
You're saying that Bauer killed Burnett?

92
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:10,950
I don't know.

93
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:13,080
He escaped before i could get to him.

94
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:14,740
He called me, said he was being

95
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,320
set up and he wouldn't come in.

96
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,420
I lost him, Janis.

97
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:22,590
I lost him, and it's on me to find him.

98
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:23,930
Just tell me what you need.

99
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:26,460
I already sent out a priority, all-agency APB.

100
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:28,130
I need you to follow up on that.

101
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,500
I'm coming back to the office right now.

102
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:33,100
I'll coordinate the search operation from there.

103
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:35,140
Okay.

104
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:37,040
Open an all-agency channel

105
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,840
with flags for immediate action on Jack Bauer.

106
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:40,340
I'll make sure the local police departments

107
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:41,340
are linked in.

108
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:42,350
On it. Thank you.

109
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:43,710
Janis, what did Larry say?

110
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,180
Jack get anything out of Burnett?

111
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,250
You're suspended.

112
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,550
I cannot discuss this with you.

113
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,950
Janis, this was my case.

114
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,950
Tell me if Jack got anything out of Burnett.

115
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:53,220
Burnett is dead.

116
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:55,120
Well, tell me what happened.

117
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:58,030
Bauer was there, and now he's missing.

118
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:00,560
Janis, the channel is open.

119
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:01,630
Thank you.

120
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,130
That's all I know, honestly.

121
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,200
So, please, let me get back to work, okay?

122
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:11,870
Please attach Jack Bauer's profile to the APB.

123
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,930
Got you.

124
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:46,610
Walker.

125
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,610
Renee, it's Jack.

126
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,050
Don't hang up the phone, please.

127
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:51,250
Whatever they told you, I did not kill Burnett.

128
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,380
Renee?

129
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:54,550
Yeah.

130
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,690
Bill was right.

131
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:56,950
There are still very powerful people

132
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,660
involved in this conspiracy that were not named

133
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,160
in Dubaku's drive.

134
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,490
They're trying to cover their tracks.

135
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,460
They killed Burnett, and they're framing me for it.

136
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,130
Even if I wanted to help you, Jack,

137
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,000
Larry has every law enforcement agency within 100 miles

138
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:08,630
looking for you, and I have been suspended.

139
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,900
All I want you to do is make an ID.

140
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:12,500
I got a frame grab from the hospital's surveillance.

141
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:13,540
I sent you a photo

142
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,940
of the man who did kill Burnett.

143
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:17,340
It's in your inbox.

144
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:22,780
Renee, this man is the only 
connection I have to whoever else

145
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:24,110
is involved in this thing.

146
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:27,420
Please, I need your help.

147
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:28,760
Look, I know you don't agree

148
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,220
with some of thing I did today but ...

149
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:34,260
I'm telling you the truth.

150
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:37,760
Renee?

151
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:40,760
You know what?

152
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:41,930
Forget it. I'm - I'm sorry.

153
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I made a mistake.

154
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,830
I'll call you back at this number.

155
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,240
Metro police,

156
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:53,610
this is the FBI reporting.

157
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,080
We have a suspect, Jack Bauer, that's escaped custody.

158
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:57,950
All available units, please respond.

159
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,020
Yes, Quinn.

160
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:09,930
Bauer got away from the FBI.

161
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:10,960
How?

162
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:13,460
Well, Bauer is an
extremely impressive operative.

163
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:15,200
You don't have to tell me that.

164
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:18,100
But the FBI has launched a major effort to apprehend him.

165
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:20,370
He won't be able to avoid them for long.

166
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,540
Well, we'll see, won't we?

167
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:24,010
Monitor the situation, keep me apprised.

168
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:25,240
Yes, sir.

169
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:29,510
If Bauer connects us to Juma,

170
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,690
it could seriously impede this operation.

171
00:07:31,691 --> 00:07:33,620
Yes, it could.

172
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:36,790
Is the shipment on time?

173
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:39,360
Yes. Due into port in the next hour.

174
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,620
Then I don't foresee a problem.

175
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:43,160
Once the weapons are deployed,

176
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:46,315
then it doesn't matter what Mr. Bauer or anyone else knows.

177
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,330
Something wrong?

178
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,840
No, sir.

179
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:56,340
Mr. Seaton, I get no pleasure

180
00:07:56,410 --> 00:08:01,140
from the knowledge that people will die at our hands.

181
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:05,180
One single soul, the loss of one soul is tragic to me,

182
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,580
let alone the numbers we're talking about!

183
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:09,620
But do not forget that every war

184
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:11,860
worth fighting involves collateral damage.

185
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,660
And what we're doing

186
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,060
is fundamentally and absolutely necessary!

187
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:18,060
And I know you understand that!

188
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:20,430
Of course.

189
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:30,370
Wake up our colleagues

190
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,340
and have them assembled in one hour.

191
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:35,310
And tell them to pack their pajamas and their toothbrushes.

192
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:37,650
It's gonna be a long night.

193
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,000
Yeah?

194
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:52,700
- I have an I.D.
- Who is it?

195
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,860
John Quinn.

196
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:55,300
Black ops combat vet.

197
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:57,070
Served tours all over the world.

198
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:58,640
Now he works for Starkwood.

199
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,000
The defense consultants?

200
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:01,440
Uh, yeah, they started out as consultants,

201
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:03,340
but over the past few years, while you were

202
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:04,940
out of the country, the pentagon outsourced

203
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:06,980
billions of dollars in contracts to them.

204
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:07,980
What kind of contracts?

205
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:09,410
Manpower.

206
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,050
Starkwood's basically a private army.

207
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:12,750
They recruit ex-soldiers and swat team members

208
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,250
from around the world,

209
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,420
then they hire them back to the military security teams.

210
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:19,290
We're talking thousands of men deployed here and abroad.

211
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,620
Starkwood work with Juma?

212
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:22,630
Well, if they did, it wasn't on the books.

213
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:25,660
But, you know, if anyone knows, it's Senator Mayer.

214
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:28,100
Why Mayer?

215
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:29,530
After he dismantled CTU,

216
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,830
He launched several other investigations.

217
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,500
One of them has been looking at Starkwood.

218
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:34,040
What were they accused of?

219
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,440
The hearings are classified, but

220
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:38,410
supposedly, Mayer has enough to put them out of business.

221
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,040
Okay, I'm gonna need to talk to him.

222
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:41,680
See if you can access the CIRG logs.

223
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,250
They should have a location on him.

224
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:46,280
Okay. I'll send you Mayer's location as soon as I have it.

225
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:47,550
Thanks.

226
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,020
Agent Walker still here?

227
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:53,320
She was just in her office.

228
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:54,860
But there's somebody waiting to see you

229
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:56,530
in the conference room. They need to...

230
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:23,290
Just have a few more forms to fill out,

231
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:24,320
then I'm taking off.

232
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,190
You hear what happened at the hospital?

233
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:29,630
After everything that Jack's done today,

234
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:31,360
do you really believe that he murdered Burnett?

235
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,630
I don't know.

236
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,360
I... I don't care.

237
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:37,370
He's a federal fugitive and needs to be found.

238
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:40,940
But you think it's possible that he did this?

239
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:44,040
'Cause I'm not sure I do.

240
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,140
It's been a long day.

241
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:51,190
Go home, get some sleep.

242
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,220
- I'll call you in the morning.
- Okay.

243
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:05,130
Excuse me, Larry.

244
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,730
Morris O'Brian is waiting in the conference room.

245
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,970
He wants to know why his wife is in holding.

246
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,940
Renee talked to Bauer.

247
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,320
How do you know?

248
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:20,240
Access her phone log for the last 15 minutes

249
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:21,330
and get into her workstation,

250
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:22,410
find out what she's been doing.

251
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,080
All right.

252
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:26,620
If we want to catch Bauer, she's our best shot.

253
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,690
Okay.

254
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:38,630
We've received confirmation that president Taylor

255
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:40,530
will be making a statement to the country shortly.

256
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,900
She is expected to address the attack on the white house

257
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:44,670
that ended an hour ago in a startling rescue.

258
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:47,230
Now, based on the few details we have,

259
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,740
We do know the rescue resulted in the death

260
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,370
of General Juma and all of his forces.

261
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,480
Angela, how much lead time does the media need,

262
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,710
once I'm finished with my revisions?

263
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:00,010
The major outlets will put us on immediately.

264
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,320
I'll be done shortly.

265
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:02,680
Thank you, Angela.

266
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,360
I have a thought

267
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:10,020
about the speech, if you'd like to hear it.

268
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:11,190
Of course.

269
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:13,830
Right now your main thrust is reassurance.

270
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,760
The attacks are behind us,

271
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:17,500
everything's going to be back to normal.

272
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,530
But I think you're missing an opportunity here.

273
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,400
To do what?

274
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:23,140
Claim victory.

275
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:25,040
To say that Juma's death means standing up

276
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:27,110
to tyranny works, and that your decision

277
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,540
to send troops into Sangala was the right one.

278
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:31,480
I'm not sure that this is

279
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,550
the appropriate time to sound triumphant, Livy.

280
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:36,020
A lot of lives were lost today.

281
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:39,120
And by addressing those deaths, you give them meaning.

282
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:40,990
Those people are heroes,

283
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,490
who died in a war that was worth fighting.

284
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:46,730
Let's work it in.

285
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,970
Come in.

286
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,270
Madam president, I have some troubling news.

287
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:02,080
May I speak with you alone?

288
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:04,250
You may speak freely in front of Olivia.

289
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:11,350
Just after the attack on the white house,

290
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:12,790
Jack Bauer came forward

291
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:14,390
with a disturbing claim.

292
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,090
He said there were people

293
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,960
still at large who were involved in the conspiracy...

294
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:21,560
persons unknown who had helped Juma

295
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:23,400
plan and execute the attacks.

296
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,800
Did Bauer have any evidence of this?

297
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:27,400
Nothing concrete.

298
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:29,940
But he promoted the notion that Ryan Burnett

299
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,510
was our best chance of identifying these people,

300
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:35,340
and Bauer asked to be allowed to question him.

301
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:39,450
This was supposed to be a controlled situation.

302
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:43,880
A ploy to intimidate Burnett into giving up intel.

303
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:48,620
So, I granted Bauer's request.

304
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,990
It was a terrible mistake.

305
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:54,330
What happened, Ethan?

306
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,030
Burnett is dead.

307
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,800
My god...

308
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,370
The evidence suggests

309
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:01,800
that he was killed by Bauer.

310
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:03,600
I don't believe it!

311
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:06,710
His claim of another party being involved in the attacks

312
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:08,710
appear to have been a fabrication.

313
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:10,110
A fabrication.

314
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:12,680
It may have something to do with Bill Buchanan's death.

315
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,010
No one knows.

316
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,380
But madam president,

317
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:17,780
I take full responsibility.

318
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:19,190
I was trying to insulate you.

319
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:21,560
To provide you with deniability

320
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:23,520
in case anything went wrong.

321
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:25,830
Or was it because you thought the president would say no?

322
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:28,930
Olivia.

323
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,400
Where is Bauer now?

324
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:33,930
At large.

325
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,970
The FBI is devoting its full resources to the manhunt.

326
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,910
Let me know the minute they find him.

327
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:41,580
Yes, ma'am.

328
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,180
Madam president...

329
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,950
I'm sorry.

330
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:02,830
Looks like everything.

331
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:14,140
She's on the move.

332
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:23,950
Where's Bauer?

333
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,190
I don't know.

334
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:26,220
Don't you lie to me.

335
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:27,920
We traced two calls from your cell

336
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:29,420
to a phone that was reported stolen.

337
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:32,390
And we know you accessed a classified government database

338
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:35,060
and sent someone's name and address to Bauer.

339
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:38,270
Renee, that makes you an accessory after the fact.

340
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:40,470
Now tell me where he is.

341
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:42,070
I can't.

342
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,540
Damn it!

343
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,440
I still don't believe that he did this.

344
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:47,770
Then explain to me why he's not turning himself in,

345
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,040
and letting us help him find this mysterious third party.

346
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:51,610
Because he was framed and he doesn't trust

347
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,980
our ability to work through it.

348
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:54,550
And, you know, after what we've put him through,

349
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,650
how can you blame him?

350
00:15:56,690 --> 00:16:00,620
You're actually willing to sacrifice everything to protect him.

351
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:05,630
Once Jack finds the evidence, he will call us.

352
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:09,130
You know, Janis is decrpyting what you sent.

353
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,130
It's not going to take her a long time.

354
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,600
We are going to find him.

355
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:15,300
Renee, tell me whose information you sent.

356
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:17,570
I'll let the A.G. know that you're cooperating.

357
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:20,540
I'm sorry, Larry.

358
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,310
Put her in holding.

359
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:26,910
Mirandize her.

360
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,300
Good night, sir.

361
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:50,700
I see you in the morning.

362
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:42,090
Hello?

363
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:50,230
Keep your hands where I can see them, senator.

364
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,030
Bauer.

365
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:54,030
Take a seat.

366
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:01,380
I know what you did to Ryan Burnett.

367
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,110
I'm not going to let you butcher me like you did him.

368
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:06,380
You want me dead, Bauer,

369
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:08,010
you'll have to kill me where I stand.

370
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,480
If I wanted to kill you, senator,

371
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:10,480
You'd be dead already.

372
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:12,050
Now take a seat!

373
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:24,800
You're a real enigma, Bauer.

374
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:27,900
An hour after you save the president from terrorists,

375
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:30,400
You murder a federal witness in cold blood.

376
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:32,240
I didn't kill Burnett.

377
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:33,610
This man did.

378
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,110
Do you know who he is?

379
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,210
No.

380
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,310
His name is John Quinn.

381
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,380
He works for Starkwood.

382
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:42,220
What in the world does Starkwood have to do with this?

383
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,380
I don't know yet.

384
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:45,470
But I do know they sent someone to kill Burnett

385
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:46,870
and frame me to cover up their involvement

386
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:48,090
in everything that's happened today,

387
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,920
including the attack on the white house.

388
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:53,960
That's a hell of a theory, Bauer.

389
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:56,330
But you'll have to spin a better story than that

390
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,160
if you expect it to get you off the hook.

391
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:00,100
Senator, I did not come here to clear my name.

392
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:01,940
I'm trying to understand

393
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,100
the connection between Juma and Starkwood.

394
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:06,040
There isn't one.

395
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,780
I've spent the better part of six months

396
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,250
investigating starkwood.

397
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,780
If there was a connection to Juma or Sangala,

398
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:14,820
I would know it.

399
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,480
I want to see every file you have

400
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:18,150
concerning that investigation.

401
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,950
Look...

402
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:25,230
Starkwood has let their security teams run amok

403
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:29,030
all over the world, with no oversight.

404
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,660
They've bribed their way into large contracts,

405
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:32,600
they've tried to influence foreign policy

406
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:35,000
to their own benefit-- all good reasons

407
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:36,970
why this country should not be outsourcing

408
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:41,170
its military operations to private corporations.

409
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:45,210
And I am going to shut them down.

410
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,650
But there is nothing to remotely suggest

411
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,050
they'd be involved in terrorist attacks on their own country

412
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,920
for any amount of money.

413
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:56,490
Maybe they have different reasons for helping Juma.

414
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,090
Like what?

415
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,590
I don't know.

416
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:01,830
Sir, I believe this country is still under attack,

417
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,360
and there has to be a reason.

418
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:07,230
And I'm supposed to believe this, coming from a man who's holding me hostage?

419
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:11,140
I need access to those files.

420
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,780
And if the connection

421
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,850
between Juma and Starkwood isn't there,

422
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:20,910
will you turn yourself in, then?

423
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:26,390
Just open the files, sir.

424
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:44,470
Ladies and gentlemen,

425
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:47,410
the president will be making a brief statement tonight.

426
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:49,910
Good luck, mom.

427
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,810
I'm sure you'll understand,

428
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,680
based on the events of today,

429
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:56,380
there will be no opportunity for follow-up questions.

430
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:57,750
Ladies and gentlemen,

431
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:00,790
the president of the United States.

432
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,330
Thank you very much.

433
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,930
Thank you.

434
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:19,200
Thank you.

435
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,240
My fellow americans, John Adams,

436
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:28,580
the first president to take up residence in the white house,

437
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:30,820
once prayed for heaven to bestow

438
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,820
its blessings on this place.

439
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:36,250
Tonight, those blessings have seen us through

440
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,990
a brutal attack by a desperate tyrant.

441
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:43,000
We have lost friends and loved ones here,

442
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:45,700
but we have prevailed.

443
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,100
I have commanded law enforcement agencies,

444
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,140
emergency services and first responders

445
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,440
to keep their deployment level...

446
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,770
Mr. Kanin, Ken Dellao, CNB.

447
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,070
I'm wondering if you can confirm some information

448
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,570
I received a short time ago?

449
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,280
Ken, this is clearly not the time...

450
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:01,810
Yeah, I'm, I'm going to be reporting in this evening's broadcast

451
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,780
that a rogue ex-federal agent named Jack Bauer

452
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:07,690
is the prime suspect in the murder of Ryan Burnett.

453
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:10,460
... cannot forget today's events.

454
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,620
The lives we lost ...

455
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:12,920
Where did you get this?

456
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:14,860
So, it's true, then?

457
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:16,530
I'm not confirming anything.

458
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:20,030
I'll also be reporting that you authorized Bauer's release from custody

459
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:24,040
and arranged for his access to the victim.

460
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:27,970
...daughters and sons, brothers and sisters,

461
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,210
but they have not taken our spirit.

462
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:33,050
Make no mistake, today's attacks

463
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:34,810
were intended to crush our resolve.

464
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,250
Mr. Kanin.

465
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,720
I said no comment.

466
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:40,720
But america is not so easily broken.

467
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:44,960
Our military action in Sangala has been a success.

468
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:47,440
At this hour,our forces

469
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,490
have taken control of Sangala City.

470
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,730
We have won.

471
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,570
I see you're back to your old tactics.

472
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:55,270
What?

473
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:57,240
You leaked the story of Burnett's murder

474
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,770
and my involvement to the press.

475
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:01,440
Ethan, I don't know what you're talking about.

476
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:10,120
Olivia, don't bother denying it.

477
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,980
I can count on one hand the number of people

478
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:14,520
who knew I'd authorized Bauer's release.

479
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:16,790
So another one of your errors in

480
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:18,860
judgment bites you have

481
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:22,390
and you think you can lay the blame on me.

482
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:24,100
Do you realize what you've done?

483
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,470
In trying to hurt me,

484
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:29,700
you'll have caused tremendous damage to your mother.

485
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:32,200
The president has gone on record

486
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:36,710
that torture is unacceptable under any circumstances.

487
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:39,540
When this gets out, it will look like Bauer was sent

488
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:40,610
exactly for that.

489
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,210
It'll be a political disaster.

490
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,780
You've gone too far this time.

491
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:45,780
I'm not listening to you anymore.

492
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:47,490
I'm not going to let you get away with this.

493
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:49,250
Get your hands off me.

494
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:53,060
As americans,

495
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:54,760
we should stand together proud

496
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:55,990
of what we have achieved.

497
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:59,760
Thanks to the efforts and the sacrifices

498
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:04,640
of so many, this place, our national home,

499
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:07,510
stands tall tonight.

500
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:11,480
And all our citizens can sleep soundly with the knowledge

501
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:16,810
that the blessings of freedom continue to shine upon us all.

502
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,950
No, there's been no sign of Bauer in the northeast sector,

503
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:22,620
so expand your cordon to the 25-mile mark.

504
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:24,690
And be prepared to back up metro.

505
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:27,390
I'm directing them to begin random traffic stops, citywide.

506
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:29,290
Thank you.

507
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,330
I isolated the data Renee uploaded to Bauer,

508
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,030
but I can't get past the file header.

509
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,430
What does that mean?

510
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,200
She encrypted the name and address she used,

511
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:38,870
and I can't seem to crack it.

512
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:41,240
You can't? She used her personal computer.

513
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,640
This is very serious encryption.

514
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:46,280
- I mean, there are some high-level people who can do it.
- Like who?

515
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:47,910
Chloe O'Brian-- but from what you've

516
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:49,380
told me, she's still loyal to Bauer.

517
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:52,320
Is her husband still here?

518
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,420
Yeah. He's waiting to see you.

519
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:58,420
According to her file, he's a level-six analyst, too.

520
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:01,560
I have no idea how much longer I'm going to be here.

521
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:04,300
Just do me a favor and give Prescott his babu

522
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,700
before you put him down.

523
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:10,000
Yeah, I'm going to have to call you back. Yeah.

524
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:11,840
Mr. O'Brian, I'm Larry Moss.

525
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,640
Yeah, I'd like to see my wife.

526
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:15,870
All right.

527
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:25,520
What the bloody hell are you holding her for?

528
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:28,420
Obstruction, evidence tampering.

529
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:30,360
I think you should be more concerned about

530
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:32,460
what you can do to get her out.
- Sorry?

531
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:34,360
Help us find Jack Bauer.

532
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:38,200
Last I heard from Chloe, Jack was working for the bureau.

533
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:39,560
That's you, if I'm not mistaken.

534
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:41,200
He was.

535
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:43,500
Until he snapped and murdered a federal witness.

536
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:44,940
Really?

537
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,640
I find that hard to believe.

538
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:48,310
All that's relevant here is that your wife

539
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:50,070
is going to be prosecuted for colluding with Bauer,

540
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:51,680
unless you help us find him.

541
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:53,250
Mr. O'Brian,

542
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:55,080
a short time ago,

543
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:57,010
one of our agents was in touch with Jack Bauer.

544
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,120
She sent a name and address

545
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:00,850
that we assume is his next destination.

546
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,690
Unfortunately, it's encrypted with Blowfish 148.

547
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,190
No one here knows how to crack that.

548
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:08,230
Therefore, we need your help.

549
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:10,030
Please.

550
00:26:10,031 --> 00:26:12,320
You have to understand something:

551
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:15,200
Jack Bauer and my wife have a very long history.

552
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:17,030
I consider him to be a friend.

553
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,700
And he'll have his day in court.

554
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:20,040
But the case against your wife

555
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:22,170
is rock solid.

556
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,510
I can't.

557
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:28,580
We're talking about her serving a minimum sentence of 15 years.

558
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:31,820
Your son will be 19 by the time she gets out of prison.

559
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:47,570
I want guarantees of full immunity,

560
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:50,600
no jail time, expulsion of all charges from her record.

561
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:51,700
You have my word.

562
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:53,440
You are a witness to this agreement.

563
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:54,440
Yes.

564
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:56,910
Show me the file.

565
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,040
Original information--

566
00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:00,850
16- or 32-bit word length?
- 32.

567
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:04,150
Native or modified data points?

568
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:06,620
Native.

569
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:11,090
The designer of this algorithm

570
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,720
built a backdoor into his code.

571
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:14,990
Decryption's a piece of cake if you know the override codes.

572
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:16,230
And you do?

573
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:18,100
Yeah.

574
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,030
Will this take long?

575
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,800
'Course not.

576
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:27,240
Mr. O'Brian, can you tell me specifically

577
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:29,410
when you'll have the file decrypted?

578
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,510
Yes.

579
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:35,450
Now.

580
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:38,060
Your agent sent Jack to

581
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:40,620
951 Deerbrook Avenue, Georgetown,

582
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:42,820
Residence of Senator Blaine Mayer.

583
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:44,790
Assemble the field teams.

584
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:48,090
Tell them we have a probable location on Bauer.

585
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,500
And get Metro PD on the way.

586
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:06,600
No luck reaching Mayer on his cell

587
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,690
or at the house.

588
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,860
The phone company said

589
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,290
the line was shorted out on-site.

590
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,390
Yeah, that's Bauer.

591
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:12,790
Why is he doing this?

592
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:14,190
Because Mayer spent the last six months

593
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:16,360
trying to send Bauer to prison for the rest of his life.

594
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:20,630
All right, Metro PD is closing in on Mayer's residence.

595
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,000
I've authorized them to move in

596
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:23,940
as soon as they're in position and at strength.

597
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:28,610
I told them, and I'm telling you,
it is impossible to overestimate Bauer.

598
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,610
He has more training and more experience

599
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,610
than anybody in this room, and that includes myself.

600
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:35,020
Okay, let's move.

601
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,470
Agent Moss will be running on-point tactical

602
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,850
with FBI teams on five.

603
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,390
All units must register and log their com through me,

604
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:45,530
And I will distribute recognition codes and credentials.

605
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,600
Chloe... I can't believe you.

606
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:52,170
You're helping them catch Jack.

607
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,700
I did it for you.

608
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:55,470
This is the last thing I would have wanted.

609
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:57,370
How could you do this? Let's see, for a start,

610
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,240
I thought it might be nice to spare Prescott

611
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:02,410
the inconvenience of having a convict for a mother.

612
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,250
Jack saved your life. I don't deny that I owe him.

613
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:10,050
But my child and my marriage comes first,

614
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,350
and it should for you, too.

615
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:14,860
Chloe, love, you've helped Jack enough.

616
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,720
You have.

617
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:22,400
And you can't go deciding to make
this sacrifice on your own any more.

618
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:25,170
But he didn't do what they're saying he did.

619
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:27,930
Then he can prove that when they take him into custody.

620
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,670
If they give him the chance.

621
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:50,120
At the hearing this morning, you said you had no regrets

622
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:51,760
about what you've done.

623
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:55,730
But what I saw was a man full of regret.

624
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:58,230
Of course I have regrets, senator.

625
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:04,070
I regret losing my family.

626
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:07,070
My wife was murdered because I was responsible

627
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:12,180
for protecting David Palmer
during an assassination attempt.

628
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:14,280
My daughter can't even look at me.

629
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:17,420
Every day, I regret looking into the eyes

630
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,250
of men, women and children,

631
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,650
knowing that, any moment,

632
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,790
their lives might be deemed expendable

633
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:24,790
in an effort to protect the greater good.

634
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:29,630
I regret every decision or mistake I might have made

635
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:33,500
that resulted in the loss of a single innocent life.

636
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:36,670
But you know what I regret the most?

637
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:40,440
Is that this world even needs people like me.

638
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:44,240
So you think I'm naive to believe

639
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:46,580
we need to hold ourselves
to a higher standard of combat?

640
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:49,580
Doesn't even matter what I think, senator.

641
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:51,280
You just need to understand where I work,

642
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:54,050
things get a lot messier
than where you work on the hill.

643
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:59,360
What you've lost, Mr. Bauer, is tragic.

644
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:01,390
What you've been compelled to do

645
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:05,030
in the name of saving innocent life is tragic.

646
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:10,300
Sometimes we need to
incur the most horrible losses

647
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:12,510
in order to uphold the ideals

648
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:14,470
that this country was founded on.

649
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:17,340
How can we presume to lead the world

650
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:20,080
unless we set an example?

651
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:23,850
You make it sound so simple.

652
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,790
Well, maybe it's simpler than you think.

653
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:27,790
Maybe all the things that you've seen

654
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:30,260
and all the things that you've done
have clouded of your vision.

655
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,700
Look at this.

656
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:41,370
Tell me about this car accident.

657
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,470
That has nothing to do with Juma.

658
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:44,770
Who was the victim?

659
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,110
A source inside of Starkwood.

660
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:47,470
A whistle-blower.

661
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:48,940
Unfortunately, he was also a drunk.

662
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:51,040
He was killed when he wrecked his car

663
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:52,480
on the way home from Atlantic City.

664
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:54,910
Blood alcohol off the charts.

665
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:01,690
Senator, this was no accident.

666
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,720
Your informant was murdered by the same man

667
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:05,390
who took Ryan Burnett out this evening.

668
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:06,790
What does this mean, Bauer?

669
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:09,060
They were scared of what he had to say.

670
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:10,600
What does your informant have on starkwood?

671
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:11,930
He made a lot of wild accusations,

672
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,970
But not a single one of them panned out.

673
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,540
Maybe you didn't dig deep enough.

674
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,540
Senator, I need to know exactly what he told you.

675
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,710
He alleged that Starkwood

676
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:21,370
was blackmailing pentagon officials.

677
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,740
That they were involved in assassination plots.

678
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:26,350
Even that they were seeking to acquire their own WMDs.

679
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:27,680
Specifically what?

680
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:29,420
Well, I don't remember, but I'm sure

681
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,120
that his interview transcript should be there.

682
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,760
Okay, I got it.

683
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:38,020
Oh, my god.

684
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:39,190
That's it.

685
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:40,330
What?

686
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:41,490
Your informant claims that Starkwood

687
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,200
was trying to acquire a bioweapon.

688
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,600
That's your connection to Juma.

689
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:45,630
I don't understand.

690
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,400
When Juma was in power, it was rumored

691
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:49,470
That he was running an illegal weapons program.

692
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:51,240
He was developing a bioweapon,

693
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:52,440
but nobody could prove it.

694
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:54,110
But the people that I knew in Sangala

695
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:56,910
believed he was testing
these weapons on his own population.

696
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:58,180
He used a remote village,

697
00:32:58,250 --> 00:32:59,610
released some kind of pathogen.

698
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,850
Everyone there was struck with dementia,

699
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:04,120
paralysis and eventually died.

700
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:05,720
Why wasn't this pursued?

701
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:07,150
'Cause Juma destroyed all the evidence.

702
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,590
He firebombed the village before anyone

703
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:10,320
could get there, and UN officials

704
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:12,790
had a hard time believing
that Juma had the technology

705
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:14,930
or expertise to develop such a weapon.

706
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,560
But Starkwood... they had both.

707
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:19,670
The technology and the expertise.

708
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:21,870
And what did Juma have to offer Starkwood?

709
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:23,800
A safe haven to develop the weapon

710
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:26,610
and an endless supply of victims to test it on.

711
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:29,940
Even if all this was true, why in the world

712
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:32,210
would Starkwood want a bioweapon?

713
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,980
Senator, you've been trying to dismantle Starkwood

714
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:36,620
for the last six months.

715
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,650
Maybe they planned on fighting back.

716
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,750
But regardless, if they have a weapon like this,

717
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:43,320
you better believe they intend to use it.

718
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:45,930
Senator Mayer!

719
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:46,930
This is Metro PD!

720
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:49,000
Don't you move.

721
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:55,270
Hold on. Hold on!

722
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:58,200
You're obviously on to something.

723
00:33:58,270 --> 00:33:59,540
They can help you

724
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:01,740
find the evidence you need to prove your case.

725
00:34:01,810 --> 00:34:04,140
Right now everyone thinks
I killed Ryan Burnett.

726
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:06,280
- No one's gonna listen to me.
- I can protect you.

727
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:07,780
I can order them to help us.

728
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:09,120
Starkwood infiltrated the white house.

729
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:11,480
As soon as they find out you're going after them

730
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:13,120
for a bioweapon, they'll bury the evidence.

731
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:15,960
Then we'll keep the circle small.

732
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,890
I can make this happen.

733
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:20,360
It's time for you to start trusting the institutions

734
00:34:20,430 --> 00:34:23,860
that you've sacrificed so much to protect.

735
00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:25,870
Trust isn't my greatest asset.

736
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:28,540
Son, you have to start somewhere.

737
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:31,670
Senator!

738
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:33,410
This is Metro PD!

739
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:35,610
You really think you can do this?

740
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,480
I know I can.

741
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:41,450
Let 'em in.

742
00:34:54,930 --> 00:34:56,660
No!

743
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:54,760
You wanted to see me?

744
00:35:54,830 --> 00:35:57,760
Yes, Livy.

745
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,630
Ethan just come to me with something very disturbing.

746
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:03,570
I assume it's about the press leak regarding Jack Bauer.

747
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:08,210
Ethan seems to think you had something to do with it.

748
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:09,610
I didn't.

749
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,310
I already told him that.

750
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:12,980
Well, given the past experience

751
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:15,310
between the two of you,
he's not convinced.

752
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:17,480
And what do you think?

753
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:20,390
I think I need to hear what you have to say.

754
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:22,320
There's nothing she can say,
madam president.

755
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:24,160
She was one of the few people

756
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:25,720
who knew all the details.

757
00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:28,660
More people knew than you think.

758
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:30,620
I just got off the phone with the

759
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:32,230
white house secretary producer

760
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:33,400
at CNB.

761
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:35,000
He won't give me the source's name,

762
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:36,230
but he's willing to confirm

763
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:38,400
that the leak came from
someone inside the federal

764
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:39,870
Marshal's office.

765
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:42,410
He'll guarantee it didn't
come from the white house,

766
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,880
or from me.

767
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,280
This is verifiable?

768
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:51,080
Producer's name is Charlie Isakson.

769
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:52,780
Here's his number.

770
00:36:52,850 --> 00:36:54,620
You can call him yourself if you'd like.

771
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,430
I offered Isakson some

772
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,300
exclusive time with you if he killed the story,

773
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,100
and he agreed.

774
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:09,100
So as long as we get Bauer in custody,

775
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:11,170
we should be able to
keep the fallout contained.

776
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,210
Ethan, under the circumstances,

777
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:16,110
I think it seems clear

778
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:18,180
that you were mistaken.

779
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:21,580
I'm satisfied.

780
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:22,750
Are you?

781
00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:25,220
Yes, madam president.

782
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,720
I'm sorry, Olivia,

783
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:28,620
if I misjudged

784
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:30,320
the situation...

785
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:31,790
and you.

786
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,480
I want to know

787
00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:36,560
if the FBI's any closer to finding Bauer.

788
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:38,160
Yes, ma'am.

789
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:40,530
That's all.

790
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,680
I'm sorry

791
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:53,410
- I put you on the spot like that.
- I understand.

792
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,410
Ethan didn't give you much of a choice.

793
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,610
I just hope

794
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:59,280
they find Bauer before this gets any worse.

795
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:19,380
You're dying.

796
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:21,020
Just tell me where

797
00:41:21,090 --> 00:41:23,290
the weapons are coming in.

798
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:25,360
When are they getting here?

799
00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:28,190
They're already here.

800
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,000
Janis, it's Larry.

801
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:07,900
We got here too late.

802
00:42:07,970 --> 00:42:09,730
Bauer murdered Senator Mayer.

803
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:12,370
Escalate the search for him to region-wide.

804
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,510
I want reinforcements from every branch

805
00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:16,570
within 50 miles brought into this.

806
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:17,640
Copy that.

807
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:18,910
At this point...

808
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:22,310
orders are to shoot on sight.

809
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:26,780
Yeah.

810
00:42:26,850 --> 00:42:28,050
Tony, it's Jack.

811
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:29,850
Jack, I've been monitoring the FBI bandwidth.

812
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,290
What the hell's going on?

813
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:33,220
Listen, man, I need your help.
Where are you?

814
00:42:33,290 --> 00:42:34,660
3rd Street and B.

815
00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:35,990
Okay, listen to me, I need you

816
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:37,500
to meet me at the Port of Alexandria.

817
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:39,560
I need you to bring weapons and a surveillance package.

818
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:41,670
- Get there as soon as possible.
- Jack, wait.

819
00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:45,470
I can't. I'll get back
to you as soon as I'm en route.
