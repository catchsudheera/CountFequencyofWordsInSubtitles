1
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,958
- Fayed has the bombs.
- Where is he?

2
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:20,157
I don't know, but I can help you find him.

3
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:25,478
Preparing the tracker now.
We can track up to 15 miles.

4
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,439
And we are locked on the isotope signature
that's being emitted from Gredenko's arm.

5
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:33,115
- You led them to me.
- I had no choice.

6
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,156
I don't like it. Something's wrong.
I'm heading in.

7
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,514
Which direction, Milo?

8
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,068
<i>He stopped
and entered the building on the left.</i>

9
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,674
<i>(Jack) Milo, no one's in here.</i>

10
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,309
My God! They cut off Gredenko's arm!
Ryan, move your men in now!

11
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,833
I want Fayed alive.

12
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,715
- We're trapped.
- This way.

13
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:56,476
I recognise him from the news!
It's the terrorist they're looking for!

14
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:59,074
<i>- (man) That is him.
- You bastard.</i>

15
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,396
Back off!

16
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,517
Gredenko is not here.
Lock down the area, initiate a search.

17
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,151
One of the cabinet votes is invalid.

18
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,119
The tally's seven to six in favour
of invoking the 25th Amendment

19
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,760
and removing President Palmer from power.

20
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,193
I'm sorry, Wayne.

21
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:27,354
Noah, don't waste your apologies on me,
because I won't let you steal the presidency.

22
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,955
As I'm sure you're aware, sir,

23
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,350
conspiracy to commit perjury
is a felony offence.

24
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:37,989
<i>(Lisa) My affidavit will push the court
to rule in your favour so that you can do</i>

25
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:41,675
<i>- what's right for this country.
- (Daniels) You're right. Do it.</i>

26
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,988
Turn it off.

27
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:46,959
Wayne. The Supreme Court was just notified
Daniels withdrew his suit.

28
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,315
You're still the President of the United States.

29
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,192
- President Palmer.
- What?

30
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,874
He's about to go ahead
with the nuclear strike.

31
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,155
This makes no sense, sir.

32
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,631
- It's what you risked your life to stop!
- I risked my life to reassert my authority.

33
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,270
Mr President.

34
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,591
- We have a successful launch.
- Good.

35
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,189
Mr President...
the missile is just entering target's airspace.

36
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,271
- Mr President...
- I'm done talking.

37
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,318
We both agreed a nuclear strike is pointless.

38
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:38,679
Fayed's actions are not state-sponsored
and his country cannot be held accountable.

39
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,512
Five minutes to impact.

40
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:45,151
The ambassador assured us his country's
doing everything possible to find the nukes.

41
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,117
They simply don't know anything.

42
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,834
One way or another, Tom,
we're about to find out if that's true.

43
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,592
<i>- Buchanan.
- It's me.</i>

44
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,389
- Have you gotten anything from Fayed?
- Jack's interrogating him.

45
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:07,268
He's not optimistic about breaking him.
What's going on?

46
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,590
The president's gone ahead with the strike.

47
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,830
- He what?!
- He's launched it, Bill.

48
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,911
- Why?
- I don't know why.

49
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,118
He fought the vice president and now
he's just going ahead with Daniels' plan.

50
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:23,035
It doesn't make any sense.
We've gotta stop this.

51
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,912
Bill, can I tell the president
that you have a solid lead from Fayed

52
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,639
on the location
of the suitcase nukes?

53
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,235
Provide a pretext to bring the missile down?
Karen, I can't do that.

54
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,357
Fayed's not talking, Gredenko's dead.
I don't have anything.

55
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,032
OK. OK.

56
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,676
- I'm sorry.
- Me too.

57
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,751
I'll call you later.

58
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,434
Sir, we have confirmation
their radar's tagged the missile.

59
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,993
They're scrambling fighters
and readying air defences.

60
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,957
They know we're coming. Good.

61
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,350
I just got off the phone with CTU.
Bauer's interrogating Fayed.

62
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:06,672
- He'll soon have the location of those bombs.
- No, Karen. We can't afford to wait.

63
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:11,436
Sir, we can't afford not to.
Please, why are you doing this?

64
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,592
Four minutes to impact, Mr President.

65
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,912
<i>(Tom) Mr President.</i>

66
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,991
<i>(phone beeps)</i>

67
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,513
<i>- Yes?
- (woman) Excuse me.</i>

68
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:38,072
<i>- We have the ambassador for the president.
- This is President Palmer.</i>

69
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,597
My government has alerted me of the nuclear
weapon heading toward my country.

70
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,478
That's correct.
We've made good on our threat.

71
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:49,633
- For God's sake, I implore you to stop it.
- On what grounds?

72
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:53,315
We have uncovered new information
regarding your situation.

73
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,069
I'm listening.

74
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,709
We have identified a general
in central command, Mohmar Habib,

75
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,791
who has also been in contact with Fayed.

76
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,316
It's our belief he's been helping
orchestrate the attacks.

77
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,075
- Have you arrested Habib?
- Yes, yes. He's being interrogated.

78
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,072
Please, you must abort this attack
before it's too late.

79
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:14,755
Does Habib know the present location
of Fayed's nuclear weapons?

80
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:19,197
It is my understanding his last contact
with Fayed was during the drone operation.

81
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,478
He has no current knowledge of the weapons'
whereabouts or intended targets.

82
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:27,394
Mr President... two minutes to impact, sir.

83
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:35,074
Ambassador, your government has known
about this man for some time, haven't they?

84
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,833
Mr President,
this development has come as a shock.

85
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,672
Stop lying to me!

86
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:44,072
That missile will hit in less than two minutes,
so please don't try my patience again.

87
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,755
You must understand
the fragile political climate of our country.

88
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,673
General Habib
is a high-ranking military commander.

89
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:56,630
I really hope protecting this man was worth
pushing us to the brink of World War III.

90
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,516
The missile will be aborted.

91
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,878
But in the meantime, I strongly suggest
you get me a full dossier on General Habib.

92
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,679
I want a thorough update on his interrogation.

93
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:15,072
<i>I'm also demanding that you return here
to the White House immediately.</i>

94
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:19,358
I want direct access to you, sir,
for the duration of this crisis.

95
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,271
As you wish, Mr President.

96
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:28,832
Commander, abort code
alpha, zero, delta, nine.

97
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,994
Ditch it in the Gulf.

98
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:38,315
My God, they were lying to us all the time,
withholding information, and you knew it.

99
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,119
I suspected it.

100
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:46,511
<i>Well, I'll see that the Vickery sends a recovery
team to retrieve that nuclear warhead.</i>

101
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,511
That won't be necessary, Tom.

102
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:52,957
<i>The president ordered the launch of
a secondary missile on board the Vickery.</i>

103
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:56,237
- An unarmed one.
- What?!

104
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,436
This was all a bluff?

105
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:02,638
The vice president was right,
well, about one thing, anyway -

106
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,510
that it was gonna take a willingness to strike
back before getting any real cooperation.

107
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:12,116
The difference is I wasn't about to take
innocent lives to prove my point.

108
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:18,230
Now, let's get this information to CTU.
Perhaps it's the key to breaking Fayed.

109
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:33,549
This country is planning
a retaliatory strike against your people.

110
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,473
I can stop it,
but tell me where the bombs are.

111
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,551
Where are the bombs?!

112
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,312
Fayed, this is over. You lost.
Save your people.

113
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,551
Just tell me where the bombs are.

114
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:53,636
Are you enjoying yourself, Bauer? As much
as you enjoyed butchering my little brother?

115
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:58,316
Your brother was responsible
for the death of dozens of innocent lives.

116
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,631
Now you're responsible for thousands.

117
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:06,070
Trust me, I haven't begun to enjoy myself.

118
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:11,836
Go ahead.
You'll get nothing from me and you know it.

119
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,911
We'll see.

120
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,831
<i>(coughs)</i>

121
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,668
- This is not working.
- Let me have a go at him.

122
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,399
No. That's exactly what he wants.

123
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:28,233
He knows he's lost.
He wants us to martyr him.

124
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,719
<i>(phone rings)</i>

125
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,075
Hold on.

126
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:36,073
- This is Bauer.
- It's Bill. What's your status with Fayed?

127
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,993
Same as before. We're getting nowhere.

128
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,435
I've just got new intel
from the White House.

129
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:45,274
Fayed's government arrested
one of its generals - Mohmar Habib.

130
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,636
He's been running Fayed,
helping him coordinate the attacks.

131
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,109
- Then Habib knows where Fayed's men are.
- No.

132
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,557
He claims there's been no contact since
the drone attack. They're interrogating him.

133
00:08:55,640 --> 00:09:00,634
Unless Habib gives us something more
useful, we have no location for these bombs.

134
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,030
We have to try something more drastic.

135
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:07,795
- How soon can Fayed be transported?
- Immediately, but we've got a play.

136
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:11,873
You really think you'll be remembered
as some great martyr for your people?

137
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:15,032
You blew up a little city
and you killed a lot of people today,

138
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,432
but let's face it, that's gonna be
of no real political significance.

139
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:24,389
Your number two guy, once he
realises that you're out of the picture,

140
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,792
he's gonna take those remaining suitcase
nukes and blow up a substantial target,

141
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,519
something that's
really gonna hurt this country.

142
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:37,516
If by some chance he succeeds,
he's gonna be the hero of yourjihad,

143
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,750
and you will be forgotten.

144
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,035
Is that what you want?

145
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:48,276
Do you honestly believe you can
manipulate me by playing on my vanity?

146
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,956
I serve the will of God.

147
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:56,272
No, you don't. And if you don't believe me,
ask Him when you meet Him.

148
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,920
Agent Doyle, lower your weapon.

149
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,719
I said, lower you weapon!

150
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,509
Buchanan wants us
to transport Fayed to CTU.

151
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,591
His men are probably on the move.

152
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:12,389
The only way to break him is with a
pharmaceutical package. Burke is ready.

153
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,596
We don't need Burke. Just give me time.

154
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,592
Those are your orders.

155
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,555
Agent Doyle, do you have a problem?

156
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,391
- No problem.
- Good. Get your men ready.

157
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,518
Now we're gonna have some fun.

158
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:51,110
Excuse me, sir. Here's the file on Habib.

159
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:03,359
- Is this the complete dossier on Habib?
- No, sir. It's preliminary.

160
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:08,468
I was told by the ambassador's staff that more
would be forthcoming and relayed to CTU.

161
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,393
Good. How soon
before the ambassador gets here?

162
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,631
Within 15 minutes.
And I spoke with Secret Service.

163
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:19,748
Your sister's on her way back to the hospital
to be with Walid. She's gonna call you soon.

164
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,717
All right. Thank you.

165
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,356
I did want to say...
your handling of the crisis...

166
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,829
I know you're not happy
you were kept in the dark.

167
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,354
The joint chiefs agreed
we keep the plan closed.

168
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:40,993
That's not it. I just want to say I'm sorry
I doubted your strength and your leadership.

169
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,110
It's all right.

170
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:48,113
Well, respectfully, sir, no. It's not all right.

171
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:53,358
Tom, you and I go back a long time.

172
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,916
So let's be honest with each other.

173
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,630
You believed the vice president was better
suited to lead this country through this crisis.

174
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,915
And I was wrong about that, sir.

175
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,355
If that missile
had detonated on foreign soil,

176
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,512
Russia, China,
every nation with a nuclear capability,

177
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:12,354
might have inserted themselves into this.
This could've been a world war.

178
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:18,037
Unfortunately, we're already in a world war.
It's just taken me some time to realise that.

179
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:22,716
If it hadn't have been for Vice President
Daniels, I would've had no gambit to play

180
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:27,669
and the ambassador would never have
come forward with this intel on Habib.

181
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:34,913
I'm not David, Tom, and I never will be,
but I am learning that who I am is not so bad.

182
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,312
Yeah, we're all doing
some learning here today, aren't we, sir?

183
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,871
Tom...

184
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:47,191
Daniels withdrew his challenge
to my competency very suddenly

185
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:51,239
and, from what I know,
without any discernible reason.

186
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:55,871
- Change of heart, maybe?
- Something must have changed it.

187
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,471
You have something on him, don't you?

188
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:05,873
Sir, as chief of staff, I'm here to inform you
and also to protect you.

189
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,793
Those jobs don't always work in combination.

190
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,997
We're northbound on Washington.
ETA about six minutes.

191
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:31,117
Tell Agent Burke
we're gonna need everything he's got.

192
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,318
What if it doesn't work? I've never found
pharmaceutical torture that effective.

193
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,391
<i>- I have.
- (Fayed scoffs)</i>

194
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:42,600
If this is supposed to frighten me, you're
wasting your time. I won't tell you a thing.

195
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,432
Whether you do or not,
I get to watch you suffer.

196
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,829
Agent Doyle, I don't want you talking to...

197
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,797
- Jack!
- Watch out!

198
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,594
- Everybody OK?!
- Yeah.

199
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,995
<i>(men mutter in Arabic language)</i>

200
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:12,436
They're trying to flank us on both sides.
We're sitting ducks here!

201
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:15,796
Try and get Fayed out the back.
I'll cover you from this side.

202
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,916
All right.

203
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,516
<i>(man speaks Arabic language)</i>

204
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,753
<i>(man speaks Arabic language)</i>

205
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,876
We're clear! We're clear!

206
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,230
Bill, it's Jack. Do you copy?

207
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,356
- Bill, do you copy?
- We're here, Jack.

208
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,637
- Cover team just picked up Fayed.
- Do you think he bought it?

209
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,553
We'll know soon enough.

210
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,796
<i>- Is the AVfeed up yet?
- We're almost there.</i>

211
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,319
- Agent Doyle, you're bleeding.
- I must have cut myself in the crash.

212
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:10,633
<i>- Mike, do you need medical assistance?
- No, it's superficial. Thanks for your concern.</i>

213
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,235
<i>- Jack, I'm patching it through to you now.
- Copy that.</i>

214
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,672
<i>(man) Talit, take evasive measures.
Keep off the main streets.</i>

215
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:25,070
<i>(man speaks Arabic language)</i>

216
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:36,278
My name is Jamal Nasawa. We're with
the Al-Tahireen cell. General Habib sent us.

217
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,033
- The general?
- Yes.

218
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:43,079
- How did you find me?
- Through contacts in American intelligence.

219
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:46,470
He learned of your route
and ordered us to intercept.

220
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,553
He wants us to help you
rendezvous with your men.

221
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,796
Give me a gun.

222
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,668
I want to speak to him - General Habib.

223
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:23,194
<i>- That's not possible at the moment.
- Why not?</i>

224
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,636
He's under tight scrutiny
by the government. It's not safe.

225
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:31,840
He said he'll call us when he can.
Fayed, where do you want us to take you?

226
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:35,671
I'll let you know after I speak to the general.

227
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,074
As you wish.

228
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,948
Bill, did you copy? Fayed's not
going anywhere unless he talks to Habib.

229
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:46,556
- I don't know if I can make that happen.
- We've got to, otherwise this falls through.

230
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,200
We have no other way to find the bombs.

231
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:53,831
I'll call the White House.
We need to involve the president.

232
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:13,876
I've got Bill Buchanan on the phone.
I'm patching him through.

233
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:18,829
Bill, you're on speaker with Tom Lennox
and myself. So what's the situation?

234
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:24,233
Jack wasn't able to extract any information
from Fayed. He considered it a dead end.

235
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,471
Consequently, we implemented a plan
intended to trick Fayed

236
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:30,028
into leading us to the suitcase nukes.

237
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,278
- What sort of plan?
- We staged a fake rescue of Fayed

238
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,353
by CTU agents posing as members
of a terrorist cell with loyalties to Habib.

239
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,353
<i>We hoped that Fayed would lead us
to wherever his men are holed up.</i>

240
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,874
- But he hasn't, right?
- No, sir.

241
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:47,953
Fayed is stalling
until he can get confirmation from Habib

242
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,270
that these men are taking orders from him.

243
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:54,353
- He wants to speak to the general, sir.
- Habib is still being interrogated.

244
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:57,512
We don't know how cooperative he's being
or even if he will be.

245
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,957
I appreciate that, sir. Our agents on the inside
are trying to circumvent his request,

246
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:05,828
but Jack believes Fayed will not
lead us to the location of the nukes

247
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,354
unless he speaks directly to the general.

248
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:14,793
- Where is the ambassador now?
- He just arrived. Karen is meeting him.

249
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,476
I'll do my best to pressure the ambassador.
Maybe they can force Habib to make that call.

250
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:22,836
Keep doing what you can,
just in case I'm not successful.

251
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,478
Yes, sir. We'll keep you apprised.

252
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:27,279
- All right.
- Sir, if this ruse isn't working,

253
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:31,672
we might be better off getting information
out of Fayed by conventional means.

254
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:35,469
If Jack Bauer says that's a dead end,
then I believe him.

255
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:41,192
- Let's not keep the ambassador waiting.
- Whoa! Are you all right, sir?

256
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,271
I'm fine.

257
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,355
- Ambassador.
- Mr President.

258
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:02,797
The prime minister has asked me to convey
his gratitude to you for stopping the attack,

259
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,077
and his relief that a catastrophe
was narrowly avoided.

260
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:12,395
Don't get too comfortable, Mr Ambassador,
because there may be one yet. Sit down.

261
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,399
Let me get right to the point.

262
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:23,315
At this very moment, Abu Fayed is travelling
with CTU agents posing as a terrorist cell

263
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,436
allied with General Habib.

264
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,512
- You have Fayed?
- Yeah, but not the suitcase nukes.

265
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:33,390
The problem is, Fayed will not rendezvous
with his men until he speaks to that general,

266
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:36,995
presumably to confirm the legitimacy
of our undercover agents.

267
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,548
So we need that phone call to take place now.

268
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:43,474
I appreciate your dilemma
and I will gladly pass on your request,

269
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:48,111
but I'm not sure the general will be
accommodating. He has proven stubborn.

270
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,998
Perhaps you should be
a little bit more persuasive.

271
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:54,789
I resent your tone. I don't need you
to tell me how dire the situation is.

272
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,871
This is not a moment for indignation.

273
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,919
It's your country's own inactions
that have brought us to this point.

274
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,549
I can assure you every effort
is being made to get information from him.

275
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,279
We have even arrested his family.

276
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,715
Have you threatened to kill them?

277
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,556
- I beg your pardon?
- Mr President...

278
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:19,873
These are desperate times. I spared you a
nuclear strike that would've killed thousands.

279
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:25,080
<i>What is your country willing to do to ensure
that another bomb does not go off in mine?</i>

280
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:29,676
- What you're suggesting is barbaric.
- I know how your country treats dissonance.

281
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,558
Don't you dare speak to me of barbarism.

282
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:37,917
I don't care how you do it,
but General Habib needs to call Fayed

283
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,120
and give him his orders directly,
without compromising CTU's operation.

284
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,070
You'll make the call now.

285
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:03,148
If Habib makes the call, it'll be to Jamal's
phone, but the general doesn't speak English.

286
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:07,711
I'll set up a separate channel
and translate their conversation.

287
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:13,479
Milo, I need you to uplink a proprietary
channel on socket D to my terminal.

288
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:16,518
I can't. I'm busy.

289
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:20,798
- Why don't you just do it yourself?
- I don't have level-five security clearance.

290
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,350
It hasn't stopped you before, now has it?

291
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:27,955
Milo, is there something on your mind?

292
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:32,636
I... just don't get it. A few hours ago,
Doyle was threatening you, hurting you.

293
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,109
Now you two are best buddies.

294
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:40,228
Just because I show concern for an injured
field agent, it doesn't make us friends.

295
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,118
Milo, besides, he might not be as bad
as you think he is.

296
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,476
No, he is. The guy's a creep and a sadist.

297
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,915
I don't have time. I can have Chloe do it.

298
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,673
That's it? That's all you're gonna say?

299
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,149
Let go of me.

300
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:00,955
Psst. I know it's none of my business,
but do we have a bit of a problem?

301
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,791
No.

302
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:12,757
- I'll set up your channel.
- Thank you.

303
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:23,597
- Are you all right, love?
- Yeah, thanks.

304
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,477
Don't mention it.

305
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:41,635
Pull into that garage up there.
We'll wait there.

<i>(Jack) Right over here.</i>

307
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:07,432
Fayed, I understand your caution,

308
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,637
but we can'tjust sit
while the Americans are looking for us.

309
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:15,396
I told you, we're not going any further
until the general calls.

310
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:23,396
Tell me, Jamal, if you take your orders
from General Habib as I do,

311
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,869
how is it I've never heard of you or your cell?

312
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,315
- This is going south, Jack.
- Be patient.

313
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,834
Don't be a fool, Fayed.
You know how this works.

314
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:34,117
Every cell is autonomous,
without knowledge of the others.

315
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:38,318
It is the only way we can protect ourselves
and our operation if we get captured.

did you send them?"

<i>(speaks Arabic language)</i>

"Do you still have the bombs?"

They're with Halil at a safe house".

"Yes, General".

341
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,513
Are we good?

342
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:15,191
The safe house isn't far.
Head east toward the 110 freeway.

343
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,988
- The target vehicle is moving.
- Copy that, Jack.

344
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,833
Looks like it worked.
I'll let the White House know.

345
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,311
Let's go.

346
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,111
Mr President?

347
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,678
Hm?

348
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:53,230
- Are you feeling all right?
- I'm fine, Karen.

349
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:57,157
Just a... I'm just a little tired.

350
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,993
Mr President, I just got word from CTU.

351
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,753
The general's call
appears to have satisfied Fayed.

352
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:06,355
- He's leading them to the bombs.
- Oh, thank God.

353
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,591
I'm pleased we were able to help,
Mr President.

354
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:15,470
So am I. Karen, would you please
show the ambassador to his car?

355
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,788
Yes, Mr President.

356
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,270
Forgive me, Mr President.
I believe you asked me to remain here...

357
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,715
That won't be necessary any longer.

358
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:27,635
- Thank you again for your cooperation.
- Of course, Mr President.

359
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:35,195
- You handled him well, sir.
- The door, Tom.

360
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,953
- Excuse me, sir?
- The door... lock it.

361
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:40,952
- Mr President.
- No one can know.

362
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:43,031
Mr President!

363
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,840
Shadow teams for Bauer and Doyle
are standing by.

364
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:06,309
They'll advance
when Fayed is at the safe house.

365
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:09,631
No one moves until Jack confirms
that the nukes are there.

366
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:14,748
Make sure Fayed's vehicle and the follow car
have a wide berth - nothing to tip Fayed off.

367
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,558
Right.

368
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,790
- Sir, I think we have a problem.
- What?

369
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,668
The transcript between Habib and Fayed -
there's an inconsistency.

370
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:25,877
- The general spoke of a man named Sameer.
- That's right.

371
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:29,794
Sameer Al-Afted served on the general's staff
throughout the '90s.

372
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:33,270
He was implicated in money laundering
for radical organisations.

373
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,112
That's probably the guy.

374
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:40,035
The problem is, Sameer Al-Afted was killed
two years ago in a raid by Afghan forces.

375
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:43,590
But the general spoke about him
as if he were alive.

376
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:47,150
- He could be referring to another Sameer.
- Or it could be a code.

377
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:50,596
I think the general was telling Fayed
he was speaking under duress.

378
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,671
I'd better warn Jack and Doyle.

379
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:55,228
Nadia... good work.

380
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,355
Jack, they're turning north onto Adams.

381
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:05,434
We just detected what might be a duress code
in the conversation between Habib and Fayed.

382
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:09,991
- Give me the specifics.
- The general mentioned Sameer Al-Afted.

383
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:13,117
But Sameer's been dead for two years.

384
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,998
- I'll call Jamal.
- If they're wrong, you could blow this.

385
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:23,676
If they're right, this is already over.
Now, give me your phone!

386
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,191
<i>(phone rings)</i>

387
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,229

388

This is Agent Bauer.
I'm in the follow vehicle behind.

389
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:37,719
- I need you to listen very carefully.
- Go ahead.

390
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:41,190
We believe General Habib
may have given Fayed a distress signal.

391
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,874
Fayed might know that this is a setup.

392

Dammit! What the hell just happened?
CTU, we just lost video and audio.

395
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,793
They went into a tunnel.
It may just be interference.

<i>- How long is it?
- (Chloe) Checking.</i>

We've got a visual on the target vehicle.
It stopped in the tunnel. We're gonna engage.

Dead.

Jack, say again. We didn't get that.

No contact from Agent Doyle.
Aerial One says they're in the tunnel.

418
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,398
Send the call to audio forensics

Yes, sir.

421
00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:00,673
Bill, this is Doyle. I don't have a 20 on Jack,
but I have a dead body at the loading dock.

422
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:35,070

- His blood pressure's dropped to 80 over 40.

423
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:39,312
It could be any number of things -
vascular damage from the adrenaline shot,

424
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,879
intracranial swelling.

425
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,394
Mr President,
we have to get you down to Medical.

426
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:46,517
No. No, I'm not going anywhere.

427
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:53,269
Just give me another shot of adrenaline.

428
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:56,238
No, sir. Another injection would kill you.

429
00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:01,440
I should never have given you that last one.
I won't make that mistake again. I'm sorry.

430
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:11,869
- Sir, what are you doing?
- I'm going back to work.

431
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:14,474
Please listen to him.
Let him perform some tests.

- In my opinion, you won't last that long.
- I might surprise you.

434
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:29,471
Mr President, if you don't get down to
Medical now, you can have my resignation.

435
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:34,509
I won't accept your resignation,
Arthur, so don't bother.

Will you excuse us?

Tom... call CTU.

439
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,152

440
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,514
All right.

441
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,913
What's going on, Brother Fayed?
What happened?

442
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,470
Gredenko betrayed us.
He led CTU right to me.

443
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,677
- What?
- They may be tracking me. It's not safe here.

444
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,479
- Load the bombs onto the truck.
- Where are we going?

445
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:58,872
To finish this. We're going to take out
downtown Los Angeles.

446
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:03,033
Let's move. You wait here.
You guys, come with me.

447
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:12,270
<i>(shouting in Arabic language)</i>

448
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,115
Say hello to your brother.

449
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:29,799
<i>(helicopter approaches)</i>

450
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,631
Jack. Jack.

451
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,512
- You all right?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

452
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:52,509
- How did you find me?
- We tracked the sanitation truck by satellite.

453
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:56,832
- The bombs are on the table.
- CTU, this is Doyle. We're on site.

454
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,956
<i>(Buchanan) Go ahead, Mike.</i>

455
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:03,109
The bombs are secure and Jack's all right.

456
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,668
Repeat, the bombs are secure.

457
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,389
Damn, Jack.

458
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,550
Let's get you to Medical.

459
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:24,235
<i>- I'm fine.
- (phone rings)</i>

460
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,713
Doyle.

461
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:39,670
You've got a call. It's been routed
through the CTU switchboard.

462
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,751
Thanks.

463
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:45,838
This is Bauer.

464
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,798
Hello? Hello?

465
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,871
<i>(Audrey) Jack...</i>

466
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,871
<i>Are you there?</i>

467
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:56,637
- Can you hear me?
- Audrey?

468
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:02,116
Help me, Jack, please. Help me.

469
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:08,118
- What the hell is going on? Where are you?
- Hello, Mr Bauer. Yes, Ms Raines is alive.

470
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:15,311
If you wish her to remain that way, you will
call me back in ten minutes at 310-597-3781

471
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,391
on a secure line.

472
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:21,553
If you make any attempt
to find our location, she dies.

473
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:25,913
Cheng? Cheng?!

474
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:13,831
