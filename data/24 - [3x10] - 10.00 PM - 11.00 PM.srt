1
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,156
- Julia.
- Mr President.

2
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,754
David is wondering
why I want him to fire Wayne.

3
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,479
- Wayne and I became involved.
- They had an affair.

4
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,198
I think you'll agree, David,

5
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,352
you wouldn't be where you are
without my support over the years.

6
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:31,070
I've never asked you for anything in return,
but I'm asking you now.

7
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:34,277
- Fire Wayne.
- I'm sorry, Alan, I can't do that.

8
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:37,909
You know me well enough
not to be surprised by repercussions.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,437
Bauer's with the Salazar brothers in Mexico.
His transponder signal stopped working.

10
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,829
We're doing all we can to re-establish contact.

11
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,798
Tell the Delta units to hold their position.

12
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:51,111
- Do you know how to do a frequency scan?
- Yeah.

13
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,236
We want to pick up
your father's transponder signal.

14
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,959
Michelle's begun it. Coordinate with her.

15
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,553
I have a message from Jack.

16
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:01,428
The virus they're going to buy,
Jack is going to take it from them.

17
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,115
Jack promised to get me and my family
out of here if I help you.

18
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,679
Then help me.

19
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:10,150
There's been a complication.
Another buyer's interested in the virus.

20
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,038
We'll auction the virus to the highest bidder.

21
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:16,237
Your bid is 225 million dollars.

22
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,189
Hers is 240. Nina, you win.

23
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,511
You're of no use to us any more! You failed!

24
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,238
Ramón, don't do this.

25
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,711
Five hours ago you were in prison.
Now you're free because I broke you out!

26
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,074
We can get the virus.

27
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,469
- How do you get the virus?
- The woman, Nina.

28
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,790
If I fail, you get to kill me. Fine.

29
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:41,431
But if I succeed, the deal will go forward.
We'll be back on track. We'll all get paid!

30
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,711
How many more are coming, huh?

31
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,228
<i>Are they Americanos or federales or both?</i>

32
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,629
- So where are we on this?
- Jack's last known position is here.

33
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,950
NSA says they can reposition a satellite.

34
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,430
- But it'll take two orbits to get over the area.
- That'll be too late.

35
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:52,035
Sporadic satellite coverage is probably
why they chose that place to meet.

36
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,354
- It's Hector.
- Thread it through our system.

37
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,796
Trace this on all the networks.
You'll need an explanation.

38
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,235
They haven't heard from you
in over two hours.

39
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,151
We're set.

40
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:10,956
Ortega.

41
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,713
<i> What's going on?
I've been trying to reach you.</i>

42
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,314
I was at Division with the bureau chief.

43
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,756
- Is there a problem?
- No, I'm back at CTU now.

44
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,353
Nobody suspects you?

45
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,318
If they did, we wouldn't be
having this conversation.

46
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,437
All right, listen, we have a problem.

47
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:30,990
The seller double-crossed us.
He brought in a second bidder.

48
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,833
Some woman name Nina Myers.

49
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,716
Amador held an auction. We lost.

50
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,109
- So you don't have the virus?
- No.

51
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,237
- What do you want me to do?
- Bauer knows this woman, Nina.

52
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:46,153
We're going to try to
get it through her. Hold on.

53
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,757
- Gael, it's Jack.
- Jack.

54
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,231
<i>I'll give you a cellphone number that
Amador's been using for the last few hours.</i>

55
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,072
Ping it until you get his location.

56
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:03,589
The number's 011-5255-3224-0135.

57
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,392
- Got it. Hey, are you all right?
- Yeah.

58
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,870
Get back to me on this number
when you've got his location.

59
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,674
One more thing.
Bauer's partner showed up.

60
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,228
- You have him?
- Yes, we have him.

61
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,959
<i>-  Alive?
-  Yes, for now.</i>

62
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,350
Is he working alone, or does he have backup?

63
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,796
Edmunds is in Field Ops.
I don't have access to their mandate.

64
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,872
You get access, OK?
What are we paying you for?

65
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,112
If I try, it might blow my cover.
Best to keep Edmunds alive until we find out.

66
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,078
All right. Track Amador.

67
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,869
- Do you have a location on Jack?
- Here.

68
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,155
Four miles from our last contact point.

69
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,596
Tell the Delta units to adjust their positions
and wait for orders.

70
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,194
Run a passive triangulation
on Amador's phone.

71
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:03,036
Kim. We found your father.

72
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,032
He's undercover with the Salazars. He's fine.

73
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,510
Thank God.
What about Chase?

74
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,909
He's been captured.

75
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,037
- Captured? Is he OK?
- He's alive. They're holding him.

76
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:20,558
- What do you mean, holding him?
- My guess is they're interrogating him.

77
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,996
Once we get the virus, we'll go in for Chase.

78
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,997
- Thanks for not keeping this from me.
- Sure.

79
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,478
- Do you need anything else?
- No. Just making sure you're OK.

80
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,551
I'm fine. Thank you.

81
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,437
- Did you tell her?
- About Chase.

82
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,670
- But not about Nina?
- No.

83
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:54,036
She doesn't need to know about that now.

84
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,350
Jack, how long will it take
to trace Amador's phone?

85
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,954
If everything goes right, ten minutes.

86
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,634
I'll call our clients, tell them there's a delay.

87
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,632
I'll see if they're getting
anywhere with his partner.

88
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,233
<i> Let's go.</i>

89
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,472
- Hector!
- Sergio, what are you doing here?

90
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,714
My sister says we're going. She's taking
me and my father away from here.

91
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,951
- Did she say when?
- Soon.

92
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:48,114
- But I don't wanna leave you, Hector.
- I would never let that happen.

93
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:53,479
OK now, you go back to bed, but don't
tell your sister anything about this, OK?

94
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,552
And I'll make sure everything works out.

95
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:02,237
- You'll talk to her?
- Yes. I'll talk to her, OK? Come on.

96
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,751
- How is Chase?
- Holding on.

97
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,910
I'm going with Ramón to pick up the virus.

98
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,150
If you get a chance to get out of here, take it.

99
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,677
Get Chase, tell him to call CTU.
They can get in touch with the rescue units.

100
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,228
He'll get you and your family out of here.

101
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,352
- Planning on going somewhere?
- What do you mean?

102
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,477
<i>- Don't play games with me.
- Don't play games with me.</i>

103
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,554
- What are you talking about?
- Sergio was packing a bag to go away.

104
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:00,552
- What's so funny?
- He was being bad.

105
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,551
Something he picked up from you.

106
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:07,589
I told him I was taking him away from here.
I was trying to keep him in line.

107
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,229
That's all? Just trying to keep him in line?

108
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,834
He said he wanted a gun like yours.

109
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:18,072
I said no. He got nasty,
so I scared some sense into him.

110
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,669
He's a good boy.
Don't scare him like that.

111
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,320
Don't encourage him to play with guns.

112
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,912
<i> Jack.</i>

113
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,956
<i>- Yeah.
-  Let's go.</i>

114
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,390
Adam says we're back in touch with Jack.

115
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:14,074
- We just heard from him.
- How close are we to the virus?

116
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,470
We have the phone number
of the seller, a Michael Amador.

117
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,551
We're running a passive triangulation.

118
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:23,394
- Then what?
- We pass the location of Amador onto Jack

119
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,516
and let Jack call the shots.

120
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,832
- I'll bring Division up to speed.
- Ryan, there's one more thing.

121
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,480
We found out there's
another player in the deal.

122
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,313
- Who is it?
- Nina Myers.

123
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:41,271
I thought we had her restricted to North Africa
after the president gave her exiled immunity.

124
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,353
We did. Apparently she slipped out.

125
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,312
- Jack's trying to get her to help him.
- Help him?

126
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:53,518
- She killed his wife, that's a hard sell.
- I don't know the details.

127
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:58,116
- Does Kim know about it?
- No. I'd like to keep it that way for now.

128
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,195
All right, keep me updated.

129
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,713
- I owe you an apology.
- You don't.

130
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,756
If you thought I wasn't fit to do my job,
then you had a duty to report it.

131
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:38,719
But I wouldn't risk the effectiveness
of this unit to prove how tough I am.

132
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,236
- I know that. I just felt...
- I know what you felt!

133
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,470
You made that perfectly clear.

134
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,553
<i>- Yeah.
-  We need Michelle downstairs.</i>

135
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,835
Yeah, all right.

136
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,991
What? What do you mean, you have to go?

137
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,355
Sarah, this is a crisis. I can't leave.

138
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:20,752
<i>- I'm sorry. I have other responsibilities.
- Well, where are you now?</i>

139
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:25,277
Oh, for God's sake.
All right, OK.

140
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:39,395
- He's very stubborn, Hector.
- Move.

141
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,957
CTU doesn't have
your travel plans in their records.

142
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:03,510
Did you come down here by yourself?

143
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,592
Tell me, this will be all over.

144
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:10,070
Did you come down here by yourself?

145
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,912
Keep at it.
If he doesn't crack soon, use gasoline.

146
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,468
<i>Si, patron.</i>

147
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,992
Are all agencies up to speed?

148
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:53,789
- They're coordinating with the military.
- And the Mexican government?

149
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,440
Full cooperation.
They've given us a free hand.

150
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:59,876
Mr President, may I please have a word?

151
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,951
- Thank you, Gerry.
- Sir.

152
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,834
Thanks, Gerry.

153
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,039
I just got off the phone with Sullivan.
He's pulling his vote.

154
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:14,159
- How many senators have we lost?
- Three, all protégés of Milliken's.

155
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,199
Unless Milliken calls off his dogs,
we're not gonna get Health Care passed.

156
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,874
He's sabotaging a bill
that could benefit millions.

157
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:25,158
He's showing you that he had the power
to help start your political career,

158
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,276
but he also has the power to end it.

159
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,559
<i>You can't lose this debate and fail to pass</i>

160
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,029
the most important
legislation of your presidency.

161
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,430
- We'd hand Keeler the election.
- We haven't lost the senate vote.

162
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,159
We will.

163
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:45,233
Unless you give in
to his demands and fire me, we will.

164
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:54,033
- David, you don't have a choice here.
- I told you before, that's not an option.

165
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,111
Listen, I...

166
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:00,956
I know you wanna do the right thing by me.

167
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,715
But I'm the one who made this mistake.

168
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:09,157
My affair with Milliken's wife
was stupid and wrong...

169
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:13,153
Yes, it was.
But what he's trying to do is worse.

170
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:17,392
For revenge, he'll kill a piece of legislation
that's good for this country.

171
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:20,597
We can't let that happen.

172
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,955
There has to be a way to get to him.

173
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,918
<i>Yes.</i>

174
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,515
<i> I have Senator Haynes for you, sir.</i>

175
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,719
<i>- Senator.
- Mr President.</i>

176
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,950
Push them off the stacks.
I'll be back soon.

177
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,713
<i>- The card files?
- No, just what I said.</i>

178
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,109
Learn to follow instructions, Justin.

179
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:52,958
- I have every right to be angry.
- I'm sorry, but it's a family emergency.

180
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,749
There are two family emergencies
now, aren't there?

181
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:59,070
Hi, baby girl.

182
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:02,074
Of the two, yours is less important.

183
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,391
- Not to me, it's not.
- Your job is in serious jeopardy.

184
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,471
Whatever.

185
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,877
What did you learn from Edmunds?

186
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:19,192
He can take a bullet through the hand
without saying anything useful.

187
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,439
- Gael?
- Yeah, we're tracking Amador.

188
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:32,559
He's seven miles north of Palo Verde,
moving west on a rural highway.

189
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,392
- Any idea where he's going?
- No.

190
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,869
Just get back to me as soon as he's stopped.

191
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:41,954
They've located Amador on a highway seven
miles north of Palo Verde, moving west.

192
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:46,238
- Highway 14. We can't let him get too far.
- OK. Get everyone ready.

193
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,790
No. You can't ambush Amador
unless you're certain he's got the virus.

194
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:53,555
- What are you saying we do?
- Let him lead us to Nina.

195
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,995
When we're sure
they have the virus, we go in.

196
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,152
But not with an army of men.
You have to let me go alone.

197
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:02,630
You're not going anywhere alone.
I'm not letting you out of my sight.

198
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,188
We go together.
Hector, you're better off here.

199
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:11,674
And make sure that everyone's ready,
just in case. Jack, give me the phone.

200
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,751
You're driving.

201
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,074
You still not asleep?

202
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,072
It's OK, Sergio.

203
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,395
Papa.

204
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:35,359
- What do they want with that man?
- I don't know, but at least he's still alive.

205
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,830
Get ready, we're leaving.
Hector's resting. This is our chance.

206
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,434
- No, we can't...
- Don't argue. I need your help.

207
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,717
- What can I do?
- Make sure the trucks can't follow us.

208
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:48,236
Pull wires, whatever.
Then get Sergio ready and keep him quiet.

209
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,675
- Put him in the truck and wait.
- What will you do?

210
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:53,752
- What I have to. Now go.
- Be careful.

211
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:17,828
- Emilio, do you have a light?
- Sure.

212
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:12,117
Julia. It's been a long time.

213
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,997
Hi.

214
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,592
Thanks for meeting me.

215
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:24,356
My husband's trying
to force the president to fire you.

216
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:27,876
There's much more at stake here
than just my job, you know.

217
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:32,715
It's about my brother being able to run
his administration the way that he sees fit.

218
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:37,794
It's not fair to the people of this country
for the president to be extorted.

219
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,713
- I do love it when you get all noble.
- Julia...

220
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,075
What am I supposed to do?

221
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:46,755
- All of this is out of my control.
- No, it's not.

222
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,796
It's not, and I think you know that.

223
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,669
Everybody thinks Alan dominates you.

224
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,876
The truth is, he needs you.
You know that.

225
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,750
Say you'll leave him if he doesn't back off.

226
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:04,833
- He'd never believe me.
- Make him believe you.

227
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,238
I miss you.

228
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,671
Do you miss me?

229
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:23,714
- Oh, what difference would it make?
- It could make a lot of difference.

230
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,189
Julia, stop it. We can't.

231
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:39,758
- Do you think of me?
- Don't do this.

232
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,912
It's a simple question.
Do you think about me?

233
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:51,191
Yes. Yes, I think about you.

234
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,554
- But it doesn't mean anything.
- I think about you.

235
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:01,839
- And it does mean something.
- I didn't come here for this.

236
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:05,196
You came here because
you wanted something.

237
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:09,956
I want something, too.
I like being Mrs Alan Milliken.

238
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:18,068
But that does not have to have
anything to do with you and me.

239
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,595
Come back to me.

240
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,914
That's what I want in return.

241
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:34,313
It worked once, it can work again.

242
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:44,113
It never worked. Not for me.

243
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,635
Then I'm afraid I can't help you.

244
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,395
Talk to me, you bastard!

245
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,192
<i>- No! 
- What you don't understand...</i>

246
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:16,671
What you don't understand is if you don't talk,
Hector will take it out on me.

247
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:20,548
<i>- Talk to me!
-  Eduardo, back off!</i>

248
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,237
Hector thinks he might talk to me.

249
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:37,354
Tell these men what they want to know
and your suffering will end.

250
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:42,116
- You won't be killed, I swear.
- Why should I believe you?

251
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,510
Because if you don't, they'll burn you alive.

252
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:50,432
- He's a stubborn one, isn't he?
- We can handle him.

253
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,834
Check his pockets.
He's got a phone.

254
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:08,235
There's a gun on the table.

255
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:24,913
- What are you doing?
- I've got to stop the bleeding or I could die.

256
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:46,596
- Come on, we have to go.
- Give me the gun.

257
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,150
- Stay down, Sergio.
- What's going on?

258
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,231
Everything's gonna be fine.

259
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,875
Come on, come on. Let's go.

260
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,988
Hurry, hurry.
Get down, get down.

261
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:23,112
- Where are you going?
- Hector wants me to pick up something.

262
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,714
- What?
- It's none of your business.

263
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:54,108
- Papa, what's happening?
- It's OK. Stay down.

264
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,591
Claudia!

265
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:32,518
Thank you. Thank you.

266
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,635
Chloe.

267
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,595
- Are Delta teams in position yet?
- Yes, they're in the area.

268
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,671
Soon as we say, they'll pick up Chase.

269
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:32,196
Make sure everyone knows this is
subordinate to obtaining the virus.

270
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,350
- It's in the brief.
- Once we have Chase,

271
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:37,637
link in Division, District
and the Attorney General's office.

272
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:40,280
A lot of people want answers from him.

273
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,475
- What was that?
- Nothing.

274
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,275
- Is this your child?
- Yes.

275
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:03,069
She hasn't been interfering with work.
Technically there's no rule...

276
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,754
There's no rule because it's common sense.

277
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,956
- Now get rid of it.
- If I could, I would.

278
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:11,237
My baby-sitter hit me with some
very unprofessional behavior.

279
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:16,838
I want the baby out of here, Chloe. Now.
Or find someone else to do your job.

280
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:20,196
Parents are a protected group,
Mr Chappelle. This is not fair.

281
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:36,796
Amador's stopped about 200 yards up
a dirt road that intersects with Highway 14

282
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,599
about two miles west of Rancho Guadalupe.

283
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:42,672
OK, good work. We'll find it.

284
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:46,070
- Amador stopped half a mile up the road.
- What do we do?

285
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:50,790
Nina is either with him now, or she will be
any minute. We need to isolate her.

286
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:14,353
Let me see the night scope.

287
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:22,599
One... two... three.

288
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,396
- OK, I'm ready to go in.
- I told you.

289
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:30,075
- I'm not letting you out of my sight.
- Ramón, I am trained to do this.

290
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:35,393
If I go in myself, I might succeed.
If we go in together, both of us will get killed.

291
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,152
- How long?
- As long as it takes.

292
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,993
You'll have to trust me.
I want this money as bad as you.

293
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:45,712
- I'll trust you when we have the virus.
- I promise, I can make her work with us.

294
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:50,430
Use the night scope. As soon as I've entered
the building safely, go back to the main road.

295
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:54,798
If Amador mobilizes his resources outside
this perimeter, we've got to be ready.

296
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,313
OK?

297
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,511
All right, go.

298
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:08,717
<i> The funds are ready to transfer.
When do I get the virus?</i>

299
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,314
I'll call you with the location in half an hour.

300
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:14,472
You'll transfer
50% of the funds then, as agreed.

301
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,915
I don't like jumping through all these hoops.

302
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,551
The hoops are here to protect us, Nina.
Just wait here for my call.

303
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,516
<i> Freeze.</i>

304
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,239
Just take it easy.
Take it easy, I'm unarmed.

305
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:49,756
The Salazars wanted me to set up
a meeting with your employer.

306
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,398
Nina!

307
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,236
Nina, don't move.

308
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,353
Drop the gun.

309
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,390
Get back in the church.

310
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,711
Take a seat.

311
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:49,912
Don't worry, if I wanted to kill you,
you'd be dead by now.

312
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,072
<i>Put the briefcase down.</i>

313
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:21,914
- Tony, it's Chase. He just called in.
- All right, source the call.

314
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,796
<i>- Where are you?
- Our truck broke down.</i>

315
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:29,431
We're 15 miles east of the Salazars' camp.
You should be able to lock onto this cell.

316
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:33,593
We've got Delta teams in the area.
We'll send a chopper. What about Jack?

317
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:36,069
He went with Ramón
to find Amador and the virus.

318
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:39,072
- How long ago?
- About half an hour.

319
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:44,359
Tell them I'm bringing out two people and the
body of the woman who helped me escape.

320
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:47,591
- Who was she?
- Claudia. Hector's girlfriend.

321
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:51,195
- I've got her father and her brother.
- A Delta team is ten minutes away.

322
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:54,192
- Can you hang tight for ten?
- I don't know, just get 'em here.

323
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:57,317
<i>- Sit tight, they're on their way.
- Can you tell Kim that...</i>

324
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,271
- Tell her I'll call her when I'm safe.
- Yeah, you got it.

325
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:08,748
<i> Claudia.</i>

326
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,756
Jack, if you didn't come here to kill me,
why are you here?

327
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:40,832
- I need to talk to you alone.
- That's not gonna happen.

328
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:49,355
- How much is your buyer paying you?
- Two million, once I deliver the virus.

329
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,908
The Salazars will pay you a lot more.

330
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,551
- How much more?
- What is this?

331
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:57,279
- Shut up.
- This guy shouldn't be breathing.

332
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:00,875
I'm handling it.
How much more, Jack?

333
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,555
At least ten times more than
what you're getting paid now.

334
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,870
Really?

335
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:10,154
That's a pretty great deal.

336
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:15,598
What if my buyer doesn't get his virus?
He's gonna hunt me down and kill me.

337
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:19,150
With that kind of money you could
disappear and never be found.

338
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:22,038
Yeah, and what about you?

339
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:27,148
The Salazars are paying me enough money
to do what I want for the rest of my life.

340
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:32,473
I don't believe you, Jack.
I think you're still working for CTU.

341
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:37,031
- Well, you're wrong.
- You're not the type of guy to sell out.

342
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:42,473
- You'd do anything for your country.
- There was a time when that was true.

343
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,757
But what did it ever get me?
I lost everything.

344
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:49,879
When I went undercover with the Salazars,
I had to give them my soul.

345
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:54,875
When I brought Ramón Salazar in,
what was waiting for me? No one, nothing!

346
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,674
What about Kim?

347
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:06,631
She never forgave me for
what happened to her mother.

348
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:12,758
I want to give her most of the money,
help get through what's happened.

349
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:16,355
OK, so... say you are working alone.

350
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:22,434
I killed your wife. What's gonna keep you
from killing me the first chance you get?

351
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,556
I don't have a choice.

352
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:30,234
I broke Ramón Salazar out of an American
prison. I can never go back there again.

353
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:33,073
This is my one shot at a big score.

354
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,637
After that, I swear to you,
I just wanna disappear.

355
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:45,633
We've wasted enough time, Nina.
You kill him, or I'm calling in.

356
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,311
Fair enough.

357
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,519
What are you up to, Jack?

358
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:43,790
- I went to see Julia.
- What?

359
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,870
To see if she would help us with Alan.

360
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:59,114
- And?
- She said no.

361
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:05,312
Listen, I've been thinking, and you
don't have an alternative here, David.

362
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:10,194
This is my mess, I'll take the heat.
Let me resign.

363
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:13,033
I may ask you to when this is over.

364
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:17,591
But it won't be because
Milliken is forcing my hand.

365
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:24,678
Wayne, I've been doing some thinking too.
And there is an alternative.

366
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:29,675
If Milliken wants to play dirty,
we'll have to lower ourselves to his level.

367
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,830
By doing what?

368
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:37,390
Give me a moment.

369
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:16,754
<i>- Hello?
- Sherry?</i>

370
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,831
David.

371
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:22,429
David, what's wrong?

372
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:26,638
- I need your help.
- All right, I'm listening.

373
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,915
I'm downtown.
I need to see you tonight.

374
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:33,195
- Tell me more.
- I can't say much over the phone.

375
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,872
It's about Alan Milliken.

376
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,960
<i>- Fine.
- I'll send a car.</i>

377
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,630
You really did break Salazar out of prison.

378
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,188
I'm not the man you knew before.

379
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,072
Well, I don't know about that.

380
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:30,793
But 20 million dollars...
I'm gonna keep me an open mind.

381
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:40,599
So, Jack, if we're gonna go forward
with this, I have to know one thing.

382
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:45,395
Are you gonna be able
to forgive me for killing Teri?

383
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:49,951
If I wanted revenge, Nina, I would have
killed you already. You know that.

384
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:59,915
It's like I said, all I wanna do is finish
this deal and disappear for good.

385
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,511
Convince me.
