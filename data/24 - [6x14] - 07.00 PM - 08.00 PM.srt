1
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:17,119
Abu Fayed, a citizen of your country,
enters the United States,

2
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,998
detonates a nuclear bomb, killing thousands.

3
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,436
Next, Assad attempts to
assassinate the president.

4
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:27,399
You know we have cooperated with you
since the inception of this crisis.

5
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,109
- I had an understanding with your president.
- Now have one with me.

6
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,590
You help us find those nukes
before another goes off,

7
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,752
or I'm gonna unleash
our military on your country.

8
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:42,473
<i>- I'm terminating the American. Confirm?
- Yes.</i>

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,348
<i>- The American shot Vasili in the basement.
- Shut down the phone lines, DSL, everything.</i>

10
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:58,790
<i>- Morris, I know how to find Gredenko.
- (static on phone line)</i>

11
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,472
- Morris?
- Jack?

12
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,755
Jack?

13
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,513
Jack Bauer is being held
in the Russian consulate.

14
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:10,230
Doyle will help you put a tactical profile
together for an assault on the consulate.

15
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,350
Our primary objective
is to abduct Anatoly Markov, the consul.

16
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:19,594
Markov knows how to find Gredenko, who
controls the remaining three suitcase nukes.

17
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,396
- The Americans are coming.
- I thought you had that under control.

18
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:28,235
- They'll soon have your position.
- The drone is ready to launch. Arm the bomb.

19
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:34,277
- What's going on at the Russian consulate?
- Jack is somewhere inside. We have to go in.

20
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,112
Drop your weapon!

21
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,473
My name is Jack Bauer.
You need to contact Buchanan.

22
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,074
Fayed and Gredenko
are in the Shadow Valley.

23
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,549
Patch me in with Buchanan.

24
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,630
- Medevac's on the way. How are you?
- I'm fine.

25
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:27,316
He may have rib fragments which can cause
internal bleeding. He needs to be stabilised.

26
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,275
I'm fine. I wanna be involved in this.

27
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,875
CTU has the ball, Jack.
Right now, this is out of your hands.

28
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:46,437
We believe Gredenko has at least five RQ-2
aerial drones somewhere in Shadow Valley.

29
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,714
RQ-2s?

30
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,509
Unmanned aircraft which can be
remotely piloted from anywhere.

31
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,990
He's arming them with the nuclear weapons
he provided to Fayed?

32
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,595
Yes, sir. We're redirecting
satellite coverage over the desert.

33
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,875
The air force is scrambling F-16s.

34
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:04,669
But you have no idea how close they are
to launching these drones?

35
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,069
No, sir, we don't.

36
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:10,550
<i>- All right, Bill. Keep me updated.
- Yes, sir.</i>

37
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:20,074
- Bring the trucks around. We are moving out.
- What's wrong?

38
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,310
How many drones have been armed?

39
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,391
- Just this one.
- Dammit!

40
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,234
We need to launch it now. Get it ready.

41
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:31,756
- Go, go.
- Tell me what's wrong.

42
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,870
- What's wrong?
- The Americans know our location.

43
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,269
How?

44
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,875
It was Markov, huh? Markov told them.

45
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:48,592
All that matters is they know we are here. We
need to launch the drone before they close in.

46
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,069
We have three bombs and three targets.

47
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,835
We'll find a way
to deliver the other two bombs.

48
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,752
All this time,
we've tolerated your condescension,

49
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,229
berating us for losing the other bombs.

50
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:05,517
But now it's your fault. Markov was your man.

51
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:09,559
Blame me all you want,
but if we stay here we'll be captured or killed.

52
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,036
Refit the bombs into their casings
and load them on the truck.

53
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,714
Do it now! Take them out!

54
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,757
- We're accelerating our schedule.
- Why?

55
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:30,153
I don't have time to explain.
I need you to launch drone 0709.

56
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,277
I haven't finished implementing
the evasion vectors.

57
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,433
- They'll shoot it before it reaches its target.
- Launch the drone.

58
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,557
You'll execute evasion tactics
once it's in the air.

59
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,596
Yes, sir.

60
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,033
We need to leave now.

61
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,550
Come on, let's go.

62
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,356
We're repositioning our satellites, sir.

63
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,671
As soon as we make visual contact,
we'll uplink a feed to you.

64
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,718
<i>(man) Just get me that intel, Yassir.
Lives are at stake.</i>

65
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,677
Yes, sir.

66
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,039
Are you OK?

67
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,839
The truth? No, not really.

68
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,995
We're gonna get through this, OK?

69
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,309
I hope so.

70
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,073
- Is there a problem, Chloe?
- Yeah.

71
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,556
Are you gonna tell us what it is?

72
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:03,758
I was installing upgrades and I noticed
you were using Milo's clearance code,

73
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,877
which, if you didn't know,
is a felony security breach.

74
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,474
No, my system's been glitchy and I think I...

75
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:14,793
It's not a glitch. She's been working with your
ID, so unless she stole it, you gave it to her.

76
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,350
Milo was just trying to help me do my work.

77
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,591
Homeland Security sent down an order
restricting my access

78
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,513
because I was born in the Middle East.

79
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,309
I've heard of that directive.
It's wrong to racially profile our agents,

80
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,358
but it's still a felony
for you to be using Milo's code.

81
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,759
Chloe,

82
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,070
look, we...

83
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,995
If you report this...

84
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,436
We can't help the situation
if we're fired and arrested.

85
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,398
If I wanted to report you,
I wouldn't be talking to you.

86
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,836
I'm telling you this so that you'll be careful.

87
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:53,153
I mean, I noticed it. Someone else
is gonna notice it sooner or later.

88
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,151
<i>(phone rings)</i>

89
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,435
<i>- (Buchanan) Nadia?
- Yes, sir?</i>

90
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,318
Morris has a satellite visual
on Shadow Valley.

91
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,960
It looks like they've launched a single drone.

92
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:07,157
- I'm conferencing with General Walsh.
- I'll be there, sir.

93
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:10,437
Coordinate with first responders
in all target zones.

94
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,111
<i>- Put General Walsh through.
- (woman) Sir, Bill Buchanan.</i>

95
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:18,478
<i>- This is Walsh.
- (Buchanan) We have contact with a drone.</i>

96
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,155
- We're tracking it.
- It's heading northwest out of Shadow Valley.

97
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,313
Altitude is 3300 feet and climbing.
Velocity is 360 miles an hour.

98
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,834
I'm looking at the specs on the RQ-2 now.

99
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:32,879
It's got a low-profile design,
virtually impossible to detect by radar.

100
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,599
We'll need to
manually guide F-16s to intercept.

101
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,912
- We're uplinking a video feed now.
- Have you determined its intended target?

102
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,152
Yes. The closest target is downtown
Los Angeles. That's a four-minute window.

103
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,199
Maximum airspeed of an RQ-2
is 400 miles per hour.

104
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:53,277
My F-16s should be able to intercept it
within two minutes.

105
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:58,674
That may be a problem. I can't find the drone.

106
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,430
- The drone's gone.
- How can it be gone?

107
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,956
- It was passing between grids, but...
- Use projected vectors.

108
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,554
I am. It's just not where it's supposed to be.

109
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:14,350
Until you find it,
I'll have my F-16s stay in a holding pattern.

110
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,118
<i>(phone rings)</i>

111
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:23,077
- Yes?
- I've accessed our connection to CTU.

112
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,799
<i>I've disabled their tracking capability.</i>

113
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,348
Then they cannot detect the drone?

114
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:33,309
No, and I'll be able to keep it hidden
from their satellites until we've hit the target.

115
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:38,952
Good. I'll contact you again
once we are out of the area.

116
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:45,679
Sir, I was talking to Bill Buchanan.
They were tracking one of the drones.

117
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,992
- They've now lost visual contact with it.
- Lost visual contact?

118
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,470
It's unclearjust how, sir.
They just simply can't find it.

119
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:57,553
We have the most sophisticated
satellite network. How did this happen?

120
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,996
- CTU is still determining that, sir.
- What about the military?

121
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:05,119
They've got squadrons looking,
but these drones are invisible to radar

122
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:10,991
so the pilots are limited to making visual ID
at night over hundreds of square miles.

123
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:16,438
CTU has a ranked list of potential targets.
They're running civil disaster scenarios.

124
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,795
- Lisa?
- Sir.

125
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,440
Advance the meeting with the Joint Chiefs.

126
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:24,193
- When do you want it to happen?
- Right away.

127
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:27,352
Wait, sir, why are we assembling
the Joint Chiefs?

128
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,318
I warned the ambassador, Tom.

129
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:33,710
You heard me tell him
that I'd hold his country responsible

130
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,360
if another weapon was detonated on our soil.

131
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:39,273
Sir, there is absolutely no evidence

132
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,638
that his country either sponsored
these attacks or is even in support of them.

133
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:48,157
His people need to understand
that I'm notjust rattling my sabre.

134
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,119
They need to see with their own eyes
that I will answer this threat

135
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,192
with an in-kind military response.

136
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,310
Wait. "In kind", sir?

137
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:06,077
I want the Joint Chiefs to draw up
our own target list for a nuclear strike.

138
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:17,713
I won't let another attack
go unanswered, Tom.

139
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:38,032
At its speed, the drone should've reached
LA, so we can eliminate us as a target.

140
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:41,032
Soon I can take Santa Barbara
and San Diego off the list.

141
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,190
How many targets does that leave?

142
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:47,478
Counting cities
with populations over a million, 15.

143
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,551
We have to narrow it down.

144
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:54,316
Assuming they want the maximum civilian
death toll, how many likely targets in range?

145
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:59,030
Areas with the highest population density
are San Francisco, Las Vegas and Phoenix.

146
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,795
Confirm that first responders
have deployed in those cities.

147
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,509
Make sure the air force
prioritises their search on that basis.

148
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,953
<i>(Morris) Yup.</i>

149
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,759
Give me the projected coordinates.

150
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,789
Bill. Bill, did we pick up Gredenko?

151
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,236
- We're working on it.
- Bill, what happened?

152
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,790
Gredenko escaped,
but not before launching one of the drones.

153
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:30,271
- How close is the air force to intercepting it?
- Minutes away when it disappeared.

154
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,874
We're still looking for it.

155
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,838
Jack, get to Medical.
There's nothing you can do here.

156
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,196
- Just keep me informed, please.
- I will.

157
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,556
I want you to run point
on the search for Fayed and Gredenko.

158
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,518
Milo's in the situation room. I'll be right there.

159
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:56,996
- I'll see you over at Medical.
- Yes, sir.

160
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,992
<i>- Hey. Can we have a moment, please?
- (woman) Certainly.</i>

161
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:04,073
- They said you were hurt.
- I'm not. I'm fine.

162
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:13,400
As soon as all of this is over,
I'll come by and check on you and Josh.

163
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:18,552
I always regretted
things didn't work out between us,

164
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,392
and...

165
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,358
I always believed you did too.

166
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,800
Maybe I was wrong.

167
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,758
No, you weren't.

168
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:42,153
Listen, Marilyn,
before I was taken prisoner by the Chinese,

169
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,231
I was with someone.

170
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,596
She doesn't even know I'm still alive.

171
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,274
I need to talk to her,

172
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:53,079
see what happens.

173
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:56,835
Are you talking about Audrey Raines?

174
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,194
Yeah.

175
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:03,359
You don't know, do you?

176
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,078
Jack, I'm...

177
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:09,308
I'm sorry to be the one
to have to tell you this.

178
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,675
Audrey's dead.

179
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,719
I don't know the details, just what I read
in the paper about her accident.

180
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:19,270
- What accident? When?
- It was a few months ago.

181
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,830
It was a car accident, somewhere in China.

182
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,835
China?

183
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,191
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

184
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,271
I have to go.

185
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:43,879
<i>(Chloe) There'll be channels open
for first responders in at-risk cities.</i>

186
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,713
All first responders should coordinate...

187
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,759
Why the hell didn't anybody
tell me about Audrey?

188
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:55,868
Mr Buchanan didn't wanna tell you because
we all thought Fayed was going to kill you,

189
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,599
but I probably should have.

190
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,672
- I'm sorry.
- She was in China looking for me?

191
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,513
She was the one who figured out
the Chinese had you.

192
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:08,718
Apparently, she spent the past year
going through back channels to get you out.

193
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,110
The rest of it's classified by Division.
I don't know any more.

194
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:18,070
We were asked to send DNA records so they
could ID the remains, which I guess they did.

195
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,594
I want that file.

196
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,830
- All right, Jack.
- Now!

197
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,909
- I have to dig it up in the archives.
- Just do it.

198
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:40,477
The secretary of defense
and the chairman will be attending.

199
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:45,714
The State will monitor via satellite and
the cabinet will be provided with transcripts.

200
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:49,918
You should also know
that Karen Hayes will be attending.

201
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,356
I thought I told you
I wanted her excluded from this.

202
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,558
She supported Wayne Palmer's policy
of appeasement. She's gonna be a problem.

203
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:01,713
There was nothing I could do.
She's still acting National Security Advisor.

204
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,950
But I believe, given the circumstances,

205
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:08,556
any objection to your plans
will not be able to gain traction.

206
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,996
Well, I've known Karen Hayes for many years.

207
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:16,119
It's always been a mistake
to underestimate... her.

208
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:24,877
Hello, Tom. Did somebody
push you down the stairs?

209
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:30,034
No, Karen. I tripped over your ineptitude.
On that subject, welcome back.

210
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,680
Look, Tom, I don't wanna play games.

211
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,797
I won't let you blackmail me again,
so do what you need to.

212
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:39,668
I am here to represent the president
and I intend to stay, all right?

213
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,830
Fair enough.

214
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:46,232
Karen? No one is sorrier than I am
about what happened to Wayne.

215
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:51,398
Well, at least we have that in common.

216
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,071
<i>(man) Karen.</i>

217
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,030
Please be seated.

218
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:17,676
As many of you are aware, the terrorist
who attacked us this morning, Abu Fayed,

219
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,149
with the help of Dmitri Gredenko,

220
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:26,759
has launched an aerial drone that we believe
is armed with another nuclear bomb.

221
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:32,195
Efforts are ongoing to locate this drone,
but should those efforts fail,

222
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:36,239
we're looking at a second attack
on our country in less than ten hours.

223
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:40,279
I am determined not to let this attack happen

224
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:43,238
without a military response on our part.

225
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:47,313
A military response
directed against whom, Mr Vice President?

226
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:50,517
We were under the impression
the terrorists were stateless.

227
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,990
Secretary Kanin,
that is the fiction they hide behind,

228
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:58,790
but everyone in this room knows
that elements within Abu Fayed's country

229
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,599
train and fund terrorist organisations like his.

230
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,275
It is time to hold them accountable.

231
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:10,388
The ambassador's just been informed that if
the nuclear weapon on that drone detonates,

232
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,756
we will retaliate with our own nuclear strike.

233
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:17,435
Now, this will be a warning shot,
not a full-scale attack.

234
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:22,753
The Joint Chiefs have been instructed
to identify an unpopulated area

235
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:26,913
where there will be
limited civilian casualties. Admiral?

236
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,710
The closest match we have to that scenario
is a territory near their northern border.

237
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,678
This should result in fewer than 2,000 deaths.

238
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:40,312
The damage from radioactive fallout could
double that, depending on ground conditions.

239
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,958
I can accept that.

240
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:47,797
You're aware that our intelligence suggests
their government can't control Fayed either.

241
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,952
They are doing the best that they can.

242
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:54,271
And I'm saying they need to
figure out a way to do better.

243
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:57,670
Something tells me
that once this bomb hits, they will.

244
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,832
If this bomb hits, the opposite will hold true.

245
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:05,436
Moderates will be driven from power,
the terrorist position will be strengthened,

246
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,798
and I don't hear anyone talking about
the Chinese or Russian response to this.

247
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,155
We could start another world war.

248
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,516
If I thought that was likely,
I wouldn't be suggesting this.

249
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,353
Mr Vice President, the stakes are too high

250
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:22,149
for this decision to be based on
your personal judgment.

251
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:27,189
It is my opinion that this course of action
would be dangerous and reckless.

252
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:32,389
Consider your concern registered, Karen.

253
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:36,393
But the debate is over.

254
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:43,077
America must start to stand up for herself.
The attacks on this country must stop.

255
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:49,156
As acting commander in chief, I believe
this is the best way to make that happen.

256
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,556
Admiral,

257
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,835
have a nuclear-strike sub standing by.

258
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,309
Yes, Mr Vice President.

259
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,918
Nadia. I never got those files
you were gonna send me.

260
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,788
Yeah, your system was overloaded
so I gave them to Morris to take care of.

261
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,394
- Morris?
- Yeah.

262
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,199
You really think he can handle it?

263
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,191
Well, he seems to be himself again.

264
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:39,829
You mean he's himself
because he had a drink and he smoothed out?

265
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:42,480
I don't think so.

266
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,430
Hey, what are you doing?

267
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:54,469
Setting up a reverse data stream
on the drone's satellite intel, OK?

268
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,472
Morris seems better.

269
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,755
Is that a question?

270
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:03,274
- Is he?
- Yes.

271
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,669
- Look, I need you to do me a favour.
- No.

272
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,830
I need you to check his breath.

273
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:15,268
If he's better, great. If he's headed for
another crash, we need to know about that.

274
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,713
Fine.

275
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,472
Thanks.

276
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:39,279
- What was that for?
- Just checking your breath.

277
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:46,031
- He's fine.
- Thank you.

278
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,475
Got to love this place.

279
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:55,269
- Tom? Tom.
- Yes, Karen. I hear you.

280
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,750
You can't be in favour
of Daniels' plan for a nuclear strike.

281
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:02,833
You heard the vice president.
It's a warning shot into an unpopulated area.

282
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,593
It is a military offensive on foreign soil,

283
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:10,231
and you and I both know
it will be impossible to contain.

284
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:17,470
You know this is insane. I know you do. I saw
you in that meeting, the doubt in your eyes.

285
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:21,155
Do not presume to know
what I am thinking or feeling.

286
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:24,073
I serve at the discretion of those above me.

287
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:28,950
You serve the interests of the president,
and Wayne would not sign off on this action.

288
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:32,237
Wayne was wrong.
Every decision he made today was wrong -

289
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:37,155
rejecting my security initiatives,
using Assad as an appeal to extremist groups.

290
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:40,630
- Look what we've been led to.
- You can't seriously believe that.

291
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,950
It doesn't matter what I believe.

292
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:47,951
As long as the president is in a coma,
Daniels is the acting commander in chief.

293
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,395
If you want him to abort that missile launch,

294
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:55,474
you had better pray
that CTU can find and stop that drone.

295
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,990
We've got ground teams
looking for Fayed and Gredenko.

296
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:06,470
Sat support's dedicated to the drone
so there's not much to go on.

297
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:09,518
Caltrans doesn't have cameras
in the outlying areas.

298
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,309
We figured out how the drone
can stay hidden from our satellites.

299
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,949
Whoever is piloting it
can anticipate our directives,

300
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,508
- flying through the gaps in the images.
- How?

301
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,479
Our data is being relayed to the drone pilot
through a work station here.

302
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,949
We have a leak.

303
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,195
- One of our own people?
- It looks that way.

304
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:33,989
- Can you isolate the work station?
- No, it's being masked.

305
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:38,551
Morris is working on it now, but there are
over 50 stations. It could take an hour.

306
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,835
We don't have an hour.

307
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,951
Run a trace match on Nadia Yassir's station.

308
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,268
- Why Nadia?
- Do it.

309
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,828
- Just because she's Muslim...
- It's protocol.

310
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:56,232
She's already been tagged
and given restricted clearance.

311
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:00,074
And, yeah, she is a Muslim.
That's enough to go on.

312
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:03,990
Everyone here is thinking it,
even if they won't say it.

313
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,913
- You're a racist.
- Milo, I understand your distaste.

314
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,790
But we have to vet every system.
There's no reason not to start with hers.

315
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:17,159
No, sir, there's every reason. Nadia is 100%
loyal to this country. She is not a terrorist.

316
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:20,994
Is this based on knowledge?
Or because you're itching to sleep with her?

317
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:24,629
- You son of a...
- All right! That's enough.

318
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,112
Agent Doyle, that was way out of line.

319
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:35,196
We don't have time for personal differences.
We have to find who's subverting our system.

320
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,277
It is Nadia.

321
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:43,114
- The signature trace matches her computer.
- Shut down her station.

322
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,317
I'm trying. The only way
is to reboot CTU's mainframe.

323
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,789
We'd be without system power
for 20 minutes.

324
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,553
Get security on the floor now.

325
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,468
- Surrender your station.
- Excuse me?

326
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,076
- Who are you streaming data to?
- What?

327
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:08,869
- Where is the pilot?
- Doyle, dammit, that's enough!

328
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,557
- Take her to Holding.
- Bill, don't let him do this.

329
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,279
Bill, I'm innocent. I'm not a traitor.

330
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,908
Let go of me!

331
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,272
Morris, secure her station.

332
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:37,115
See if you can run a back trace on that leak,
find out where the feed is going.

333
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,191
Excuse me.

334
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,472
Victor,

335
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,915
what is the drone's current position?

336
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,310
130 miles southeast of the target.

337
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,517
Have you locked in the GPS coordinates?

338
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:09,038
Yes. The bomb will detonate
over San Francisco within 20 minutes.

339
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,157
Yes.

340
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:33,995
15cc's, and I want the drip to stay steady.
Add in some glucose after about an hour.

341
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,755
If you see any movement,
a twitch of the eyelids, you get me. Got it?

342
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,432
<i>(woman) Yes, sir.</i>

343
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:45,079
- Dr Welton, I need to speak with you.
- I don't have much time, Ms Hayes.

344
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:48,311
- What's the president's condition?
- It's worsened.

345
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,837
There was a build-up of pressure. We had to
induce a coma to relieve the swelling.

346
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,673
- I see.
- The good news is we stopped it in time.

347
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:59,878
Doesn't seem to have been any damage
and his vitals are surprisingly strong.

348
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:03,316
He's a fighter. We have that much
going for us. Excuse me.

349
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,198
- Doctor?
- Yes.

350
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:09,590
Is there any way to bring the president
back to consciousness?

351
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,830
I know this is an unusual request,

352
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:16,391
but it's a matter of national security
that I speak with him.

353
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:20,029
It could pose a serious risk to his life.
I couldn't authorise it.

354
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,475
Who could?

355
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:26,838
I'd need consent from his family.
His sister's here, but I'd advise against it.

356
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:32,631
If the swelling isn't contained, the president
could suffer permanent brain damage.

357
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,109
I have to go, Ms Hayes.

358
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,196
This is insane.

359
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,790
- Nadia can't be involved in this.
- The signal was routed through her station.

360
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,952
You really believe
that Nadia's helping the terrorists?

361
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:27,953
I don't wanna believe it,
but I really don't know.

362
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,270
<i>- (Milo) Doyle's an ass.
- He's doing his job.</i>

363
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:35,399
If we want him to stop,
we have to prove she's innocent.

364
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:38,472
- Hello. I think I've got something.
- What is it?

365
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:43,315
I've set up a feedback pulse. Whoever Nadia's
feeding her data to will read it as static,

366
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:48,030
but we may be able to ride the pulse back
to its source, find the location of the pilot.

367
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:51,999
- I've got it. 1530 Hillcrest.
- Hillcrest? That's close.

368
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,753
- Bloody close. Three blocks away.
- Tell Buchanan.

369
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:00,278
I'm asking you once again, cooperate.

370
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,555
Help me put an end to this.

371
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:16,275
I'm warning you, I will do what's necessary
to get the answers I need.

372
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,396
Do you understand?

373
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,636
Do you understand?

374
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:34,030
I understand everything.

375
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:38,953
I read your file.
I know what you did in Denver.

376
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:43,873
You enjoy hurting people. You get off on it.

377
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:46,269
We're not here to talk about me.

378
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:49,113
We're here to talk about what you know.

379
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:52,757
I don't know anything!

380
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:55,400
Get away from her, Doyle.

381
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:00,270
- I said, let her go.
- What the hell are you doing?

382
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:04,512
We got the drone pilot's location
through Nadia's computer.

383
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:07,637
- Where is it?
- Three blocks from here.

384
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:10,393
1530 Hillcrest.

385
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,878
We're not through with her, Milo.

386
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,989
Are you OK?

387
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,990
Milo,

388
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:34,959
you know I didn't have
anything to do with this?

389
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,948
Get out of here.

390
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,675
<i>(man talks indistinctly)</i>

391
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:43,273
- What's going on?
- We have a location on the pilot.

392
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,555
We're mobilising now.

393
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:55,319
As you know, whoever's piloting the drone
is operating in close proximity to CTU.

394
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,039
I'm instituting a level-one security lockdown.

395
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:03,638
All provisional safeguards are in effect
until further notice. Let's go to work.

396
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,956
Marcy.

397
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:12,033
Contact LAPD. Have them coordinate
with Tactical. Seal off the perimeter.

398
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,190
Yes, sir.

399
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,995
Chloe, did they confirm the address?

400
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:21,073
- It's a relay station. I have the building specs.
- I need a PDA and a phone.

401
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,559
- I'll get them.
- Thanks.

402
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:26,838
- Jack, what are you doing?
- I'm going with the team.

403
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:33,078
- You're injured. You should be in Medical.
- You should've told me about Audrey, Bill.

404
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:38,559
We were asking for your life.
It wasn't right to tell you about her accident.

405
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,108
- She was murdered.
- No one knows for sure.

406
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,077
I do.

407
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:49,677
Audrey gave her life trying to get me out of
prison because she thought I was worth it.

408
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,228
I'm not gonna let her die for nothing now.

409
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:57,678
I'm gonna finish this, then I'm gonna track
down the people responsible for her murder

410
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,035
and I'm gonna take care of them too.

411
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:04,233
Please, you have to let me finish this.

412
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:08,789
All right. I'll tell Doyle you're running point.

413
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,871
Thank you.

414
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:32,757
The drone is approaching the city.
Beginning descent.

415
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:35,400
How long until the bomb detonates?

416
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:40,315
At its current speed, the drone will reach
the target perimeter within three minutes.

417
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:43,392
It will detonate
when it reaches the perimeter line.

418
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:48,156
I'll bring it in at an altitude of 500 feet
to achieve maximum damage.

419
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:52,675
Don't worry. Everything is set.

420
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:55,069
It will happen exactly as you planned.

421
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:59,438
Concentrate on the task at hand,
then call me when it's done.

422
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,033
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

423
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:13,556
We're in position. The gate was open.
There's a truck parked behind the building.

424
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:18,953
The intrusion into our system is coming from
a room in the northwest corner.

425
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:23,716
I'm looking at a schematic. Your most
direct route is through the entrance to the left.

426
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,837
- OK. You get that?
- Yeah.

427
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:30,117
- Do you want me on point?
- I got it. Let's go.

428
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,191
Whatever you say.

429
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,189
<i>(clatter)</i>

430
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:59,748
What was that? Go check.

431
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,999
<i>(Doyle) Get a medic.</i>

432
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,548
It's Jack. Do you copy?

433
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:42,392
- We copy.
- What's your status?

434
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,914
The drone pilot is down. I'm at his controls.

435
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,276
The target is San Francisco.
Repeat, target is San Francisco.

436
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,828
Alert law enforcement and first responders

437
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:53,718
and open a channel
with the control centre up there.

438
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:02,036
These are for navigation.
There is no way to deactivate the bomb.

439
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:04,634
- CTU, we're linking you in.
- It's coming.

440
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:08,110
Is there any way for you to determine
the triggering mechanism?

441
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,555
They wired a GPS module into the bomb.

442
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:14,918
It'll detonate as soon as it crosses
its perimeter. I'm trying to steer it away.

443
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,470
Don't turn it too sharply
or it'll stall and you'll lose control.

444
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,595
Copy that.

445
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:26,279
On its current course, the drone will cross
the perimeter and detonate in 30 seconds.

446
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,029
<i>(beeping)</i>

447
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:32,954
- Jack, you're getting a stabiliser warning.
- I see it.

448
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,998
- 20 seconds.
- Come on.

449
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,516
Ten seconds.

450
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,750
<i>(Jack) OK, it's turning.</i>

451
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:55,317
- It did not cross the perimeter.
- I'm fighting a stall.

452
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:58,233
I'm losing control.
I need to find a place to land it.

453
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:02,635
According to the specs,
it's gonna need 500 feet of runway to land.

454
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:07,392
Closest to the drone's position,
there's a residential road straight ahead.

455
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:11,553
- Negative. Find an area that's unpopulated.
- Hold on.

456
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:20,275
If you can get farther east, there's an
industrial park. I'm uploading the coordinates.

457
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:23,033
Have Regional Command
deploy units immediately.

458
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,678
<i>(woman) Operations.</i>

459
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,716
Come on.

460
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,035
The drone is down.

461
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:13,313
None of the first responders are reporting
a detonation. The bomb did not go off.

462
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,197
- Jack, did you copy?
- Yeah.

463
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,874
Can we get a visual from anyone at the site?

464
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:22,238
I'm showing a fire-and-rescue unit
already arriving at the scene.

465
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:25,717
- What's the status on the pilot?
- He's alive, barely.

466
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:29,236
Do whatever you have to
to get him conscious.

467
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,271
<i>(sirens)</i>

468
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,591
<i>(machine beeps)</i>

469
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:47,559
- Get the Geiger counter.
- Yes, sir.

470
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,430
<i>(machine crackles)</i>

471
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,430
Move out!
There's radioactive material in this area.

472
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:07,432
<i>- Fall back and wait for hazmat.
- (man) Move it!</i>

473
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:34,116
Sir, I have Bill Buchanan on line one.

474
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,920
- Bill, what do you have?
- Mr Vice President.

475
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,912
The drone was intercepted
before the bomb detonated.

476
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,230
- Thank God.
- Congratulations, sir.

477
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:49,713
We were able to take control of the aircraft,
crash-landing it at the edge of the city.

478
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:54,794
But the bomb's core was compromised
and radioactive material was released.

479
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,314
So what we're dealing with is a dirty bomb?

480
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:00,870
Sir, this was not a dispersal device.
It was a radiological spill.

481
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,269
It was an attack on our nation.

482
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:10,351
- Are there casualties?
- Local responders got there first.

483
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,829
They were exposed to fatal radiation,

484
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:17,232
but so far it appears that radioactive material
was not widely dispersed.

485
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:20,198
Casualties should be minimal.

486
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:24,319
At least we've got that
to be grateful for. Thanks, Bill.

487
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:35,754
- Proceed with the warning strike.
- Sir, the primary attack was averted.

488
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,229
CTU was successful.

489
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:41,710
There will be civilian deaths
as well as environmental damage.

490
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,155
I hardly consider that a success!

491
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:47,232
The damage will be minimal
compared to what we avoided.

492
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:50,949
Sir, I think we should
consider ourselves fortunate.

493
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,234
Tom?

494
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,719
Sir.

495
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:57,998
Mr Vice President, we were led to believe
that this warning shot would be fired

496
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:01,675
only in response to
the detonation of a nuclear device.

497
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,115
That is a technicality, Tom.

498
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:10,952
I gave fair warning to the prime minister
and I intend to carry it out.

499
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,631
Secretary Kanin,

500
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:18,793
how long will it take
to move the submarine into position?

501
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,950
Once you've given the order,

502
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,508
within the hour.

503
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:28,549
The order's given. Launch the missile...

504
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,870
as soon as they're in range.

505
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:16,197
