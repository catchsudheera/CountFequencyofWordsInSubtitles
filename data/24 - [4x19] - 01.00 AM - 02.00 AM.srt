1
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,312
There's a convoy missing.

2
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,393
It was headed from Illinois to Iowa.
It disappeared inside the border.

3
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,234
- Disappeared?
- They were due to call in. They didn't.

4
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,515
I tried on comm stat. There was no reply.

5
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:29,558
- What was on the trucks?
- A nuclear warhead.

6
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,995
- They found us.
- Where are you?

7
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,435
It's over. They're gonna get us.

8
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,829
You have to kill Prado.
He knows too much.

9
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,636
Drop the gun.
Put the gun down!

10
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:46,599
- Who are you?
- My name's Joe Prado. I'm innocent.

11
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,070
Mr Prado's rights will not be violated.
Take me to him now.

12
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,836
- We have no choice, Curtis.
- A warhead's missing. This is our only lead.

13
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:59,710
What's going on? You've got a key witness.
We should be pressing this guy.

14
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:00,835
It's Mike Novick.

15
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:04,390
If we want information, we're gonna
have to do it behind closed doors.

16
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:08,075
- Torture him?
- I'm talking about what is necessary

17
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,071
to stop this warhead being used against us.

18
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,675
All right, gentlemen.
I'll have an answer in 20 minutes.

19
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,593
This thing could be over in 20 minutes.

20
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,355
What if I find a way
that wouldn't implicate anyone else but me?

21
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:23,352
I'm not gonna authorise that.
- You don't have to.

22
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:26,193
- What do you mean?
- Accept my resignation.

23
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,840
- And if I do that, what then?
- Release the suspect.

24
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,195
- Now you're throwing me out.
- Right.

25
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,152
Make a sound and I will blow your brains
all over the windshield.

26
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,798
- Where is he?
- I don't know!

27
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,314
Where is Marwan?

28
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:44,315
OK. OK. OK. Marwan's... Marwan's
gonna be at a place called The Hub tonight.

29
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,153
- Where is it?
- It's... It's just...

30
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,949
- Where is it?
- Just east of downtown.

31
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,031
This will help you with the pain.

32
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,796
- <i> Yes, sir?</i>
- The White House.

33
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,440
- <i>President Logan?</i>
- No, Mike Novick.

34
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,511
<i>One moment, please. </i>

35
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:38,036
- <i>We're still trying to locate Mr Novick. </i>
- Call me when you've got him on the line.

36
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,311
What happened?

37
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,470
- Prado talked.
- Who did this?

38
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,357
- Audrey...
- I represent DOD.

39
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,795
I have a right to know, Bill.

40
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,154
Did Jack do this?

41
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,278
Yes, he did.

42
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,352
It was the only way to get him
to give up Marwan's location.

43
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:03,000
President Logan gave Jack
the authority to use force?

44
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:06,038
No, Audrey. The president didn't.

45
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,031
Where's Jack now?

46
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,192
He's prepping a team to apprehend Marwan.

47
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,552
Curtis.

48
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,076
- You want to utilise LAPD?
- They'll lock down a ten-block perimeter.

49
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:30,631
Marwan's people are coming and going.
If we lock down, we give them a heads-up.

50
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,076
All right. We'll stay invisible.

51
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,799
Excuse me for one second.

52
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,598
What is it?

53
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,478
The clinic are treating Prado
for multiple injuries.

54
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:45,030
Audrey, what do you expect me to do?
Marwan has a nuclear warhead.

55
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,715
- He'll use it unless we find him first.
- I understand the situation.

56
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:52,509
Then you know what I did was necessary.
At least now we know where he is.

57
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,956
Logan gave you an order
not to use extreme interrogation methods

58
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,156
without his authorisation.

59
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,277
- Jack, you are acting against the president.
- I know.

60
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,113
- Jack, we're set.
- I'll be right there.

61
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,875
- All right, everyone. Let's move out.
- Look, I've gotta go.

62
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:11,430
Jack, you can't keep walking outside the line
and not expect consequences.

63
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:15,274
Trust me, no one understands
the consequences better than me. No one.

64
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,794
Jack...

65
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,514
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine. Why?

66
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,195
- Just asking.
- I'm sorry. I'm fine.

67
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:33,034
Look, for whatever it's worth,
you did the right thing with Prado.

68
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,751
Thanks.

69
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,837
Authorising the torture of a foreign national
is one thing, but torturing a US citizen...

70
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,070
- I can't...
- Sir.

71
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,278
This man, Prado, has information
on the whereabouts of a nuclear warhead.

72
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,794
- We don't know that for sure.
- No, sir, we don't,

73
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:03,715
because you're not letting
CTU do what they need to do.

74
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,473
I wanna wait till the attorney general
gets back to me with an opinion.

75
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,269
Mr President, we are running out of time.

76
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:19,430
Walt, you were the first one
to raise an objection to this.

77
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,229
- What do you think now?
- I think you need to make a decision, sir.

78
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,788
And sooner rather than later.

79
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:31,710
Mr Novick, Buchanan's on the phone from
CTU. He's called twice. He says it's urgent.

80
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,473
- I'll be right there.
- Yes, sir.

81
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,228
What should I tell him?

82
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:48,308
- Mr President...
- Don't press me for an answer I can't give yet!

83
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,480
I need more time.

84
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:17,508
Sorry about the delay. The president
is working through his decision.

85
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,875
The president won't have
to make that call.

86
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,872
- What do you mean?
- Prado gave up Marwan's location.

87
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,554
I thought Prado claimed
he didn't know anything.

88
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,358
He did.

89
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,149
- He changed his mind.
- You mean Bauer physically coerced him.

90
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,913
Tell me what happened, chapter and verse.

91
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,869
Bauer got the information we needed. I think
it's best if I insulate you from the details.

92
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,794
The president gave explicit orders.
You should have restrained Bauer.

93
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:47,237
With all due respect, restraint is
a luxury we can't afford right now.

94
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,231
What do I to tell the president?

95
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:54,394
Convince him to sign off on the extreme
interrogation, and we'll cheat the timeline.

96
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:59,156
I made the mistake of deceiving one
president. I won't make that mistake twice.

97
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,674
Even though we both know Bauer was right?

98
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,397
Mike.

99
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,077
Someone out there
has one of our nuclear warheads.

100
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,433
- <i>May I speak off the record?</i>
- Go ahead.

101
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,670
I'm worried about President Logan.

102
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,752
Worried? Why?

103
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:22,037
<i>His behaviour over the last few hours. </i>

104
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:27,797
I'm concerned about his ability
to lead us through this crisis.

105
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,189
I understand.

106
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,918
- Yes?
- <i> Where are you?</i>

107
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,355
At the location.
We arrived with the package.

108
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:08,353
- Has Sabir done the compatibility check?
- <i>Not yet. </i>

109
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:13,230
Call me as soon as he's finished, then I'll have
the next payment wired to your account.

110
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,911
- Is it compatible?
- I'll need to reconfigure the mechanism.

111
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,958
Is it compatible?

112
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,359
Yes.

113
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,477
- How long will that take?
- An hour, maybe less.

114
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:41,030
Then you should start.

115
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,711
- Girlfriend.
- She'll leave a message.

116
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:49,509
She's already left three messages.
I don't want her calling around for me.

117
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,353
Take the call, but hurry up.

118
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,998
- Nabila?
- <i> Where are you?</i>

119
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,719
- It's the middle of the night.
- I asked you where you are.

120
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,109
- At the hotel.
- Stop lying to me. I called.

121
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,078
You never checked in.
Tell me what you're doing.

122
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:07,551
Nabila, I can't talk about this now. Get some
sleep and I'll explain everything tomorrow.

123
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,518
After you've had time
to come up with another lie?

124
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,353
I found something on your computer, Sabir.

125
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,468
A bookmark. Do you have something
to do with what's been happening today?

126
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,269
- <i>How can you ask that?</i>
- Are you working with these terrorists?

127
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:25,875
Of course not!
You know I'm not a violent man.

128
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:29,430
- I know your politics.
- Nabila, enough! Stop talking nonsense.

129
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,751
- Is it nonsense?
- Like I said, I'll explain things tomorrow.

130
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,638
Sabir, listen to me.

131
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,632
She's fine. Don't worry.

132
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:47,399
I want schematics on the nightclub,
options for a staging area, and traffic control.

133
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,836
- Thank you.
- Bill. How could you let Jack torture Prado?

134
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,677
Audrey, it had to be done.

135
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,593
Logan made it clear
he didn't want Prado's rights violated.

136
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,035
He did make it clear, and he was wrong.

137
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,954
We can't break protocol because we think
it's right and expect to get away with it.

138
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:08,033
Normally, I'd agree, but here I'd rather
ask for forgiveness than permission.

139
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,839
- What kind of answer is that?
- The answer is, it worked.

140
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,831
We got Marwan's location.

141
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,069
Audrey.

142
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,515
With all due respect,
this is not Washington, DC.

143
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,798
Policy and politics do not always work
on the front line, where we are today.

144
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:26,193
Yes, well, Charles Logan is a politician,
and he is not gonna give you forgiveness.

145
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:30,068
I hope this does not come back
to haunt you or Jack.

146
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,358
If what we did gets us to Marwan,
we'll live with it.

147
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,997
What is it?

148
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,279
CTU located Marwan.

149
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,750
They sent a tactical team to grab him.

150
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,191
That's good news.

151
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,869
But I'm curious
how they obtained Marwan's location.

152
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,911
Did they use force?

153
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,560
Yes, sir, I believe force was used.

154
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,713
I'm sure I don't need to remind you
this is an extremely time-sensitive situation.

155
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,360
Who's responsible, Mike?

156
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,629
I'm asking you a question, Mike.
Who did this?

157
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,718
Jack Bauer.

158
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:31,517
I'm the President of the United States. I can't
allow this insubordination to go unanswered,

159
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,195
especially at a time of crisis!

160
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,989
I want Bauer arrested.

161
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:45,550
I agree that should happen, sir. But I think we
should wait until we have Marwan in custody.

162
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,471
No.

163
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:52,156
- I want him arrested now.
- Sir, Bauer is heading the field operation.

164
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,550
Bauer is not the only man who can do the job!
Put someone else in charge!

165
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,312
Mr President...

166
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:01,552
- Get me Secret Service.
- <i> Yes, Mr President. </i>

167
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:08,509
- Has Jack set the robotic camera?
We're still a few minutes out.

168
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,068
We're set to receive. Thanks, Curtis.

169
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,993
Get this to Audrey Raines
and have her stream it to DOD.

170
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,836
- Buchanan.
- Bill, it's Mike Novick.

171
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,229
I just got out of a room with President Logan.

172
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,232
<i>He knows how we got</i>
<i>the information from Prado. </i>

173
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,232
- How did he find that out?
- He's not a stupid man, Bill.

174
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,915
- I'm not gonna lie to him.
- You have to convince him to leave it alone.

175
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,516
- I tried. He's not going to leave it alone.
- Tomorrow he can bring charges against me.

176
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,670
I have to get back to the business
of finding Marwan.

177
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,355
- It's not tomorrow and it's not you.
- <i>What does that mean?</i>

178
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,477
- He wants Jack Bauer arrested.
- Arrested?

179
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,754
Mike!

180
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,588
Jack is heading up the team
that's bringing in Marwan.

181
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:55,708
We're aware of that. Logan's adamant.
He wants this dealt with immediately.

182
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:59,759
Anything less he will take as
a personal repudiation of his presidency.

183
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,796
What's more important? His feelings

184
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,678
or capturing the man
responsible for today's events?

185
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:10,039
I hear what you're saying, Bill,
but Logan's already called the Secret Service.

186
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,429
They're on their way
to take Jack into custody.

187
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:15,956
I suggest you warn him immediately.

188
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,192
Before moving,
we need confirmation Marwan's inside.

189
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:57,273
- I'll send in the remote camera.
- All right.

190
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,994
- What's your point of entry?
- Ventilation shaft.

191
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:06,517
Chloe, can you get the schematics for the AC
configuration? Send it over to my PDA.

192
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,036
<i> I'm on it, Jack. </i>
<i>I'll send it to you as soon as I can. </i>

193
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,793
OK, the camera's working.

194
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,231
O'Brian.

195
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,232
<i> We got an LA woman</i>
<i>reporting suspicious activities. </i>

196
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,072
<i>First tier wants it kicked up to you. </i>

197
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:42,596
- Cross-referenced an ID match?
- <i>She seems to be who she says she is. </i>

198
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:45,240
Send her information to my screen.
Put her through.

199
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:48,756
- <i>Here you go. </i>
- This is Chloe O'Brian. How can I help you?

200
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:53,152
I was just telling the man on the phone I'm
not sure who exactly I should be talking to.

201
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:56,835
I'm an analyst at CTU Los Angeles.
Why don't you start at the beginning?

202
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:59,798
- I'm calling about my boyfriend.
- What's his name?

203
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,314
Please understand I'm not sure
if this means anything.

204
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,709
You were about to tell me his name?

205
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,110
Sabir Ardakani.
We've been going out since grad school.

206
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:12,671
- Uh, can you spell that?
- Ardakani. A-r-d-a-k-a-n-i.

207
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,673
- Where'd you go to grad school?
- <i>Berkeley Tech. </i>

208
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,957
We were both studying engineering.

209
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,430
He's been travelling a lot lately.
Business trips, he said.

210
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:28,433
I'm not sure why I looked - probably
because of everything that's gone on today -

211
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,715
but I found something on his computer.

212
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,119
Tell me.

213
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,557
I think Sabir may have become involved
with radical groups.

214
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,790
- You mean terrorists?
- <i>Yes. </i>

215
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,349
- Where's Sabir now?
- He said he was going to Arizona,

216
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,112
but the hotel has no record of him.

217
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:49,192
When you looked through his files,
tell me what you found.

218
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:52,113
Most of his files were encrypted,
but there was one document

219
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:57,991
that's a schematic for a microchip,
a type I've never seen before.

220
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,714
- <i> Jack, do you copy?</i>
- Yeah.

221
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,473
- Buchanan wants to talk to you.
- Now?

222
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,676
He says it's urgent.

223
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,796
Fine.

224
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,553
- <i> Go ahead, Bill. </i>
- Jack, we got a problem.

225
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:59,758
- Secret Service is on their way to arrest you.
- What are you talking about?

226
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,593
Logan knows we violated
his order about Prado.

227
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:05,672
We can't interrupt this mission.
You gotta stall them.

228
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,753
<i>I've been on the phone for the last ten</i>
<i>minutes. There's nothing I can do from here. </i>

229
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:12,752
You have to get Marwan
before Secret Service gets there.

230
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:16,116
- Curtis, did you copy that?
- Yeah. I'll run interference.

231
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:19,078
Give me a couple of minutes.
I'll be ready to transmit.

232
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,798
Jack, we're ready.

233
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,993
Excuse me, Marwan.

234
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,389
I just talked to Abad in New York.

235
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:42,074
As soon as you're done, I'll upload the tape.

236
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,551
Good. I want this delivered to television
stations by dawn on the east coast.

237
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,756
It won't be a problem.

238
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:52,310
- Do you wanna cover your face?
- No.

239
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,279
I want the American people
to know who did this.

240
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,836
Ready.

241
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,231
People of America,

242
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:12,471
you wake up today to a different world.

243
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:16,951
One of your own nuclear weapons
has been used against you.

244
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:22,068
It'll be days and weeks before you can
measure the damage we've caused,

245
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,515
but as you count your dead,

246
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:28,752
remember why this has happened to you.

247
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,831
You have no understanding for the causes

248
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:34,390
of the people you strike down
or the nations you conquer.

249
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,517
You choose to meddle
in their affairs without respect.

250
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:42,116
You follow your government unquestioning
toward your own slaughter.

251
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:46,432
Today you pay the price for that ignorance.

252
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:29,033
The camera is in the vent.

253
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,794
I've got a visual on the main room.
Approximately 50 civilians.

254
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,350
Marwan won't be here.
He's gonna want to stay out of sight.

255
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:47,432
<i>Hold on, I've got a possible sentry. </i>

256
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,597
<i>A second possible sentry at the window</i>
<i>looking at the street. </i>

257
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:54,797
- Hey, Michelle, can you get a frame grab?
- We're working on an ID.

258
00:19:54,880 --> 00:20:00,273
I'm sending a freeze-frame
to the facial recognition software.

259
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:11,318
We have a match.
He's a known associate of Marwan.

260
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,516
That confirms it's a legitimate address.

261
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:18,151
But not that Marwan is there. We can't risk
exposing ourselves till we know he's in there.

262
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,595
Castle.

263
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:22,558
<i> Secret Service</i>
<i>is approaching your position. </i>

264
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,915
Jack, Secret Service has arrived.

265
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,835
- Did Marwan's people see them approach?
- No, they came out through the rear alley.

266
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,154
Moving over to the next room.

267
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:43,950
Unless you renounce your policies
of imperialism and interventionist activities,

268
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:48,716
this attack will be followed by another,
and another after that.

269
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:57,550
I got a visual on people,
what looks like a storage unit.

270
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,551
- How many?
- <i> Five. </i>

271
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:04,031
But they're talking to someone else
out of my sightline.

272
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,951
All right, copy.

273
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,156
Stand by, Jack. What's going on?

274
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,152
Secret Service. I'm Agent Moorefield.
This is Agent Wells.

275
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:16,030
We know this is a highly irregular situation.
We have orders to take Bauer into custody.

276
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,634
Curtis, let me talk to them.

277
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,234
- Go ahead, Jack.
- <i>This is Jack Bauer. </i>

278
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:24,437
We are trying to confirm
Habib Marwan is in this building.

279
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,715
<i>He is the terrorist who has a nuclear warhead. </i>

280
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:30,110
I cannot impress upon you
how sensitive this mission is.

281
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,033
The president was specific.
We need to pull you off this now.

282
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,429
I am in a concealed position.

283
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,671
You pull me out now,
you put this whole operation in jeopardy.

284
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:42,469
As soon as this is over I give you my word,
I will go with you.

285
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:45,836
I'm sorry. If you don't come out,
we'll have to come in and get you.

286
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:49,913
Secret Service Command has confirmed
the order. There's nothing I can do about it.

287
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,470
<i> We don't have a choice. </i>
<i>We're gonna need to replace you. </i>

288
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,676
Jack, this is Castle. I'm heading out to you.

289
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,672
- <i> Approach the south of the building. </i>
Got it.

290
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,832
- We're on the move.
- All right. Careful.

291
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:24,950
Marwan, the police are here.
Yasir saw an officer outside.

292
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,631
Start packing.

293
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:41,194
Hold on. I got a visual on Marwan. I have
a visual on Marwan. He is in the building.

294
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:55,633
- They know we're here. Move on the building.
- Our cover's blown. Everyone, go, go, go, go!

295
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:34,711
Get down! Everybody, get down!
Get down now! Get down!

296
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,356
Outta the way!
- Freeze!

297
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,150
I got him, Jack.

298
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:07,718
Marwan's men have escaped
through a hole in the wall.

299
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:11,110
Set up a two-mile perimeter.
Cover all utility access points.

300
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:17,274
Bomb! Bomb!

301
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,872
Jack, what happened? Curtis!

302
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,553
Curtis!

303
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:29,557
Jack, are you OK?
- Yeah. Check out the men.

304
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,870
Michelle, it's Jack. We can't pursue.

305
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:37,316
They blew the tunnel up behind them.
It's completely blocked.

306
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:41,871
Have LAPD tighten up the perimeter. Get
'em to tell us what this tunnel feeds into now.

307
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,153
Jack.

308
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,553
Agent Bauer.
Agent Moorefield, Secret Service.

309
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:56,636
I'm sorry, but I'm here to take you into
custody. Hand over your weapon, please.

310
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:04,880
- You blew this mission.
- I'm sorry, sir. I'm just following orders.

311
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,916
Has anyone asked President Logan
what the hell he was thinking?

312
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,754
Curtis, we still have to focus on finding
Marwan. We pulled up city records.

313
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,559
The building is directly adjacent
to a sewer line.

314
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,915
- How many ingress points are there?
- 30.

315
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,390
- Marwan's probably passed our perimeters.
- We have to keep looking.

316
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,439
LAPD and FBI will set down a grid there.
Coordinate your men with them.

317
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,590
We found a video tape on a man we shot.

318
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,955
We should be able to recover
most of what's on it.

319
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:52,828
Have one of your men come back with it.
Edgar's repositioned the satellite.

320
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:56,515
- We'll let you know if we find anything.
- You got it.

321
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,797
How did Marwan get past your men?

322
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:04,714
- They had to move in before they were ready.
- <i>Why?</i>

323
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:10,796
Secret Service showed up to take Bauer,
which compromised one of our positions.

324
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,191
I didn't mean...

325
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,638
That's not what I meant to have happen.

326
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,359
With respect, sir,

327
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,989
your orders were explicit.

328
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:29,992
What other search protocols are you running?

329
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,196
None. We're essentially without a lead.

330
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,554
Bill, give us a few minutes.
We'll get right back to you.

331
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,551
Standing by.

332
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,840
This is not my fault.

333
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:56,038
None of this would have happened
if Jack Bauer hadn't disobeyed my orders!

334
00:26:56,120 --> 00:27:00,477
I'm sorry, sir, but if you're asking me
to agree with that assessment, I can't.

335
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:08,676
If it wasn't for Jack,
we wouldn't have located Marwan.

336
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:18,115
CTU is waiting for us
to call them back with a directive.

337
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:22,318
What would you like me to tell them,
Mr President?

338
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,190
I have no idea.

339
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:37,476
And that's the problem, isn't it?

340
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,630
It is my fault we lost him.

341
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:45,759
This man, Marwan, has a nuclear warhead
and I allowed him to escape.

342
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,149
- Mr President...
- Stop.

343
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,759
I don't even know
if I deserve to be called that.

344
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:58,679
Whatever I call you won't change the fact
you are President of the United States.

345
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,593
I shouldn't be.

346
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:05,832
- For the good of this country, I should resign.
- That's not an option, sir.

347
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:10,994
Not without destroying the public's
confidence, which is already at its limits.

348
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,357
Three presidents in as many hours
would be devastating.

349
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:22,031
Then what should I do, Mike?

350
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,031
Tell me what to do.

351
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:37,277
There's someone who can
advise you better than I can.

352
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:44,478
You should consider bringing him in here
to help you through this.

353
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,319
Who?

354
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,153
<i>Keeler is in critical condition</i>

355
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,550
<i>after Air Force One crashed a few hours ago. </i>

356
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:58,316
<i>A White House spokesperson reports</i>
<i>the president was taken to a military hospital</i>

357
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,470
<i>following the crash. </i>

358
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:04,269
Sir, there's a secure call
coming through for you.

359
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,351
Thank you, Alex.

360
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:12,472
- Hello?
- <i> Mr President. </i>

361
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:15,028
- Mike?
- Yes, sir.

362
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,475
I'm sorry to disturb you so late.

363
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:21,917
No, I've been up all night following the news.
This is a tragic day for our country.

364
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:22,989
<i>Yes. </i>

365
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:26,675
May I ask when you received
your last intelligence briefing?

366
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:30,309
- Three hours ago. Why?
- The terrorist behind today's events,

367
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:33,836
Habib Marwan,
has taken possession of a nuclear warhead.

368
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,990
Oh, my God.

369
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,229
How?

370
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:41,199
Well, he recovered the football
from the wreckage of Air Force One

371
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:45,319
and he used it to track and steal a warhead.

372
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:49,359
- President Logan feels he needs help.
- What kind of help?

373
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:53,353
- <i>Substantial. </i>
- I'm not sure what you're asking me to do.

374
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:58,230
President Logan is requesting you run
the effort to recover the stolen weapon

375
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,517
and be in place to make
whatever decisions need to be made.

376
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,319
A crisis is looming.

377
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:07,710
Hard choices may need to be made.

378
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:11,395
And by the president's own admission,

379
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:14,233
he feels he may not be up to the task.

380
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:21,913
This country is very possibly about to face
the worst terrorist act in its history.

381
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:25,559
We need your leadership.

382
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:31,830
Before I do anything, I wanna speak
to President Logan face to face.

383
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:36,994
Fair enough. I'll notify your Secret Service
detail to bring you to the White House.

384
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:39,514
All right, Mike.

385
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,591
Thank you, Mr President.

386
00:30:56,360 --> 00:31:00,399
Secret Service rescinded the order.
Yeah, they're releasing Jack now.

387
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,959
All right.

388
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,519
Yeah.

389
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:09,152
Please step out of the car, Agent Bauer.

390
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,470
What's going on?

391
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:17,350
President Logan realised this was a mistake.
You're free to go.

392
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,834
I am genuinely sorry about all this.

393
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:28,916
Doesn't really help us with our situation,
does it? We had Marwan. Any sign of him?

394
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,958
We have people all over the tunnels.
So far, nothing.

395
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:37,198
- We had him. Dammit, we had him!
- They're not finished searching the tunnels.

396
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:40,716
If you haven't found him yet, you're not
going to. Too many ways in and out.

397
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,109
CTU have any new leads
on Marwan or the warhead?

398
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,031
- No.
- Great.

399
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:48,079
Load everybody up.
We're going back to CTU now.

400
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:51,388
All right, everyone, let's go!

401
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,672
- Edgar.
- I'm busy.

402
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:58,070
Release your system.
It's the only one with the random sequencer.

403
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:00,833
- You'll have to wait.
- Someone called a lead in.

404
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:03,150
I need to pursue this.

405
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:07,392
I have agents out there looking for Marwan.
I need to reconfigure the perimeter.

406
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:11,598
You don't need your system to do that.
They can just use the profiles on their panels.

407
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,477
Things are changing every minute.

408
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:16,597
They're field agents.
They don't need you to coddle them.

409
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:19,513
You know, that's a pretty rude attitude.

410
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,352
- I need your system.
- No.

411
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,640
- Tony.
- What?

412
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:30,395
A woman thinks her boyfriend may have
something to do with today's attacks.

413
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:34,234
- Did you verify it?
- No. I need to use Edgar's system.

414
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,151
- Why?
- Her evidence involves data

415
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,869
that she got from her boyfriend's computer.
It's in preparatory format.

416
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:44,590
- What's Edgar doing?
- Moving agents Jack and Curtis don't need.

417
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,591
- Edgar!
- Yeah?

418
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:50,593
- Let Chloe into your system.
- What about tactical? I got guys out there.

419
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:53,831
Marwan's long gone.
Most of those agents you can call back in.

420
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,911
Excuse me.

421
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,111
All right.

422
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,716
Yes?

423
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:45,189
<i>This is Morrison. Is there a problem?</i>

424
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:48,352
- CTU found the club.
- How'd they know you were there?

425
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:52,319
Must have been Prado.
Has the warhead been reconfigured?

426
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,753
Yes.

427
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,638
Then our timetable remains unchanged.

428
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,836
Marwan.

429
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:03,277
- We may have a potential security breach.
- Who?

430
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:07,273
The technician, Sabir.
His girlfriend's getting suspicious.

431
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:10,989
- But it's being taken care of?
- Of course. It's being handled.

432
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:14,356
Let me know when it's done.

433
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,674
- Tony.
- Yeah?

434
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:29,797
The woman who was suspicious
about her boyfriend panned out.

435
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:33,475
- What'd you find?
- She sent us a schematic of a microchip.

436
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:36,313
It's used exclusively
in legacy nuclear warheads.

437
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,470
Including the one Marwan has control of?

438
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:44,192
Yes. This is the design of the chip that
controls the trigger on the stolen warhead.

439
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,271
What do we know about the boyfriend?

440
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:50,433
His name's Sabir Ardakani. According
to his girlfriend, he's become radicalised.

441
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:53,910
I want his ID on an all-agency
distribution list, highest priority.

442
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,991
She thinks he's out of state.

443
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:59,152
He's probably somewhere
in the Iowa region with the warhead.

444
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,674
- Is this woman who gave you the tip local?
- Yes.

445
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:06,072
The rest of the files on his hard drive
are locked. We're gonna need a specialist.

446
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:09,277
We're gonna need to send a team
over there as soon as possible.

447
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:13,114
- All right. Chloe, I want you over there.
- What?

448
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,875
- Take a team with you. Let's go.
- I'm not a field agent. I don't do that.

449
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,279
Chloe.

450
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:22,876
We need a specialist. You're the only one
who can get those files off that hard drive.

451
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:27,033
I wanna know what Ardakani is doing
and where he is.

452
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:31,111
Chloe, I'm giving you an order. Go.

453
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:51,359
Edgar, it's Chloe. Does my panel have
a live link to the tactical network?

454
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,431
- <i>Not yet. </i>
- What are you waiting for?

455
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,592
- We don't do that until the agent's on site.
- I'm not an agent.

456
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:59,240
I know that,
but you're attached to a mobile unit.

457
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,959
I'm doing things by the book
like you always tell me to.

458
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:06,670
I'm just not comfortable out here. I wanna
make sure you have everything covered.

459
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:11,433
- You have your live link. What else?
- Trunk my audio in with Bergin and White.

460
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:14,512
I wanna make sure I can monitor
a two-way between them and CTU.

461
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,397
Done.

462
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:20,519
OK. I can't think of anything else right now,
but if I do, I'm gonna call you,

463
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:24,115
and I really hope you don't give me
so much resistance next time.

464
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:28,478
Chloe, I know you're scared, and I'll make
sure everything is covered on this end.

465
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:32,030
Why did they ask me to do this?
I really hate it.

466
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:36,557
While you were prepping,
I asked Buchanan if I can go instead of you.

467
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:41,668
He wouldn't let me.
He said you were the best analyst we have.

468
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,796
He's right.

469
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:48,435
I know. I'll call you
if I can think of anything else.

470
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:50,511
OK.

471
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:20,673
Hi. I'm Agent O'Brian. These are Agents
Bergin and White. You're Nabila Argamila?

472
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:23,752
- Where's the computer?
- Please come in.

473
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:29,795
Did Mr Ardakani keep records
other than on his computer?

474
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:33,714
- There are some papers in the bedroom.
- This is the computer?

475
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:36,758
Yes, but like I told you,
the rest of his files are encrypted.

476
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:40,310
- Are you sure?
- Yes. I ran a check to confirm.

477
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:44,237
I have a doctorate in computer sciences.

478
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:48,108
OK, let's see. You're right.
They used Bloawish algorit

479
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,760
- How can you tell?
- By the tab on the file headers.

480
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:53,593
- Can you decrypt it?
- CTU has a proprietary algorit

481
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:58,470
It shouldn't take long. We'll start by trying to
hack the password. Let's start with the basics.

482
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:01,552
Write down nicknames, pets,
anything he might have used.

483
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:02,914
OK.

484
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,275
- What was that?
- I don't know.

485
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,909
Go! Go!

486
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,153
In here!

487
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:25,033
Your men are dead. Open the door!

488
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:28,078
God. Don't you have a gun?
- I work with computers.

489
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,752
Open the door!
- Stiles.

490
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:32,513
- It's Chloe. We're being shot at!
- Where are you?

491
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,909
Open the door!
- Las Vilas. We need help.

492
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,991
OK, all right.

493
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:40,234
- Jack, Chloe's under fire.
- What's her location?

494
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,915
- 1482 Franklin, Las Vilas.
- How far out are the closest tac teams?

495
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,037
- I'm on it.
- Chloe, it's Jack. What's your situation?

496
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,714
- Barricaded in the laundry room.
- Who are you with?

497
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:54,112
Our informant. Bergin and White were here.
Bergin's down. I don't know where White is.

498
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,873
- I'll call you back.
- Chloe, don't hang up the phone.

499
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,793
Get her back on the line now.

500
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,398
Hurry.

501
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,310
This is Jack Bauer.
I need an LAPD response at 1482 Franklin.

502
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,109
We have two agents down, one under fire.
Where are the tac teams?

503
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,839
About 15 minutes.
- It's too long.

504
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:26,797
We open the door... We open...

505
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,836
Where are the keys?

506
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,514
Where are the keys?
Where are the keys?

507
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,315
- Jack, it's her!
- Put her on speaker.

508
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,073
- <i> How far away is help?</i>
- At least ten minutes.

509
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:47,879
- Ten minutes is too long!
- Just try to stay calm.

510
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:50,428
<i>Tell me where you are now. </i>

511
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,913
- He's shooting at us! The glass is bulletproof.
- <i>Tell me where you are. </i>

512
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,958
In the CTU car.
He's shooting at us from outside.

513
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:00,508
I don't have the keys. Can I hot-wire this?

514
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:03,910
No, it's secure. There should be
weapons stored inside the vehicle.

515
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,629
There's a rifle in the back.
It's locked. I need the combination.

516
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,836
I'm on it.

517
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,709
He's going.

518
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,792
- Where's he going?
- Wait. I think he's leaving.

519
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:36,837
Have we got the combination?
- Not yet.

520
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:43,593
He's gonna ram us!

521
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,790
What's taking so long, Jack?

522
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,388
Got it. It's 3-1-4-3.

523
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,471
- <i> Did you get that?</i>
- 3-1...

524
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:05,279
What's going on here?
What are you doing?

525
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,468
Go! Get out! Get out! Get out!

526
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:58,952
