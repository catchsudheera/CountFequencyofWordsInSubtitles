1
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,835
The Chinese are pressing the case that we're
involved in the assault on their consulate.

2
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,229
Have they found evidence
beyond the video of me?

3
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,311
<i>No, and we have to make sure they don't. </i>

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,995
You were part of the team
that mounted the assault on our consulate.

5
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:31,119
If you won't tell us who is
ultimately responsible, that leaves you.

6
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,113
- If it's Stealth, we can't track it by radar.
- Those missiles travel at a speed of 600mph.

7
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,760
It could hit a target
on either coast in under three hours.

8
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,038
That's assuming it's headed for the coast.
If not, it could hit its target at any time.

9
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,190
What is CTU gonna do now
to find the missile?

10
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,269
At this point,

11
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,672
CTU has no reasonable expectation of finding
the missile before it reaches its target.

12
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,194
I gave you the responsibility to stop this.

13
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,430
You've failed me, David,

14
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,795
and you've failed your country.

15
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:05,312
- Drop the gun. It's over.
Do it, Jack.

16
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,789
Do you really have what it takes to let me
kill him while you're looking him in the eye?

17
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,950
- Yes.
- Tony.

18
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,877
I have the power to give you a deal
signed by the president.

19
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,192
In exchange, you can help me find Marwan
and stop this warhead from hitting its target.

20
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,077
Show me the deal.

21
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,829
- <i>Buchanan. </i>
- Has the president signed the pardon yet?

22
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,117
Any minute. I don't like
that we're cutting this woman a deal.

23
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,476
- We can't verify she's telling the truth.
- We don't have a choice.

24
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,269
Only she can lead us to Marwan
and he's controlling the missile.

25
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,918
Has the attorney general
reviewed this agreement?

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,515
Yes, sir. We should be getting
his final approval any minute now.

27
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:59,833
Mr President. I'm sorry to interrupt,
but there's something you might wanna see.

28
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,515
It may affect the immunity agreement.

29
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,113
What is it, Aaron?

30
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,671
The woman you're about to pardon,
I'm pretty certain you've met her before.

31
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,478
Explain.

32
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,835
- May I?
- Absolutely.

33
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,795
On the right is the hostile we have in custody.

34
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:26,748
On the left is news footage from
four and a half years ago in Los Angeles,

35
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:30,150
moments before the attempt on your life.

36
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:40,869
You're telling me the woman we're about
to cut a deal with tried to assassinate me?

37
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,154
Yes, sir.

38
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,710
- Novick.
- <i> The agreement is in order. </i>

39
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,870
All right. Thank you.

40
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:55,112
Mr President. The attorney general says
the immunity agreement is in order,

41
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,668
ready to be signed.

42
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,515
If I read this right, it grants immunity,
not only for what this woman has done today,

43
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,353
but for any crime
she's ever committed in the past.

44
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,510
That is correct, sir.

45
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,835
Sign it.

46
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:25,196
We're trying to get you the deal,
but we will pull it if the missile hits first.

47
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,798
I will talk when
my representatives confirm my immunity.

48
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,871
Not before.

49
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:36,396
Manning.

50
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,359
- <i>Todd Richards. Let me speak to my client. </i>
- Yeah. She's right here.

51
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,192
- I'm listening.
- <i>The document's signed by the president. </i>

52
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:49,829
- And is the paperwork in order?
- <i>Yes. It grants you total immunity. </i>

53
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,195
Good.

54
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,874
- Where's Marwan?
- The Global Center.

55
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:59,670
A helicopter is waiting for him on the roof.
That will be taking him to a ship.

56
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,672
If he flies low enough, he'll evade radar.

57
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,990
When's he leaving?

58
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,996
- Now.
- Get the chopper ready.

59
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,957
Alpha Four, have a chopper ready.

60
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,918
She stays here until we verify this.

61
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,113
Sam, this is Bernhart.

62
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,874
Capturing Marwan alive
is our only chance of stopping this warhead.

63
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,793
We are not to use lethal force,
even in self-defence.

64
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,233
Got it.

65
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,559
Let's go.

66
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,872
She's not answering her phone.

67
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,033
- She should have been here already.
- She said she was delayed.

68
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,190
We're not waiting.

69
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,748
How long is it to the ship
and international waters?

70
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,831
Ten minutes.

71
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,470
Something's wrong.

72
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:01,517
<i> Roger, Los Angeles Air. You need</i>
<i>to keep this frequency clear, you copy?</i>

73
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,398
Edgar, it's Jack. We're almost there.
Have you got confirmation on the target?

74
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:13,077
We've just repositioned the satellite.
The images are coming through now.

75
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,670
On top of the Global Center, I see a chopper.

76
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,115
- <i>Southeast corner. </i>
- Copy that.

77
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,431
I want you to take a southeast approach.
Stay below the building.

78
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,511
Yes, sir.

79
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,553
The missile's still on target. We've gotta go.

80
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:38,473
Just a few minutes until we're up to speed.

81
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,950
We have visual on the building.
Approaching northwest.

82
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,190
<i> Copy that, CTU.</i>

83
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,509
- OK, come up over the building now.
- Yes, sir.

84
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,152
Don't let him take off.
Stay above him.

85
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,390
- Go. Go!
- He's right on top of me.

86
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,428
- Go!
- The engine's out.

87
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,473
Put me in a position to bail.

88
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,511
There he is.

89
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,396
I got you covered.

90
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,157
Clear.

91
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,031
Tell me where the missile is.

92
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,714
Tell me where it is.

93
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,589
Tell me where it is.

94
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,514
No.

95
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,717
No!

96
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,837
No!

97
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,473
Bauer had orders to take Marwan alive.

98
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,109
- I'm sure Jack did whatever he could.
- That's not good enough.

99
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:16,830
CTU is searching Marwan's helicopter, trying
to find something to locate the missile.

100
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,831
- We're out of time.
- Not yet.

101
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:22,959
Mr President. I'm sorry to add
to an already difficult situation,

102
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:28,160
but the acting Chinese consul, Su Ming,
is on teleconference. He says it's urgent.

103
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,911
Put him through.

104
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,193
<i>Gentlemen. As we discussed earlier,</i>

105
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:43,670
<i>our consulate in Los Angeles</i>
<i>was attacked three hours ago. </i>

106
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,719
<i>A Chinese citizen was abducted</i>
<i>and our consul killed. </i>

107
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:52,715
We've already given you our assurance
that we had no knowledge of this attack.

108
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:57,510
<i>Which is strange, since one of your agents</i>
<i>has confessed his direct involvement</i>

109
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,068
<i>and implicated his superior as well. </i>

110
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,390
What are you talking about?

111
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,868
<i>My name is Howard Bern. </i>

112
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:11,033
<i>I'm a federal agent with</i>
<i>the Counter Terrorist Unit in Los Angeles,</i>

113
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,989
<i>speaking of my own free will, under no duress. </i>

114
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:21,200
<i>I participated in an unlawful assault</i>
<i>on the Chinese consulate in Los Angeles. </i>

115
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:27,877
<i>I was acting under the orders of special</i>
<i>advisor to the secretary of defense... </i>

116
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,990
<i> Jack Bauer. </i>

117
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,311
<i> Mr Bern provided details which</i>
<i>leave no doubt that he is telling the truth. </i>

118
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,153
<i>The full tape will be</i>
<i>forwarded to you immediately. </i>

119
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:43,711
Putting aside the question of how
this so-called confession was obtained,

120
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,836
what does your government expect us to do?

121
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,957
<i>Mr Bauer committed a crime at our consulate,</i>

122
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,554
<i>which is Chinese territory. </i>

123
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:56,236
<i>If he was acting without your approval,</i>
<i>he should be turned over to our government,</i>

124
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,029
<i>to be tried and sentenced</i>
<i>according to our laws. </i>

125
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,353
Mr Su, we'll get back to you.

126
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:11,559
Dammit, David.
You said this would be handled.

127
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,313
I'm sure the Chinese don't want war.

128
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,994
No. But they do want to embarrass us.

129
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:21,437
Take the moral high ground
in the court of world opinion.

130
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:24,796
We need to take
the least damaging course of action.

131
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:29,112
- Unfortunately, then, there's only one option.
- Which is?

132
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,237
- We hand Bauer over to the Chinese.
- Unacceptable.

133
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,949
Besides, if we turn him over,
he'll implicate this administration.

134
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:39,191
The Chinese made Bern talk.
They'll do the same with Bauer.

135
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,874
Bauer would never
compromise national security.

136
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,952
As much as I'd like to believe that,
everyone breaks.

137
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,474
What you believe is irrelevant.

138
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,549
There is another option, Mr President.

139
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,993
Go on.

140
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:02,550
Suppose something happens to Bauer.
Suppose he has an accident.

141
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,598
- That's an obscene suggestion.
- It solves a lot of problems.

142
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,033
Mr President!

143
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,877
This administration
does not condone murder.

144
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:19,509
And it never will. Is that clear?

145
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,955
Yes, sir.

146
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,031
I'm sorry, sir.

147
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,553
- Find anything on Marwan?
- We're still looking. You OK?

148
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:40,189
- Be better once we take this missile down.
- We have found something.

149
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:43,238
It's been shot up,
but one of the drive platforms is intact.

150
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:46,357
It's a tracking or navigation program,
with a GPS node.

151
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:50,911
- Adams has uplinked whatever's left to CTU.
- OK, thanks.

152
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,877
Buchanan.

153
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,030
<i>It's Jack. Forensics found something... </i>

154
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,873
Chloe's got it.
She's trying to download the interface.

155
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:01,350
- <i> Put her on. </i>
- I'll put you on speaker.

156
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,590
- You're on.
- Got anything on that program?

157
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,558
Nothing yet. Give us a second, Jack.

158
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:12,712
- It's totally random.
- Maybe try a correlation matrix.

159
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,598
- What's that gonna do?
- Just do it, Edgar.

160
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,949
- I told you it wasn't going to work.
- That's cos you didn't expand the parameter.

161
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,234
See?

162
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,995
- What have you got?
- Two parallel columns. Data points damaged.

163
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,957
What do you mean "parallel columns"?

164
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:36,716
It could be a flight path.
I'll try plotting them over the US GS map.

165
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,910
It's working.

166
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,436
If that's a flight path,
it's headed due west over Nevada.

167
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,273
It's Los Angeles. It's gotta be.
It's coming towards LA.

168
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,715
Chloe, run a time analysis.

169
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:58,553
Assuming the missile travels at 600mph,
it puts it within this 30-mile segment.

170
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:01,552
I'll get those coordinates to the air force.

171
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,158
- <i>Clark. </i>
- Captain Clark. Bill Buchanan, CTU.

172
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:09,711
The missile's heading for LA. We've narrowed
the possible coordinates. Uploading now.

173
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,678
- <i> Squad's in the air, sir. </i>
- OK, thanks.

174
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:17,436
They have planes in the air. If our projections
are correct, they should find it quickly.

175
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:22,275
They better, since the casualty figures of
an LA air strike would be over a million lives.

176
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:25,796
- Including ours.
- Put the military channel on the speaker.

177
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,791
<i> Delta One approaching sector. </i>

178
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:31,873
Roger that, Delta One.
Still no joy target searching.

179
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,395
If the missile's shot down,
could it detonate?

180
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,598
No. The warhead is specifically designed
not to blow up until it hits its target.

181
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:45,353
But the impact could trigger
the arming mechanism?

182
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,874
- It's unlikely.
- But it is possible, right?

183
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:52,590
Yes, it's possible, but we don't have a choice.
We're out of time here.

184
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:01,877
<i>Delta Two, this is Pointcom. </i>
<i>We have a contact at 3846 degrees north. </i>

185
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,110
<i>Bearing 120. Respond. </i>

186
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:09,433
Closing in on those coordinates.
Possible contact. Breaking left.

187
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,395
I've got tally on the target. 12 o'clock.

188
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,155
- Missile checks good. I'm armed.
- <i> Cleared to lock on target. </i>

189
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,550
- <i>Target acquired. </i>
- <i>Good lock. Repeat, good lock. </i>

190
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,200
<i>Delta Two is in range. </i>
<i>Request clearance to engage. </i>

191
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:28,273
<i> Delta Two. </i>
<i>Target confirmed. Clear to engage. </i>

192
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:31,477
I've got good tone. Fox Two, missile away.

193
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:47,030
Splash One. That's a direct hit, Delta One.
Target is down. I repeat, the target is down.

194
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,078
Miss Dessler, here's the report so far.

195
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:12,948
No nuclear radiation was emitted
when the missile was destroyed.

196
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:17,272
Debris hit the ground and there was
some damage and several injuries.

197
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:21,353
- No loss of life was...
- We'll pick this up later.

198
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:37,792
- When they told me you were dead...
- I know. I'm sorry.

199
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,349
I love you.

200
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:48,479
I didn't realise how much
until I thought I'd lost you.

201
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,071
What is it?

202
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,516
When that woman called and she...

203
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,034
Hey, hey, hey. You did what you had to do.

204
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,918
But I didn't do what you did.
You chose me and I chose...

205
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,390
Look, we did the best we could, all right?

206
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,313
Now it's over.

207
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:27,159
<i> Did you get the information</i>
<i>that I sent you? And do you know yet?</i>

208
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,232
No. The commercial flights are still grounded.

209
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,834
I'm trying to get Paul back
on a military transport.

210
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,990
<i> Let me know if I can do anything. </i>

211
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:38,595
I haven't taken care of his funeral yet.
I need to call his mother.

212
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:41,319
<i>She doesn't know?</i>

213
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,233
<i>Well, just let the staff know... </i>

214
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:52,714
Listen, I'm gonna have to get back to you.
There's something that I need to deal with.

215
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,791
- Hey.
- Hey.

216
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,229
Your father said
you're going to Washington.

217
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,709
Yeah. I have to take care of Paul's funeral.

218
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,109
Yeah.

219
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,191
And after that?

220
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:32,198
I'm sorry. I know this isn't
the right time to talk about everything.

221
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,759
Maybe tomorrow we could get together.

222
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:39,308
Jack, I don't think that's a good idea.

223
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,477
We agreed we wouldn't make
those kinds of decisions today.

224
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,551
I know, but I just...

225
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,551
Audrey.

226
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:59,317
I love you. I want to spend the rest
of my life with you. That's all I want.

227
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,430
We both know that you belong here, Jack.

228
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:10,308
At CTU, doing what you do best.

229
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:16,396
And thank God there are people like you
who can deal with that world.

230
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:25,148
But I can't.

231
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,470
Please don't say that.

232
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,993
Jack.

233
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,077
Oh, Jack.

234
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,631
I love you.

235
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,909
But after today, it's just...

236
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,351
It won't work.

237
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,554
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

238
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,838
- This is Bauer.
- Jack, this is David Palmer.

239
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,595
Yes, Mr President.

240
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:18,036
Words cannot express
the debt this country owes you.

241
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:21,351
- Thank you, sir.
- Jack, this is hard for me.

242
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,034
But I don't seem to have a choice.

243
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,074
The Chinese have proof
that you led the assault on their consul.

244
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:34,676
- What kind of proof?
- <i>Howard Bern made a full confession. </i>

245
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:37,752
<i>He identified you as the agent in charge. </i>

246
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,512
And now the Chinese want me?

247
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,115
That's right.
And we have no choice but to comply.

248
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,628
I see.

249
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:48,712
<i>What they really want is you</i>
<i>to implicate the government. </i>

250
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:53,032
- Mr President, that will never happen.
- I know that.

251
00:22:54,560 --> 00:23:00,476
They'll put you on trial, propagandise about
American arrogance, and put you in prison.

252
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,511
I understand.

253
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:08,070
Jack, this is unfair, to say the least,

254
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,754
and I'm ashamed of my part in it...

255
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,037
but I promise you this,

256
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:19,319
<i>I will make it my life's purpose to bring you</i>
<i>back to American soil as soon as possible. </i>

257
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,516
I know you'll do what you can, sir.

258
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:27,434
Secret Service
is sending over an agent to CTU.

259
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,670
He'll place you under house arrest.

260
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,833
<i>But you'll have some time</i>
<i>to put your affairs in order. </i>

261
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:40,357
Jack, my friend,
I wish there was something else I could say.

262
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:44,319
Mr President,
you're doing what has to be done.

263
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,391
So will I.

264
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,071
I know you will.

265
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,478
- Thank you, Jack.
- Thank you, sir.

266
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,915
This is a messy situation.

267
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,390
<i>Even if Bauer doesn't implicate</i>
<i>the president in the attack,</i>

268
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,550
there are other problems.

269
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,108
Bauer's special advisor
to the secretary of defense,

270
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:17,671
which makes him a high-value prisoner
and a gold mine of information.

271
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:21,230
- The Chinese could squeeze him dry.
- You're right.

272
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:24,835
Plus they could share information
with any intelligence agency.

273
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:28,754
What they get out of Bauer
could find its way into the hands of terrorists.

274
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,796
This could set us back years.

275
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:36,398
- So the bottom line is...
- I don't think you need me to spell that out.

276
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:40,280
I assume this isn't coming
from President Logan?

277
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:43,830
Absolutely not. He's expressly forbidden it.

278
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:47,117
But that doesn't mean
he'd be sorry if it happened.

279
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:52,194
- So any investigation into Bauer's death?
- Will be brief and superficial.

280
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:55,670
- I'll see to it personally.
- <i>Fine. I'll take care of it. </i>

281
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,829
Good.

282
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:27,116
- The president ordered Jack be extradited.
- Cummings wants Bauer dead.

283
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,270
Logan shot him down. We were both there.

284
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,794
It was a weak rebuke at best.

285
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:37,478
This is conjecture,
based on one side of a conversation.

286
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:41,553
I know what I heard
and I know Cummings. You don't.

287
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,075
You really think he's capable of this?

288
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:48,516
He's been doing Logan's dirty work
for the last 15 years.

289
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,556
Logan's used to looking the other way.

290
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,518
I'd tell the president myself,
but he won't listen to me.

291
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,717
If you don't intervene now, it may be too late.

292
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,231
The prime minister's offering
to host a conference in London

293
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:06,198
for improving the flow
of intelligence information.

294
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:09,511
Tell him I accept his gracious offer.

295
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:13,275
You should tell him yourself.
He wants to congratulate you personally

296
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,636
for steering the country
so effectively in its time of crisis.

297
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,870
- Set up a call.
- Yes, sir.

298
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,398
David.

299
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:30,470
I have been overwhelmed
by the outpouring of goodwill

300
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,471
from heads of state around the world.

301
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:35,028
Well-deserved, Mr President.

302
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:40,033
You played a role, David.

303
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,674
You played a role.

304
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,236
Thank you, sir.

305
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:50,676
So what can I do for you?

306
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:56,911
Would you excuse us?
I'd like a moment alone with the president.

307
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,911
Yes, sir.

308
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,875
Sir, I believe that your security chief

309
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:11,158
may be pre-empting your decision
to hand Jack Bauer over to the Chinese.

310
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:15,791
- Pre-empting me how?
- By killing him before they can take custody.

311
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:19,429
For God's sake, David.
Cummings was just speaking hypothetically.

312
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,715
You can't take that at face value.

313
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:25,679
Besides which, I told him it wasn't an option.

314
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,152
I'm asking you to talk to Cummings
and make sure he understands your order.

315
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,708
I can't indulge some half-baked conspiracy.

316
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:37,554
I think I've earned the privilege
of having my concerns taken seriously.

317
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,756
You have.

318
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,479
But it's also no secret that your presidency

319
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:47,111
was infected with a certain level
of paranoia and scandal.

320
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:50,872
I won't allow that in my administration.

321
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:57,229
Questioning my security chief undermines
his authority and would compromise mine.

322
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,030
Hear no evil.

323
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,154
- I beg your pardon.
- You heard me.

324
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,558
David.

325
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:16,919
Thank you again for your assistance today,
but it's time for you to go back to civilian life

326
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,673
and let me do my job.

327
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,359
Hi, Jack.

328
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,237
Hey.

329
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:11,113
I found out Logan's making you take the fall
for what happened at the consulate.

330
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,555
No one's making me do anything.

331
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:16,074
The president didn't have a choice.

332
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:19,675
Yeah, well, that doesn't make it fair, does it?

333
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,399
It is what it is.

334
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,550
- This is Bauer.
- Are you still at CTU?

335
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:28,598
Yes, sir.
Tony Almeida's just about to debrief me.

336
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,318
Listen to me very carefully.

337
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,914
Do not turn yourself in.

338
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:37,755
The man they sent to take you
into custody has orders to kill you.

339
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,434
- Orders from who?
- <i>Someone in Logan's camp. </i>

340
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,829
<i>They think the Chinese will break you. </i>

341
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:47,038
- Logan authorised this?
- Not directly, but he won't stop it.

342
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,157
Now, listen to me. Get out of there now.

343
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,791
Thank you, sir.

344
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,914
Bill Buchanan,
regional director of Division.

345
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,673
Dale Spaulding, Secret Service.

346
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:31,672
You'll have to sign this before I take Bauer.

347
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:35,469
- What is it?
- Chain of custody authorisation.

348
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:38,313
I'm not signing anything
till Bauer's been debriefed.

349
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:41,392
When that happens, he's all yours.

350
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,993
Fair enough.

351
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:47,710
We'd be burying a million Americans
right now if it wasn't for Jack Bauer.

352
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,358
He's a hero.

353
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,079
I'm sure he is. I'm just following orders.

354
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:55,152
I want him treated
with the respect he deserves.

355
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,355
Of course.

356
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:07,549
Tony's on line one. Says it's urgent.
Something to do with Jack.

357
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,392
- Buchanan.
- Bill, it's Tony.

358
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,675
- Jack escaped.
- Escaped?

359
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,718
He took me by surprise.
There was nothing I could do.

360
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:18,998
He's still inside, somewhere in section C.
I'm the one who ordered the lockdown.

361
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:21,355
- I'll be right there.
- All right.

362
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,355
Bauer's trying to get away.

363
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,830
Jack disabled the surveillance feed.

364
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:50,038
- Were you able to make visual contact?
- Yes, he's still in section C.

365
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:53,078
Jack was willing to turn himself over.
What happened?

366
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:56,277
- I can't say for sure, but he got a phone call.
- Who from?

367
00:31:56,360 --> 00:32:00,148
I don't know. I was waiting for him,
next thing I know, I'm on the ground.

368
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,117
- Does Bauer have a weapon?
- Yeah.

369
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,794
- How many exits?
- Four. They're all blocked off.

370
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:08,270
- He'll try to punch through.
- I have two guards at each point.

371
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,316
- I'm not taking chances.
- What are you doing?

372
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,879
- Going after him.
- Wait.

373
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:15,839
I've orders to take Jack Bauer into custody.
I intend to execute those orders.

374
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:19,595
- This building is my jurisdiction.
- You lost that when you lost Bauer.

375
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:23,150
If you want me to stand down,
call the president, otherwise stay away.

376
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,754
- I'm going with you.
- No. I'm doing this alone.

377
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:29,310
Either you take Tony
or you're not going anywhere.

378
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:32,031
Follow me.

379
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,348
Jack, it's Tony.

380
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:51,000
Are you in here?

381
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,910
Come on, let's talk.

382
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:59,640
It doesn't have to go down like this.

383
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,109
Jack.

384
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,350
Give it up.

385
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,750
Stay out of my way.

386
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,351
This is over.

387
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:27,356
I'm gonna go break Jack out. You wanna
stop me, you can shoot me in the back.

388
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,558
Jack.

389
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,598
I'm putting my weapon down. I'm coming in.

390
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,397
Jack.

391
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,072
Jack.

392
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,554
He's dead.

393
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,271
- You killed him.
- He was shooting at us.

394
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:27,117
He was aiming wide. He was laying down
cover fire. If he wanted to, he'd have hit us.

395
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,359
My God, Jack.

396
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,431
You killed him, you son of a bitch!

397
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,511
Get him outta here!

398
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:36,114
Take him to the situation room.

399
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,190
I'm sorry.

400
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,271
Oh, God, Jack.

401
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,156
Give me the epinephrine.

402
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,269
I hope it's not too late. He really looks dead.

403
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,590
That was the idea, Chloe.

404
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:31,272
How fast is it supposed to take effect?

405
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,911
Come on, Jack.

406
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,348
Come on, man.

407
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,589
Tony...

408
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,274
Come on, Jack. Dammit!

409
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,549
Hey.

410
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:00,108
Hey, can you hear me?

411
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,714
- You know where you are?
- Yeah.

412
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:07,677
Chloe, run interference with the local coroner.

413
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:11,355
Until we can switch bodies. Sync up
their database with Jack's information.

414
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,193
- That won't cover the autopsy.
- There won't be one.

415
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:17,397
They wanted Jack dead. Now he's dead.

416
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,513
Bill.

417
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:34,357
I just talked to my father. He said Jack was
being handed to the Chinese government.

418
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,829
He was supposed to be.

419
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:39,798
But he tried to escape.

420
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,155
I don't understand.

421
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,992
Neither do I.

422
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,198
No.

423
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:59,593
- Audrey.
- No. Don't say it.

424
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,716
No.

425
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,836
I'm sorry.

426
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,350
All right. We're clear.

427
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:59,515
- Are you sure you're OK, Jack?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

428
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:05,876
You both need to get back to CTU
before anyone gets suspicious.

429
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:10,192
- You can drop me off anywhere up there.
- All right.

430
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:12,748
Your new identity
should get you across the border.

431
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:15,195
OK. Did you get me a clean phone?

432
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:20,957
Yeah. It has a scramble filter.
You can talk up to one minute undetected.

433
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:34,793
I can't thank you both enough for everything.

434
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,951
You gotta get going.

435
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,317
Jack.

436
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,275
Be careful.

437
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,238
Yeah.

438
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,838
You too.

439
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,999
Thank you both for everything.

440
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:39,188
- Palmer.
- Mr President. It's Jack Bauer.

441
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:45,112
- You threaded the eye of the needle.
- I had some help, sir.

442
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:50,718
I wanted to thank you for advising me of
the situation. Mr President, you saved my life.

443
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,394
I'm only sorry it came to this.

444
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:56,358
Me too, sir. I just wanted
to let you know that I was out.

445
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:58,431
I'm glad.

446
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,836
This is probably the last time we'll ever speak.

447
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:10,555
Jack, you do understand, when you hang up,
for all intents and purposes,

448
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,710
Jack Bauer is dead.

449
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,910
I understand that, sir.

450
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:20,792
Mr President, it's been an honour.

451
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:25,148
Same for me, my friend.

452
