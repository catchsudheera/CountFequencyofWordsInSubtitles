1
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,919
<i>- We're going to...
- (woman) Get Medical right away!</i>

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,516
Wayne Palmer won't be able to
continue his duties as Commander in Chief.

3
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,673
I have the fate of the West,
the lives of millions hanging in the balance

4
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,629
and I can't stop thinking about you.

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,238
<i>Bill Buchanan had Fayed in custody
and he let him go.</i>

6
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,676
<i>Karen Hayes put it in a blue file
over at Homeland.</i>

7
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:44,469
Someone will have to go down.
The farther from the president, the better.

8
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:48,314
- Are you asking me to resign?
- No, Bill. I have to fire you.

9
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,797
- Work with Milo, get cosy.
- Don't be such ajealous jerk.

10
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:55,190
The day I'm jealous is the day I kill myself.
Anything else?

11
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,478
How about, "Don't arm
nuclear bombs for terrorists"?

12
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:03,075
Sorry. That's not how I feel.

13
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,593
Yeah, it is.

14
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,796
No, it's not. Itjust slipped out my mouth.

15
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,029
Morris!

16
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:12,591
- You shouldn't have trouble running CTU.
- I'm not the right choice to take over.

17
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,159
You are the right choice.

18
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,233
Nothing will change operationally.
Your objective remains the same.

19
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,199
Bring in Jack Bauer before he can hand over
the component to the Chinese.

20
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:25,511
Mr Bauer. Let's do this.

21
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,477
Audrey walks out of here alone.

22
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:31,439
As soon as I see she gets down near
the bridge, I'll give you the component.

23
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,637
This is going down now, Nadia.
Jack is about to hand it over.

24
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,836
<i>Mike, don't let that happen.</i>

25
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,034
<i>(man) Cheng and his men escaped.
They're in three Hummers heading north.</i>

26
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,554
<i>- (man) Agent Bauer, get down!
- Weapon is down!</i>

27
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,359
- On the ground now!
- Who is your commanding officer?

28
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,158
I am, Jack.

29
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,118
I gotta take you into custody.
Where's the board?

30
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,399
Cheng's got it. I was set to destroy the
component till you engaged us in a firefight.

31
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,629
I had this handled.

32
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,870
Audrey, it's over. You're safe.

33
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,996
Help me. Don't let them do this to me.

34
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,718
Audrey!

35
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,873
They've done something to her.
You gotta help her. Please.

36
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,635
My God.

37
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,791
Was this the only C4 in the building?

38
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:33,873
Yes, that's everything. The building's clean.

39
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,677
Miss Raines, my name is Mike Doyle.
I'm a CTU field agent.

40
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:54,756
Did you see or hear something while Cheng
held you, something to lead us to him?

41
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,636
You're safe now, Miss Raines.

42
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,029
Jack bought your freedom
with a component

43
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:08,591
that contains highly sensitive
Russian technology.

44
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,877
Can you understand me, Miss Raines?

45
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:23,509
Help me, Jack.
Please don't let them do this to me.

46
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:37,038
I want CHP
to work with Military on roadblocks.

47
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,999
You need to set up three- to five-mile
perimeters from Cheng's last location.

48
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,230
I need satellite scans forwarded to me.

49
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:48,633
<i>- (man) We're at full capacity. We...
- I understand, but those are your orders.</i>

50
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:54,832
- You wanted to see me?
- I read your request for transfer out of Comm.

51
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,639
- Mm-hm.
- Is this because you and Chloe had a fight?

52
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:02,794
Your facts are essentially correct, but the why
I don't see as being anybody's business.

53
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:07,431
You've had a hard day - we all have -
but I really need you on the floor.

54
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,829
I'm sorry, request for transfer is denied.

55
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:20,117
I'm trying to protect you
from being caught in the middle

56
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,395
of an awkward professional situation.

57
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,789
You're asking me
to indulge your melodrama

58
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,155
in the middle of an international crisis.

59
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,310
Bill said he'd consider my request.

60
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,188
Bill Buchanan is not running CTU, I am.
I've made my decision.

61
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,158
- Nadia...
- Keep your personal life to yourself.

62
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,198
You can deal with this tomorrow.
We're done here.

63
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,713
<i>(phone rings)</i>

64
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,633
- Anything else you wanna say?
- Oh, yeah.

65
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,437
- Nadia Yassir.
- It's Mike. Do you have a lead on Cheng?

66
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,114
- We're on it. How'd it go with Raines?
- Not good.

67
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,112
<i>She doesn't know anything about Cheng,
where he held her?</i>

68
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:59,273
She's completely non-responsive.
Whatever they did to her in China,

69
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,079
it left her with a post-traumatic reaction.

70
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,628
District will want a specialist to look at her.

71
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,076
- Any idea what Jack was thinking?
- He had the motel rigged with C4.

72
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,915
- He was gonna take this whole place down.
- He was willing to sacrifice his life.

73
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,389
His plan would've worked
had I not intervened.

74
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:18,358
- You saved his life.
- But I lost the component.

75
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:24,879
Jack went against a direct order from the
White House. This was no one's fault but his.

76
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,951
We're on our way back.

77
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,311
Stephenson, you take Miss Raines.
I'll go with Bauer.

78
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,679
Audrey!

79
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,108
Audrey!

80
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,713
- Audrey!
- Jack, stop.

81
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,234
- Where are you taking her?
- CTU, same as you.

82
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,393
- Let me talk to her for a few minutes.
- You saw what condition she's in, Jack.

83
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,552
I know her. I know what she's been through.

84
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,712
I might be the only person
that can get through to her. Please.

85
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,839
You're under arrest. We'll discuss this at CTU.
Put him in the second chopper.

86
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,718
Mike, let me talk to her now!

87
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,955
CTU is pouring its resources
into finding Cheng.

88
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:29,715
This order gives them authority
to close ports and border crossings.

89
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:34,715
If we can't stop migrant workers crossing
borders, how can we stop an enemy agent?

90
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,873
I think the point is to slow him down, sir,
so CTU has more time to find him.

91
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,999
But I agree Cheng will find a way to smuggle
out the Russian component eventually.

92
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:47,437
So then Russia loses its defensive edge
against the Chinese and Moscow blames us.

93
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:52,435
We will do everything in our power
to prevent that, sir.

94
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,750
Thank you.

95
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,274
- Karen.
- Yes?

96
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:02,672
Tom told me about you and Bill,
how you had to... fire him from CTU.

97
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,990
How'd he take it?

98
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,071
Not well.

99
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,832
Karen.

100
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,911
Yes.

101
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:16,194
You and I have had our...
difficulties in the past,

102
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,669
but I want you to know that...

103
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,399
I value your role here,

104
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:24,517
and that I appreciate your sacrifice.

105
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,757
Thank you.

106
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,831
<i>(knock at door)</i>

107
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,592
- Excuse me, sir.
- What is it?

108
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,639
The Russian president's calling for you.
He's insisting on a face-to-face.

109
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:42,271
- Did he say what he wants?
- No, but he's on with the heads of military.

110
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,268
I want you both with me on this.

111
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:16,798
Palmer's in a coma. It looks like Noah's
gonna be acting president for some time.

112
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,677
Good for Noah...

113
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,479
and good for us.

114
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,757
The only thing he cares about
is pushing his foreign agenda.

115
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:29,470
Any pending legislation on spending...
he'll defer to me.

116
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,199
Now he is acting president,
we must be more careful.

117
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,714
We will be.

118
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,792
- I got half an hour.
- Let's stop talking.

119
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:59,390
President Suvarov, you're on a secure
conference with Vice President Daniels.

120
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,472
<i>- President Suvarov.
- Mr Vice President.</i>

121
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,519
You know Tom Lennox and Karen Hayes,
my national security advisor.

122
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,828
How can we help you?

123
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,753
<i>Some troubling news
has been brought to my attention.</i>

124
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,353
What would that be?

125
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:17,639
<i>The nuclear weapons that fell into
terrorist hands contained Russian technology</i>

126
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:21,713
<i>that, up until now, has only been available
to your government and mine.</i>

127
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,712
<i>- I'm well aware of that, sir.
- Then you are also well aware</i>

128
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,633
<i>that an FB-sub-circuit board
from one of the weapons</i>

129
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:32,430
<i>is now in the possession
of an agent of the Chinese government.</i>

130
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,836
<i>Do you deny that, sir?</i>

131
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:44,268
Mr President, all I'm prepared to tell you
is that... we're in control of the situation.

132
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:49,150
<i>Mr Vice President, my generals
have confirmed that this component</i>

133
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:53,472
<i>contains information that will
compromise our defensive capabilities.</i>

134
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:58,111
<i>You must stop the Chinese
from leaving your country with it.</i>

135
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,715
I don't appreciate being dictated to,
Mr President.

136
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,712
It was a Russian general
who allowed those bombs

137
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,950
to enter the US in the first place,

138
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,476
the same Russian general
who conspired to detonate them.

139
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:15,475
<i>That does not change our grave concerns
about this development.</i>

140
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,552
<i>If you do not intercept this component,</i>

141
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:23,316
<i>my generals have instructions
to initiate an appropriate response.</i>

142
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,312
<i>- Mr President...
- Good night, sir.</i>

143
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:31,632
- How did the Russians find out?
- Russian intelligence must've tracked it.

144
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,950
No. The information circle is too tight.

145
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:39,478
Only select people at the White House
and CTU even knew about this.

146
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:42,757
- You're saying there's a spy?
- There is no other explanation.

147
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:46,071
I will start an internal investigation
into White House staff.

148
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,152
I'll do the same at CTU, sir.

149
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:54,155
What are your reads on Suvarov?
How seriously do we take his threat?

150
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,232
Very. With the Chinese
in possession of the component,

151
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,869
the Russians will need to extend
their defensive line in central Asia.

152
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:04,589
- We have a military base in the region.
- Which the Russians must target.

153
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:08,593
- We will have to respond in kind...
- Which will escalate things.

154
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:19,077
Give CTU whatever they need
to find this man Cheng.

157
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:47,035
<i>- You should have the schematics.
- Yes, they've downloaded.</i>

158
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,554
I'm running a diagnostic
on the component now.

159
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,995
Good. We'll be there in less than an hour.

160
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,115
Wait. There's a problem.

161
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,430
- What?
- The circuit board is damaged.

162
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,956
- Can you fix it?
- No, not unless I have the security override.

163
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:07,511
We don't have access to that information.
Without it, this technology is useless to us.

164
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,831
You have to find someone
with the necessary expertise.

- Morris.
- Yeah.

173
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:45,071

Yeah.

175
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,874
Was that about us?

176
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,155
I asked for a transfer.

177
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,595
It was denied.

178
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,676
Why'd you do that?

179
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:06,073
Because... working with you
is becoming very uncomfortable.

180
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,071
I told you I was sorry.

181
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:17,593
You said I should
stop helping terrorists arm nuclear bombs.

182
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:24,268
We've both said things
that we haven't meant before.

183
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,158
Yeah, I know, but...

184
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,038
there's a line, darling, and...

185
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,395
and you crossed it.

186
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,636
So what are you saying?

187
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,834
I'm saying that...

188
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,115
it's over.

189
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,999
There's no going back. We're done.

190
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,239
Morris, look at me.

191
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:01,559
- You don't have to do this.
- Shh.

192
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,195
We're done.

193
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,756
Morris...

194

<i>(sobs softly)</i>

195
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,240
The situation has escalated
with the Russians.

196
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:38,596
They know the Chinese have the component
and threaten action,

197
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:41,069
unless we stop them
taking it out of the country.

198
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,230
- How did the Russians find out?
- A leak.

199
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:47,154
Lennox is looking into it here,
and he wants you to start an investigation.

200
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:50,118
- I'll let Internal Affairs know.
- What about Raines?

201
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,475
Has she provided any information?

202
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,632
Not yet, but the psychiatric specialist
has just arrived,

203
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,517
so we hope he can get her to talk.

204
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,752
- Do you have any other leads?
- Not at the moment.

205
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:07,517
That's unfortunate. I cannot emphasise
enough how important it is we stop Cheng.

206
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,718
If you need more resources,
you need to let me know now.

207
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,995
<i>Do you understand?</i>

208
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:17,036
I will.

209
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,315
One more thing...

210
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,793
To be honest, Karen,
what we need is Bill Buchanan.

211
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,314
<i>There's a rumour flying around
you fired him.</i>

212
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,836
- That's complicated, Nadia.
- Not as far as we're concerned.

213
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,559
You know more than anyone
how good he is at this job.

214
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:35,632
I don't see how this could happen
in the middle of a crisis.

215
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,632
Look, I'm not at liberty to discuss this.

216
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,871
Just keep me updated
with your progress in finding Cheng.

217
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:47,429
Doctor Bradley,
I'm Nadia Yassir, acting head of CTU.

218
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,592
We're under a time crunch.
I'd like to get started at once.

219
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:54,070
She's being prepped.
These men can take you. I'll join you shortly.

220
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,277
- I wanna hear your first impressions.
- Of course.

221
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,158
Nadia, Doyle and Jackjust landed.

222
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,836
OK. Have Doyle secure Bauer
and then have him meet me in Medical.

223
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,672
OK.

224
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:13,029
Can you leave us alone, please? Thank you.

225
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,395
Miss Raines?

226
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,073
Miss Raines, I'm Doctor Bradley.

227
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:23,915
I'm here to perform an evaluation to help you
remember whatever you can about Cheng.

228
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,116
Where you were held, what you heard...

229
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,270
It's all right. It's OK.

230
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,996
Come here. Look at this.

231
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:47,830
Please, you've gotta let me talk to her.
You know CTU's protocol.

232
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:51,959
You know how they'll interrogate her.
They'll make her retreat inside herself.

233
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,235
Please listen to me!

234
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,470
Sit down.

235
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,074
This will make you more comfortable.

236
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,476
Mike.

237
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:11,519
Please, I'm begging you. Take care of her.

238
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,232
Are you all right?

239
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,117
Come here. Look at this.

240
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,115
Jack's in holding three. How you doing?

241
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,949
White House is pressuring us to find Cheng.

242
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:37,749
We have to hope we can
get some information out of her.

243
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:47,875
This is Agent Doyle.
He was involved in rescuing Miss Raines.

244
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,838
- Do you have a diagnosis?
- She's a type-three catatonic

245
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:55,436
capable of following commands, repeating
words, but otherwise unresponsive.

246
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,795
Will you be able to get the information?

247
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,713
- Not without intervention.
- What does that mean?

248
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:05,112
She is suffering from psychological abuse
amplified by pharmacological agents,

249
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,636
as evidenced by over 100 injections
in her arms, feet and groin.

250
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:13,271
It'll be impossible to communicate in the near
term unless we shock her out of this state.

251
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,749
They used drugs, and you'll give her more?

252
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,479
These are compounds
used for different reasons.

253
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:22,189
- What are the risks?
- 22% of patients have cardiovascular events,

254
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:25,238
some of it neurological.
In extreme cases, death occurs.

255
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,673
- We can't do this.
- Doyle.

256
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,718
I am not comfortable
with the high percentage either,

257
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:33,190
but this is the only way
you're gonna get anything out of her.

258
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,999
Maybe not.
One of our agents has a history with her.

259
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,548
The Chinese put him through
something similar.

260
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,235
See what Jack can draw from her
before we do anything riskier.

261
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,039
- Doctor?
- Yeah, I know who Jack Bauer is.

262
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:49,830
I've read Miss Raines' file on the way over.
Contact with him will upset her.

263
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:54,118
But there's no chance of her dying from it.
Let's give Jack a chance with her.

264
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,031
It's not your call, Miss Yassir.

265
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:59,999
District has placed Miss Raines
in my custody and granted me authority.

266
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:05,473
I'll begin preparing for treatment shortly.
I'll let you know the results. Good day.

267
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:09,997
- You can't let him do this...
- He has jurisdiction. There's nothing I can do.

268
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:15,791
You can do what you know is right.
That's what Buchanan would have done.

269
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,872
- And that was uncalled for.
- Well, I'm sorry.

270
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,511
What I meant to say is, since you're acting
director, you can't be afraid to step on toes.

271
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,158
Does that go down better?

272
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:30,189
Part of being acting director
is respecting the chain of command.

273
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,589
But thank you for your advice.

- Has there been another threat?
- Yes, but not from terrorists. I'll fill you in.

It's very much here, sir.

I had NSA run a data sort on all
White House phone calls and emails

over the last two and a half hours.

the sub-circuit board was in play.

- And?
- During the same time frame,

294
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:31,475
one of our staffers called a lobbyist,
Mark Bishop, three times.

295
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:34,836
CIA had flagged this Bishop
two years ago

296
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:39,232
as having possible-to-likely contact
with Russian intelligence agents.

297

No further investigation was done
due to lack of resources.

she is working for the Russians.

00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,710
I don't think she did so knowingly, or she
wouldn't have called Bishop from her phone.

302
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:11,998
Then I... I don't understand.
How's this man getting information from her?

303
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,356
Well, so far,
we have found credit-card records

304
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:20,798
that show Miss Miller and Bishop staying
at the same hotels on the same nights

305
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,871
several times over the past year.

306
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,919
Now, I think if we dig a little deeper
I'm sure that we will find more evidence

307
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,675
that shows these two are sleeping together.

308
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,709
Then we have
a bigger problem than you think.

309
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,314
Why's that, sir?

310
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:41,957
Because I'm sleeping with her too.

311
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:53,589
She... she started working for me
two years after my wife...

312
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,229
after Nancy died.

313
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:05,394
I didn't think I'd feel anything
for another woman again but...

314
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:11,396
Lisa and I became close, and then last year
we were working late one night and...

315
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:19,428
You understand
how these things happen, Tom.

316
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:26,516
Dammit, what a fool I've been.

317
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:33,353
What the hell do I do, Tom?

318
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,550
You know, actually, sir...

319
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,395
handled correctly,

320
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:45,393
we may be able
to turn this situation to our advantage.

321
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:53,352
<i>(beeping, door unlocking)</i>

322
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:58,915
Mike, what's happening out there?
Will they let me speak to Audrey?

323
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,594
- I tried, but they're not going for it.
- Why not?

324
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:05,229
- The shrink doesn't think it's a good idea.
- Let me talk to him.

325
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:09,279
I wish this guy was interested
in what other people had to say, but he isn't.

326
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,271
Why?

327
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:18,310
He's got her in Medical. He's about to try
protocol of his own using big doses of drugs.

328
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,278
It could kill her, Jack.

329
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,999
Why did you uncuff me?

330
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,595
Cos I think you need
to do something about it.

331
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,840
Make it look good.

332
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,034
Easy.

333
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,996
<i>- (man) Vitals are strong. She's ready.
- Get her IV started.</i>

334
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,913
Excuse me, sir, you can't be in here.

335
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,114
- Have you started?
- No.

336
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,430
- What have you done to her?!
- Nothing.

337
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,228
Consider yourself lucky.

338
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:36,836
You're Bauer. I recognise you from her file.
Seeing you will only make things worse.

339
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:39,718
Shut up!

340
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:44,794
Audrey, I need you to come with me. I need
you to come with me now. Please, come on.

341
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,114
<i>(alarm)</i>

342
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,668
Just get me anything you can.

343
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:58,432
- Milo, what's the location of that alarm?
- Room six where Audrey's being treated.

344
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:01,193
Bring up the video feed.

345
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:07,553
She's gone. Lock everything down.
Get me holding room three.

346
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:13,272
If you'd just let Jack talk to Audrey,
none of this would've happened.

347
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,913
OK, thank you. Jack didn't pass through
any of the exits before the lockdown.

348
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,231
He's still here.
No one left sectors A through K. They're clear.

349
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,880
He's on the lower levels.
You checked the video?

350
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:43,715
- That's what I'm doing. It takes time.
- I know, make it take less time.

351
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,551
Where's Chloe?

352
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,676
- Morris?
- I don't... I'm not sure.

353
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,992
- Doyle.
- Have you found Jack?

354
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:58,390
No, not yet, but I'd like to know
how he managed to overpower you.

355
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:02,519
- I made a mistake. I got too close.
- Yeah, see, I don't think it was a mistake.

356
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,989
You wanted Jack
to have a chance with Audrey,

357
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:08,550
so you went there with the purpose
of letting him overpower you

358
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,473
and then escaping with your key card.

359
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:17,157
I did what I think is best for this operation,
and for Audrey Raines.

360
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:21,676
I have him!
He's headed down to the lower level,

361
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,753
but with everything locked down,
he'll only have access to corridors L and M.

362
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,229
I'm on my way.
Let me know if you find anything,

363
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:32,074
and have Doctor Bradley and Doyle
meet me there.

364
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,671
Hold on.

365
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,194
Let's go.

366
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:04,553
It's all right. It's all right.
I'm here. I'm here.

367
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,950
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm gonna protect you.

368
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:11,510
I'm gonna take care of you, I promise.

369
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,910
I know you can recognise me.
I see it in your eyes.

370
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,195
It's me - Jack.

371
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:22,751
The men who hurt you,
they can't touch you now. I won't allow it.

372
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:25,798
Right now, I need you to try and remember.

373
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:28,235
I need you to remember who you are.

374
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,629
Your name is Audrey Raines.

375
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,030
You were born Audrey Louise Heller
in Albany, New York.

376
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:37,954
Your father was the
Secretary of Defence, James Heller.

377
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:43,239
Your mother's name was Alicia.
She died when you were nine.

378
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,153
Please, Audrey, just try and remember.

379
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:51,476
Nadia? I've got Jack.
Room 237 was just sealed from the inside.

380
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,516
<i>They have to be in there.</i>

381
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,830
I see the room now.

382
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,953
Dammit, it's disabled.
Get an entry team down here now.

383
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,792
We need an entry team at door 237.

384
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:08,512
The men holding you, when they called me
they were within an hour of that motel.

385
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:12,354
When they moved you,
did you take surface streets or the freeway,

386
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:16,069
anything that can help us find them?

387
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:20,190
I want them to pay for what they've done.

388
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:37,352
I know what you've been through.

389
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:43,319
I know what it's like
to feel like it's never going to end,

390
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:47,234
to hate them that much, and then need them...

391
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:54,035
to start blaming yourself
for everything that's happening to you.

392
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:57,078
But they can't hurt you any more.

393
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:01,231
You don't need to hide now. It's over.

394
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:08,551
Please, give me a signal. Anything that lets
me know you understand what I'm saying.

395
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,438
Please, please.

396
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,678
It's all right. I'm... I'm sorry.

397
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,637
It's all right.

398
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,915
I know you're trying.

399
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,074
I love you with all my heart.

400
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,317
I'm not gonna let them hurt you.
They'll take you away from me.

401
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:53,676
There's nothing I can do to stop them.
We're out of time.

402
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:58,038
Is there anything you can tell me to help us
find Cheng, or where they were holding you?

403
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,599
Please.

404
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,915
Come here, come on!

405
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,839
- Jack, put your gun down.
- You put your gun down!

406
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:19,753
Get him out!
I'm not letting him take her back to Medical.

407
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,592
Jack, lower your weapon!

408
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:24,717
Not until I get a guarantee from you
that Audrey is safe.

409
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,392
Bloomfield.

410
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,552
- What'd you say?
- Bloomfield.

411
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:33,349
Did you hear that? She said "Bloomfield".

412
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:37,718
- I asked her where she was being held.
- We don't know if it's communication.

413
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:41,031
"Bloomfield" could be
a programmed response meaning nothing.

414
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:44,715
We'll soon find out. Morris, did you get that?
Have Chloe track it down.

415
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,711
<i>- Keep Doyle in the loop.
- All right.</i>

416
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:50,156
In the meantime, Doctor,
I'd like you to wait for me in my office.

417
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:54,472
- I'm not going anywhere. She's my patient.
- And she's my witness.

418
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:59,516
I suggest you go with these men, Doctor.

419
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,196
Listen to me, Jack.

420
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:13,432
You have my word,
I will not let him touch her.

421
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,795
Please, lower your weapon.

422
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:28,239
Audrey, please, it's all right.

423
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,709
He's gonna take care of you.

424
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:40,588
Jack, I need you to go
with these men to Holding.

425
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,671
Thank you.

426
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:03,749
Yes, of course, General.
I'll review the report with the vice president.

427
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,070
I'll get right back to you.

428
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:11,355
Suvarov wasn't bluffing?

429
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:14,193
No, sir. Air Force satellites
confirm the Russian army

430
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:17,158
is moving large numbers
of troops into central Asia.

431
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:23,429
- How long till they're in range of our base?
- They'll be in strike range within the hour.

432
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:30,954
I'm sorry, Mr Vice President.
I got back here as soon as I could.

433
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:38,790
Forward the report to the Joint Chiefs.

434
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:42,839
- Let me know their recommendations.
- Yes, sir.

435
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:54,509
What's going on?
Why is Tom talking to the Joint Chiefs?

436
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:58,991
Because the Russians
know the Chinese have the component.

437
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:01,116
- How?
- Someone inside the beltway

438
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,988
has been selling them information -
someone with access.

439
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:09,076
A man named Mark Bishop.
Do you know him?

440
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:12,914
I believe he's a lobbyist.
Are you sure it's Bishop?

441
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:18,759
Yeah. We began monitoring his phone calls
as soon as this came to our attention.

442
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:27,756
Ten minutes ago he called a known Russian
intelligence agent from his cellphone.

443
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:32,719
<i>- (Bishop) It's me. What's my next move?
- (Nikolai) You must reach out to her.</i>

444
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,156
<i>Find out if there are any developments
with the component.</i>

445
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:39,357
<i>(Bishop) I'll call her, access her PDA,
see if she has new email.</i>

446
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,431
<i>(Nikolai) Very good.</i>

447
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:51,478
So how long have you
known this man Bishop?

448
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:55,872
He's an acquaintance. He consulted on
a white paper last year on defence spending.

449
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:58,918
Dammit, don't insult me
any more than you already have.

450
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:04,711
Bishop's been passing intelligence
to the Russians that he got from you.

451
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:09,430
I don't know if he read your emails,
or if you talked about it in bed,

452
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:13,718
but the Russians know about the component.
They're threatening military action

453
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:17,156
if we don't get it back from the Chinese.

454
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:21,990
I always knew you were a good liar. I just...

455
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,711
I just didn't think you could lie to me.

456
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:30,920
- I guess I thought... too highly of myself.
- I swear to you, I didn't know.

457
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,915
It's still treason, which I don't need
to remind you is a capital offence.

458
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:40,109
You didn'tjust betray me,
you betrayed your country.

459
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:49,070
What do you want from me?

460
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:51,355
You're gonna go back to your boyfriend,

461
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:56,719
and you're gonna make him believe
that we have the component back.

462
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,394
- I can't do that.
- You can and you will

463
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:02,916
do exactly what Tom Lennox tells you to do.

464
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:07,755
And don't you even think about
trying to expose our... relationship.

465
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,675
If you go there,

466
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:14,958
I'll have you declared an enemy combatant,
put you in solitary.

467
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:18,555
It'll be years before
you speak to anyone about anything.

468
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,434
Noah?

469
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:36,034
You all right, sir?

470
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,792
I'm better now.

471
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:43,876
Secret Service is sending over a team
to work with her. We'll get this going soon.

472
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:10,392
I've made arrangements
to take you away from here.

473
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,517
I'm going to look after you, I promise.

474
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:16,956
You will get well, and you won't be alone.

475
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,593
I'll be right back, sweetheart.

476
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:41,389
Before I take my daughter,
I'd like to see Jack Bauer. Where is he?

477
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:43,471
He's in Holding, sir.

478
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:46,313
Escort Mr Heller to Holding.

479
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,358
Nadia. Did Audrey speak
when he was with her?

480
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,715
No, I don't think so.

481
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:54,189
Well, the name she gave us
might be a good lead.

482
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:58,114
Bloomfield Copper Company used
to have a facility in Jefferson Heights.

483
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:01,715
Forensics just found
oxidised copper particles on her clothing.

484
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:05,634
- That's where Cheng was holding her?
- It might be his base of operations.

485
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:09,395
LAPD's locking down the building.
I told them to stand down till I arrive.

486
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:12,313
- Good work, Mike.
- Thanks.

487
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,991
Mike.

488
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,430
You were right.

489
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:22,796
I should've stood up to Doctor Bradley.

490
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,550
You did.

491
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:29,916
When it counted, you stood up to him.

492
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:46,513
<i>(beeping, door unlocking)</i>

493
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,070
Mr Secretary.

494
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,390
You've seen Audrey?

495
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:07,358
I made Audrey a promise. I make the same
promise to you. I will take care of her.

496
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:11,513
- I will be there for her.
- No, you won't, Jack.

497
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,553
Excuse me?

498
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:18,189
I don't want you to go anywhere
near my daughter ever again.

499
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:23,110
Audrey went looking for you,
and this is how she came back.

500
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,112
What's happened to her is your fault.

501
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:31,109
I accept that responsibility, but I can help her.

502
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:36,116
Stay away from her.

503
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:40,431
Mr Secretary, earlier I got through to Audrey.

504
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:44,559
I can do the same thing again.
I just need some time. Please.

505
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,675
Now, I'm warning you,

506
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,479
stay away.

507
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,394
You're cursed, Jack.

508
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:05,429
Everything you touch,
one way or another, ends up dead.

509
