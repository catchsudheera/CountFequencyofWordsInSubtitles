1
00:00:14,765 --> 00:00:19,236
<i>We have waited patiently for you to renounce
this unholy pact with our oppressors.</i>

2
00:00:19,325 --> 00:00:22,714
We have heard nothing.
This is the cost of that silence.

3
00:00:24,485 --> 00:00:26,554
Choose to sign this corrupt document,

4
00:00:26,644 --> 00:00:30,797
understand that you will be staining it
with the blood of the remaining hostages.

5
00:00:30,884 --> 00:00:34,639
If CTU can't pull this off in time,
that's upwards of 60 people, Mike.

6
00:00:35,045 --> 00:00:39,960
If someone altered the recording of your call
with Palmer, the president needs to know.

7
00:00:40,044 --> 00:00:44,435
With the summit and the hostage situation,
he's not in the frame of mind to deal with this.

8
00:00:44,525 --> 00:00:48,313
Till the treaty is signed,
I'm not letting this out of my sight.

9
00:00:48,405 --> 00:00:52,443
- What did she tell you?
- It was a transcript of her call with Palmer.

10
00:01:00,004 --> 00:01:02,438
President Logan wants us
to go in the terminal.

11
00:01:02,525 --> 00:01:06,403
Yes, before the treaty is signed.
Curtis, what's your situation?

12
00:01:06,484 --> 00:01:10,193
We're in place and setting the entry charges.
We should enter on target.

13
00:01:10,284 --> 00:01:13,321
- I assume Bauer's in custody.
- I'll debrief him here, but...

14
00:01:13,404 --> 00:01:14,996
Bring him in, now.

15
00:01:15,404 --> 00:01:18,441
- Diane, what's wrong?
- Derek is inside the terminal.

16
00:01:18,524 --> 00:01:21,960
I see him. He's with the other hostages,
but he's not hurt.

17
00:01:22,044 --> 00:01:25,160
- Don't let anything happen to him.
- This is not your fault.

18
00:01:25,244 --> 00:01:28,520
- I'm the reason you went along with him.
- This is not over.

19
00:01:29,563 --> 00:01:30,792
Fire!

20
00:01:35,684 --> 00:01:39,802
We've got a problem. One hostage is missing.
He was working with the terrorists.

21
00:01:39,883 --> 00:01:42,317
- Give me a description.
- I'll help you. Let's go.

22
00:01:42,404 --> 00:01:44,838
Buchanan ordered to take you into custody.

23
00:01:44,923 --> 00:01:47,154
<i>Beresch gave this guy a key card.</i>

24
00:01:47,244 --> 00:01:51,282
<i>Something else is going down here.
We've got to find this guy now.</i>

25
00:02:47,043 --> 00:02:49,681
Sorry we have to bring you in like this, Jack.

26
00:02:49,763 --> 00:02:51,754
It's all right, Mara. I understand.

27
00:02:51,843 --> 00:02:56,598
A year and a half. How'd you manage
to stay invisible for so long?

28
00:02:56,682 --> 00:02:59,674
Apparently I wasn't as invisible
as I should have been.

29
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:04,751
<i>- Tyler.
- Mara, it's Curtis. Put Bauer on.</i>

30
00:03:04,843 --> 00:03:07,993
- It's Agent Manning.
- Yeah.

31
00:03:08,082 --> 00:03:10,597
The suspect was hiding among the hostages?

32
00:03:10,682 --> 00:03:13,435
Yeah, until the assault began, around 10:30.

33
00:03:13,523 --> 00:03:16,640
- Then he must have broken for an exit.
- What exit was closest?

34
00:03:16,722 --> 00:03:19,475
Without an alarm,
between gates six and seven.

35
00:03:19,562 --> 00:03:21,393
- Thanks, Jack.
- Yeah.

36
00:03:21,482 --> 00:03:26,158
Pull up external videos starting at 10:30.
All cameras covering gates six and seven.

37
00:03:39,442 --> 00:03:41,478
Hang on, guys.

38
00:03:41,562 --> 00:03:43,553
I'll log you out.

39
00:03:45,282 --> 00:03:47,477
You're good to go.

40
00:03:51,002 --> 00:03:53,197
We're away.

41
00:04:04,642 --> 00:04:06,792
Mrs. Logan.

42
00:04:07,761 --> 00:04:09,638
Mrs. Logan.

43
00:04:09,722 --> 00:04:13,397
Oh, my God. Help, someone!

44
00:04:13,481 --> 00:04:17,156
Something's happened to the first lady.
Get a doctor now.

45
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:26,037
He should be between gates six and seven,
just outside this vehicle.

46
00:04:26,121 --> 00:04:28,590
I got this feed from ten minutes ago.

47
00:04:30,481 --> 00:04:33,234
Try camera seven.

48
00:04:33,321 --> 00:04:35,391
Camera four.

49
00:04:38,481 --> 00:04:40,039
Tighten up.

50
00:04:43,121 --> 00:04:47,194
Yellow tie. Got him.
All right, let's follow him.

51
00:04:49,761 --> 00:04:54,151
- What camera covers the adjacent sector?
- 14A, but it's a bad angle.

52
00:04:54,241 --> 00:04:57,438
Pull it up anyway. Match the timecodes.

53
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,037
OK, got him.
This is two minutes, 25 seconds later.

54
00:05:02,121 --> 00:05:05,636
- What hangar is that?
- Hangar BB.

55
00:05:05,721 --> 00:05:09,508
- Has it been searched yet?
- No. It was outside the secured perimeter.

56
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,354
I'm taking a team over there.
Send this info to Comm.

57
00:05:12,441 --> 00:05:14,909
Team A with me. Let's move!

58
00:05:17,761 --> 00:05:20,228
Hangar BB. Let's go!

59
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,070
CTU. Stiles.

60
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,353
Jack told us about a suspect
hiding among the hostages.

61
00:05:28,441 --> 00:05:32,638
We just picked up surveillance on him.
He entered hangar BB at roughly 10:57.

62
00:05:32,721 --> 00:05:35,712
- Did you check it out yet?
- We're going in now. I need comm.

63
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,634
- On it. What volume is airport facilities on?
- Hennessey four.

64
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,914
Team two, cover the rear.

65
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:33,909
Check it out. Everyone else,
search the building. See what you can find.

66
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:41,074
It's clear.

67
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,235
Craig, it's Curtis.

68
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:16,518
Send a forensic team down here now. They'll
need a full biopack with spectrum analysers.

69
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:28,874
- Any problems getting the canisters out?
- No. They were exactly where you said.

70
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:32,349
- Transport on schedule?
- Customs documents are being finalised.

71
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:36,671
Good. The Russians will learn the
consequences of occupying our homeland

72
00:07:36,758 --> 00:07:39,956
when we turn Moscow into a graveyard.

73
00:07:47,998 --> 00:07:50,672
- When did this happen?
- A few minutes ago.

74
00:07:50,758 --> 00:07:54,592
- I came back in and I found her on the bed.
- What do you mean, "came back in"?

75
00:07:54,679 --> 00:07:56,908
You mean you left her alone.

76
00:08:01,878 --> 00:08:06,747
- What happened, Doctor? Is she all right?
- I'll do tests to find out why she blacked out.

77
00:08:06,838 --> 00:08:09,193
I didn't black out. Someone did this to me.

78
00:08:09,278 --> 00:08:12,395
- Someone attacked me, Charles.
- Shh, shh, shh. Marty.

79
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:16,187
You have to do something.
They're trying to get me.

80
00:08:16,278 --> 00:08:18,667
No one's trying to get you.
We want you to be well.

81
00:08:18,758 --> 00:08:24,913
- Listen, I had the proof, and now it's gone.
- What proof are you talking about?

82
00:08:24,998 --> 00:08:29,071
Proof that David Palmer called me
to warn me about today.

83
00:08:29,158 --> 00:08:32,230
Are you still on this?

84
00:08:34,318 --> 00:08:38,105
We've never been off of it.
You just wouldn't listen to me.

85
00:08:38,197 --> 00:08:41,587
Sir, is everything OK?

86
00:08:41,678 --> 00:08:45,875
- I think so.
- No! No, dammit, it's not OK.

87
00:08:49,317 --> 00:08:51,878
You people have got to listen to me.

88
00:08:51,957 --> 00:08:55,155
I had a document from the archive room.

89
00:08:55,237 --> 00:08:58,627
- Where was this document?
- I am trying to tell you.

90
00:08:58,718 --> 00:09:03,154
It was hidden in my blouse.
It's gone. Someone stole it from me.

91
00:09:05,837 --> 00:09:10,514
Marty, you've been under a lot of stress,
we all have. Let... No, let Dr Hill...

92
00:09:10,597 --> 00:09:15,512
Let Dr Hill examine you,
and we can figure out how to get you better.

93
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:20,273
You don't believe me.
You don't believe your own wife.

94
00:09:35,997 --> 00:09:39,546
I have a phone call from the secretary of state
I have to get to.

95
00:09:39,636 --> 00:09:42,993
If there's any changes,
get back to me as soon as possible.

96
00:09:43,076 --> 00:09:45,067
Yes, Mr. President.

97
00:09:45,917 --> 00:09:48,431
- Don't leave.
- I'll be right down the hall.

98
00:09:48,517 --> 00:09:51,429
- No, honey. Don't leave me.
- You need to get some rest.

99
00:09:51,517 --> 00:09:52,744
Please.

100
00:09:56,157 --> 00:09:58,352
Close that door.

101
00:10:09,917 --> 00:10:14,467
- What do I do about this, Walt?
- This is what she was like before Vermont.

102
00:10:14,556 --> 00:10:20,552
- Are you suggesting that I readmit her?
- Consider the option, for her sake.

103
00:10:21,956 --> 00:10:25,585
She said she'd rather die
than go back in there.

104
00:10:25,676 --> 00:10:29,305
Sir, if she's gonna persist
with these conspiracy theories,

105
00:10:29,396 --> 00:10:33,150
it's only a matter of time before
she talks to someone who believes her.

106
00:10:33,236 --> 00:10:36,114
Then we really will have a problem.

107
00:10:38,116 --> 00:10:40,232
I wish you were wrong, but I don't think so.

108
00:10:46,636 --> 00:10:49,433
Do you want me to handle this, sir?

109
00:10:54,556 --> 00:10:59,789
Make the arrangements.
But... don't let Martha find out.

110
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:02,390
Let me be the one to tell her.

111
00:11:02,476 --> 00:11:04,467
Yes, sir.

112
00:11:13,676 --> 00:11:15,984
- Yeah?
- Have you handled the problem there?

113
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:18,908
Yes. Martha Logan
won't be giving us any more trouble.

114
00:11:19,395 --> 00:11:24,992
Good. Erwich has completed transferring the
gas to the semi. He's on his way to the port.

115
00:11:25,076 --> 00:11:27,954
- The authorities don't know it's been stolen?
- Not yet.

116
00:11:28,035 --> 00:11:30,310
The only thing left to take care of is Bauer.

117
00:11:30,755 --> 00:11:32,950
<i>- Where is he?
- On his way to CTU.</i>

118
00:11:33,036 --> 00:11:36,550
He's getting too close.
He's started putting the pieces together.

119
00:11:36,635 --> 00:11:40,025
I know. He needs to be taken out.
I'm handling it myself.

120
00:11:40,115 --> 00:11:44,233
How? Once he gets to CTU,
your hitter won't be able to get near him.

121
00:11:44,315 --> 00:11:46,465
I have someone on the inside
who can help us.

122
00:11:46,555 --> 00:11:48,352
<i>Then use him.</i>

123
00:11:48,435 --> 00:11:50,232
Done.

124
00:12:15,874 --> 00:12:20,027
<i>- You sure those readings are right?
- They're right. 2,000 parts per million.</i>

125
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:22,947
- Could only be military grade.
- I'll tell 'em.

126
00:12:24,595 --> 00:12:27,062
- I need you to finish the shell script.
- Not now.

127
00:12:27,154 --> 00:12:28,713
Since when do you say "not now"?

128
00:12:28,794 --> 00:12:31,150
The hangar was leased
to an offshore company,

129
00:12:31,234 --> 00:12:33,589
but it's been vacant for at least 18 months.

130
00:12:33,675 --> 00:12:39,431
Sir. I just heard from Curtis. He was right.
There was nerve gas in hangar BB.

131
00:12:39,514 --> 00:12:42,666
- It killed the rats.
- There were traces in their blood.

132
00:12:42,754 --> 00:12:46,144
But the concentrations
were definitely mil-spec. Weaponised.

133
00:12:46,234 --> 00:12:49,943
So the suspect Bauer told us about,
that's why he was at the airport?

134
00:12:50,034 --> 00:12:52,229
To steal canisters of nerve gas?

135
00:12:52,314 --> 00:12:55,909
Stealing from whom? The military
destroyed its stockpiles years ago.

136
00:12:55,994 --> 00:12:59,225
Maybe this nerve gas
wasn't produced by the military.

137
00:13:01,754 --> 00:13:05,952
Have Forensics get a signature off the trace.
See if they can tell who manufactured it.

138
00:13:06,034 --> 00:13:12,030
Chloe, elevate our alert status. Activate all
available personnel and get Curtis back here.

139
00:13:13,514 --> 00:13:15,869
Don't issue a statement
about the first lady yet.

140
00:13:15,953 --> 00:13:19,390
Let your successes today
run front and centre on all networks.

141
00:13:19,474 --> 00:13:21,270
That sounds right.

142
00:13:21,794 --> 00:13:24,183
Dr Hill, please, come in.

143
00:13:25,273 --> 00:13:27,390
- How's Martha doing?
- She's asleep.

144
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,464
What caused the blackout?

145
00:13:29,553 --> 00:13:34,674
I spoke with her psychiatrist, and
none of her medication would have caused it.

146
00:13:34,753 --> 00:13:38,428
- So we still don't know what it was?
- Not yet, no.

147
00:13:38,514 --> 00:13:42,028
Mr. President,
I need to speak to you and Walt alone.

148
00:13:42,954 --> 00:13:45,468
Thank you, Doctor. Keep a close eye on her.

149
00:13:45,554 --> 00:13:49,148
- We'll talk soon.
- Yes, Mr. President.

150
00:13:50,793 --> 00:13:52,306
What's up?

151
00:13:52,394 --> 00:13:55,783
The situation at the airport
has taken an unexpected turn.

152
00:13:55,873 --> 00:14:00,072
What? The hostages were saved,
we've captured or killed the terrorists.

153
00:14:00,153 --> 00:14:03,463
Not all of them. One of the terrorists
was posing as a hostage.

154
00:14:03,553 --> 00:14:07,831
- He used the hostage crisis to cover a theft.
- A theft? What was stolen?

155
00:14:07,914 --> 00:14:10,711
A cache of chemical weapons.

156
00:14:10,793 --> 00:14:13,068
What kind of chemical weapons?

157
00:14:13,153 --> 00:14:14,666
Nerve gas.

158
00:14:18,953 --> 00:14:22,229
- Is it ours?
- No, sir. CTU is still trying to source it.

159
00:14:22,313 --> 00:14:25,190
But it was buried in a bunker at the airport.

160
00:14:25,273 --> 00:14:28,310
It seems this man
had another crew waiting for him there.

161
00:14:28,393 --> 00:14:31,146
Do we have any idea
what the terrorists are planning?

162
00:14:31,233 --> 00:14:34,668
They haven't made any demands
or issued any threats yet.

163
00:14:34,753 --> 00:14:37,142
Well, what are we doing to stop them?

164
00:14:37,233 --> 00:14:43,546
CTU is running an interagency search effort.
They're coordinating ground operations.

165
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:48,661
- Has the press found out about this yet?
- No, sir. It's being kept internal.

166
00:14:53,072 --> 00:14:55,950
Whatever retaliation
we were bracing for is nothing

167
00:14:56,033 --> 00:14:58,467
compared to what
these people are capable of now.

168
00:14:58,552 --> 00:15:04,468
Sir, I'll assemble the Homeland Security team
to discuss evacuation scenarios.

169
00:15:15,673 --> 00:15:19,187
I've sent everyone updates
on the airport forensics. What next?

170
00:15:19,272 --> 00:15:25,063
Check the task list. You don't need to ask me
every time you need something new to do.

171
00:15:25,152 --> 00:15:29,350
I don't care if you are my boss,
or if you regret sleeping with me last night.

172
00:15:29,432 --> 00:15:32,947
- No one talks to me like that.
- Really? I just did.

173
00:15:38,552 --> 00:15:41,066
Yeah.

174
00:15:59,832 --> 00:16:02,300
- What's your problem?
- I don't have a problem.

175
00:16:02,392 --> 00:16:05,542
- Then what do you want?
- Nothing.

176
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,428
Edgar.

177
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:11,628
I'm sorry that my private life
hasn't remained private.

178
00:16:11,711 --> 00:16:14,271
- I'm thinking the opposite.
- What do you mean?

179
00:16:14,352 --> 00:16:19,505
You're too private. We've known each other
years. And I find out you're keeping secrets?

180
00:16:19,592 --> 00:16:22,265
People keep secrets.

181
00:16:22,351 --> 00:16:25,388
I don't. Not from my friends.

182
00:16:25,472 --> 00:16:27,701
Why didn't you tell me Jack was alive?

183
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:30,464
Oh, come on. It's called "national security".

184
00:16:30,551 --> 00:16:34,624
Yeah, well, what about Spenser?
I didn't even know you two were going out.

185
00:16:34,711 --> 00:16:37,589
Oh, give me a break.

186
00:16:38,231 --> 00:16:40,699
When we find the gas
and the alert level drops,

187
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:46,149
we can have some camomile tea
and I'll tell you all my secrets, OK?

188
00:16:53,431 --> 00:16:56,183
- You paged me?
- Has Bauer arrived at CTU?

189
00:16:56,271 --> 00:16:59,387
- No, not yet.
- When he does, I need you to do something.

190
00:16:59,471 --> 00:17:02,429
We have our hands full
searching for the nerve gas.

191
00:17:02,511 --> 00:17:07,266
Bauer is a priority.
I need you to clear an entrance into CTU.

192
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:09,739
I'm sending it now. OK.

193
00:17:11,111 --> 00:17:13,465
- Ms Raines?
- I'll get back to you. Yes?

194
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:17,339
- I take it you're up to speed on the nerve gas?
- I was just filling in DOD.

195
00:17:17,431 --> 00:17:21,106
Diane Huxley was brought in to be debriefed.
I'd like you to interview her.

196
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:22,543
Interview her about what?

197
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:25,019
Anything that could help us
find the nerve gas.

198
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:29,389
- What could she know about that?
- I've reviewed the evidence against Bauer,

199
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:33,588
and I'm inclined to agree that he was framed
for the assassination of Palmer.

200
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:35,946
- Thank you.
- I think whoever framed Jack

201
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:38,305
is also involved with the nerve gas,

202
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:41,780
which means Huxley
could have had contact with that person.

203
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:44,862
Uh, I'm not a trained interrogator.

204
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:48,704
But you know Jack Bauer,
better than anyone else in here.

205
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:52,226
You have something in common with her.
It might help her open up.

206
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:56,098
I realise it's awkward, but I need you to do it.

207
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:00,662
Fine.

208
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:04,059
- I'll see what I can get from her.
- Thank you.

209
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:09,101
- Where is she?
- She and her son just cleared security.

210
00:18:17,709 --> 00:18:22,022
- Miss Huxley, I'm Audrey Raines.
- Hi. This is my son Derek.

211
00:18:22,109 --> 00:18:26,945
Hi. I want you to be checked out
by a doctor while I speak with your mother.

212
00:18:27,029 --> 00:18:31,228
- There's nothing wrong with me.
- It's just procedure. Then we'll speak.

213
00:18:31,309 --> 00:18:34,268
Can you take him to Medical, please?

214
00:18:34,869 --> 00:18:37,258
It's OK. I'll see you in a bit.

215
00:18:42,109 --> 00:18:45,260
- Don't worry. He'll be fine.
- Is Jack gonna be here soon?

216
00:18:45,349 --> 00:18:48,022
He's on his way in. Come with me.

217
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:53,501
I had no idea he worked in a place like this.

218
00:18:53,589 --> 00:18:56,103
It's just up these stairs.

219
00:18:56,189 --> 00:18:59,943
- Did you know him before?
- Yes.

220
00:19:00,029 --> 00:19:02,259
I knew him.

221
00:19:26,828 --> 00:19:29,059
A lot of people here thought you were dead.

222
00:19:29,148 --> 00:19:31,538
Yeah, I know. Excuse me.

223
00:19:33,308 --> 00:19:34,822
Chloe.

224
00:19:34,909 --> 00:19:37,706
- Hi, Jack.
- Are you all right?

225
00:19:37,789 --> 00:19:39,381
Yeah, I'm OK.

226
00:19:39,468 --> 00:19:42,904
We wouldn't have made it
out of that airport without you. Thank you.

227
00:19:42,989 --> 00:19:46,424
- You're welcome.
- Mr. Bauer. Lynn McGill from Division.

228
00:19:46,508 --> 00:19:50,137
I'll assume custody at this point, thank you.

229
00:19:50,228 --> 00:19:54,063
You're no longer a suspect
in Palmer's murder, but you will need this.

230
00:19:54,148 --> 00:19:56,059
- Level two clearance.
- Thank you.

231
00:19:56,149 --> 00:19:57,979
Did Manning apprehend the suspect?

232
00:19:58,068 --> 00:20:02,380
No. It seems the person you identified
used the hostage situation as a cover

233
00:20:02,469 --> 00:20:04,663
to steal a cache of nerve gas from the airport.

234
00:20:04,748 --> 00:20:06,898
Nerve gas? How do you know that?

235
00:20:06,988 --> 00:20:10,378
Curtis found trace amounts
in a hangar adjacent to the terminal.

236
00:20:10,468 --> 00:20:14,097
We don't know how much there is,
but it is a military-grade chemical weapon.

237
00:20:14,188 --> 00:20:17,180
- Any leads?
- We'll run the search operation.

238
00:20:17,268 --> 00:20:20,340
That's not gonna
track these terrorists fast enough.

239
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:25,183
The only way you're gonna get that gas is if
you find out who ordered the hit on Palmer.

240
00:20:25,267 --> 00:20:29,944
I agree. I think David Palmer was about to
expose this plot. That's why he was killed.

241
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:35,307
If you can help us identify who framed you,
we can intercept this while there's still time.

242
00:20:35,388 --> 00:20:37,742
- Hello, Jack.
- Hey, Bill.

243
00:20:37,828 --> 00:20:42,776
The president's been informed of the nerve
gas. He doesn't want the media to find out.

244
00:20:42,868 --> 00:20:48,544
I'll make sure Division restricts information
flow. We'll continue this when I'm done.

245
00:20:48,627 --> 00:20:52,984
- Good to see you again, Jack.
- It's good to see you, too, Bill.

246
00:20:53,068 --> 00:20:57,379
I'm so sorry about Michelle.
I never meant to put her in jeopardy.

247
00:20:57,468 --> 00:21:01,460
- Of course you didn't.
- How's Tony doing?

248
00:21:01,547 --> 00:21:06,098
He's still unconscious,
but the doctor says he's gonna pull through.

249
00:21:06,187 --> 00:21:08,906
Good. We need to speak to him
as soon as possible.

250
00:21:08,988 --> 00:21:11,182
They know to call us.

251
00:21:12,787 --> 00:21:15,859
Jack, Audrey has been working for us.

252
00:21:17,427 --> 00:21:21,500
- She's here in the building now?
- She's debriefing Diane Huxley.

253
00:21:21,587 --> 00:21:24,260
Why is she talking to Diane?

254
00:21:24,347 --> 00:21:26,781
Lynn asked her to.

255
00:21:28,387 --> 00:21:33,177
I'm not used to calling him Jack.
He said his name was Frank Flynn.

256
00:21:33,267 --> 00:21:38,294
I thought he worked for the oil company.
You probably know more about him than I do.

257
00:21:38,387 --> 00:21:43,096
- We all thought he was dead.
- So what do you want to know?

258
00:21:43,186 --> 00:21:46,815
Jack was living with you
for the last six months. Is that correct?

259
00:21:46,907 --> 00:21:49,501
He was renting a room.

260
00:21:50,507 --> 00:21:54,897
So you don't have
a personal relationship with him?

261
00:21:54,986 --> 00:21:57,899
- I'm not sure that's any of your business.
- I'm sorry, I...

262
00:21:57,986 --> 00:22:04,425
I need to know how close you and Jack were.
Whether he confided in you or not.

263
00:22:04,507 --> 00:22:07,179
Jack's a private person.

264
00:22:07,267 --> 00:22:12,420
I always knew he was keeping
something from me, I just never pushed it.

265
00:22:12,507 --> 00:22:16,135
I accepted him for who he was.

266
00:22:16,226 --> 00:22:20,299
Ms Raines, whoever he was before,

267
00:22:22,107 --> 00:22:25,416
doesn't change the way I feel about him.

268
00:22:25,506 --> 00:22:29,419
He was good to me.
He was good to my son.

269
00:22:30,426 --> 00:22:32,940
He meant a lot to us.

270
00:22:33,026 --> 00:22:34,903
He still does.

271
00:22:37,186 --> 00:22:39,142
I see.

272
00:22:40,946 --> 00:22:45,178
Did, um... did anyone ever come by
and ask about Jack?

273
00:22:45,266 --> 00:22:47,985
- What do you mean?
- Someone knew Jack was alive.

274
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:51,342
It's critical to our investigation
that we find out who that was.

275
00:22:51,426 --> 00:22:54,418
No. No one ever asked about him.

276
00:22:54,505 --> 00:22:57,464
No one ever came to see him.

277
00:23:17,185 --> 00:23:20,860
Can... can you excuse me
for a minute, please?

278
00:23:20,946 --> 00:23:22,742
Yeah.

279
00:23:24,825 --> 00:23:26,816
Jack.

280
00:23:34,625 --> 00:23:37,503
I don't even know where to begin.

281
00:23:39,625 --> 00:23:42,059
I couldn't tell you I was still alive.

282
00:23:42,145 --> 00:23:46,741
- Jack, you don't need to apol...
- I did it for your own protection.

283
00:23:47,825 --> 00:23:52,694
It's been hard for me thinking that you died
believing that I was angry at you,

284
00:23:52,784 --> 00:23:54,855
that I hated you.

285
00:23:54,945 --> 00:23:57,981
I wasn't able to forgive myself for that.

286
00:23:58,065 --> 00:24:02,343
You had every reason to hate me. I was
responsible for Paul's death. I lied to you.

287
00:24:02,425 --> 00:24:04,416
Jack.

288
00:24:05,824 --> 00:24:08,213
You made a hard decision.

289
00:24:13,345 --> 00:24:18,134
I never imagined...
I'd get another chance to tell you this.

290
00:24:20,944 --> 00:24:22,935
But I...

291
00:24:25,945 --> 00:24:31,302
I want you to know that I don't blame you
for what happened with Paul.

292
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:34,693
Thank you.

293
00:24:37,624 --> 00:24:39,296
Jack.

294
00:24:40,104 --> 00:24:43,414
There's so much I want to say to you.
It's not the right time...

295
00:24:43,505 --> 00:24:46,416
- Mr. McGill needs to see you.
I'll be right down.

296
00:24:46,504 --> 00:24:49,177
I should go.

297
00:25:02,024 --> 00:25:04,492
Evelyn. Is Mrs. Logan still asleep?

298
00:25:04,584 --> 00:25:07,417
Yes. She's finally getting some rest.

299
00:25:07,504 --> 00:25:11,291
Good. You should probably
start gathering some of her things.

300
00:25:11,383 --> 00:25:16,582
- I thought the president was staying.
- He is. But she'll be leaving today.

301
00:25:17,104 --> 00:25:19,334
Where is she going?

302
00:25:19,424 --> 00:25:23,655
Just make sure she has the essentials
to make her trip comfortable.

303
00:25:23,743 --> 00:25:25,860
Yes, sir.

304
00:25:49,744 --> 00:25:51,780
What are you doing?

305
00:25:51,863 --> 00:25:56,573
Setting up a new socket.
We're overloaded from the NSC database.

306
00:25:57,023 --> 00:25:59,173
- Why are you here?
- Looking for you.

307
00:25:59,263 --> 00:26:03,176
- What for?
- I need to get into your utilities volume.

308
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:08,898
- Why didn't you message me?
- I wanted to say something too. No drama.

309
00:26:08,983 --> 00:26:10,780
What?

310
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:17,421
I was unfairly harsh to you a few minutes ago.
I didn't mean anything.

311
00:26:18,503 --> 00:26:22,462
All right. Apology accepted.

312
00:26:22,543 --> 00:26:26,582
It wasn't really an apology,
it was more of an observation. The fact...

313
00:26:26,663 --> 00:26:28,381
Spenser.

314
00:26:31,023 --> 00:26:34,413
Dammit. Why do I do that?

315
00:27:00,342 --> 00:27:02,094
<i>- Stiles.
- It's Chloe.</i>

316
00:27:02,183 --> 00:27:05,219
- What is it?
- I need to know Spenser's clearance level.

317
00:27:05,302 --> 00:27:09,181
- Why you asking?
- Spenser works for me and I need to know.

318
00:27:09,262 --> 00:27:12,538
So you could please open the header file
and give it to me?

319
00:27:12,622 --> 00:27:14,658
Fine.

320
00:27:16,302 --> 00:27:18,372
Level three.

321
00:27:20,262 --> 00:27:22,651
<i>Chloe.</i>

322
00:27:22,742 --> 00:27:26,291
Call Buchanan. Tell him
I need to talk to him now. It's important.

323
00:27:30,542 --> 00:27:36,299
Division sent me. One of your
mainframe servers is cycling slow.

324
00:27:36,742 --> 00:27:39,176
- You're not here.
- I was told it'd be taken care of.

325
00:27:39,261 --> 00:27:44,097
I'm gonna have to clear this
with the systems administrator.

326
00:27:44,181 --> 00:27:46,537
- Are you Hank? From Outside Support?
- Yeah.

327
00:27:46,622 --> 00:27:50,011
My fault. I was supposed to advance him
an emergency clearance.

328
00:27:50,101 --> 00:27:55,972
All right. Place the bag on the conveyor belt.
Walk right through, sir.

329
00:28:12,581 --> 00:28:14,731
- All clear.
- Thank you.

330
00:28:14,821 --> 00:28:18,575
Thank you. I'll show you the way.

331
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:24,569
Mr. Cummings told me
it would be best to keep you off the manifest.

332
00:28:25,701 --> 00:28:28,579
Classified material
runs on servers nine and twelve.

333
00:28:28,661 --> 00:28:32,779
All the information you need on Bauer
should be there.

334
00:28:33,781 --> 00:28:36,454
I don't know
what Cummings asked you to download,

335
00:28:36,541 --> 00:28:41,490
but you need to keep vector counts the same,
or it'll get flagged.

336
00:28:44,141 --> 00:28:46,336
I got it.

337
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:50,614
OK. I need to get back to my station.

338
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:37,060
Evelyn, what are you doing?

339
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:39,973
Mrs. Logan, are you feeling better?

340
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:42,528
Why are you packing my things?

341
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,489
Walt Cummings asked me to.

342
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:49,413
Why? Where are we going?

343
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:53,652
I don't know
if the president's going with you.

344
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:56,334
Evelyn, stop. What's going on?

345
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:02,254
They just asked me to get you ready to leave.

346
00:30:06,819 --> 00:30:10,176
They're sending me to Vermont, aren't they?

347
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:14,495
Charles is having me committed.

348
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:19,449
I'm sorry, Mrs. Logan.
I honestly don't know anything else.

349
00:30:23,459 --> 00:30:25,256
Fine.

350
00:30:36,259 --> 00:30:38,455
I'll get dressed.

351
00:30:51,459 --> 00:30:54,769
Edgar. My FGA is locked. Where's Chloe?

352
00:30:54,859 --> 00:30:57,054
How should I know?

353
00:30:59,459 --> 00:31:01,653
- Can you unlock this?
- No.

354
00:31:03,299 --> 00:31:05,972
Mr. Wolff. Please come with us.

355
00:31:08,179 --> 00:31:11,808
- What do you want?
- Mr. Buchanan ordered us to take you to him.

356
00:31:11,899 --> 00:31:17,849
- I'm in the middle of a critical task here.
- Mr. Stiles will take over your workload.

357
00:31:17,939 --> 00:31:20,248
Did you know about this, Edgar?

358
00:31:20,338 --> 00:31:24,048
Yeah. I just got the bulletin. Sorry.

359
00:31:24,699 --> 00:31:26,893
Mr. Wolff. Please.

360
00:31:28,779 --> 00:31:30,655
I'm coming.

361
00:31:47,619 --> 00:31:50,132
Chloe? Sir. What is going on here?

362
00:31:50,219 --> 00:31:52,857
Sit down, Spenser.

363
00:32:00,298 --> 00:32:04,814
You've been burrowing into classified
CTU protocols without authorisation.

364
00:32:04,898 --> 00:32:09,688
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Stop. You logged on to the subsystem.

365
00:32:09,778 --> 00:32:12,770
We're going through your system.
Tell us what you were doing.

366
00:32:12,858 --> 00:32:17,010
- I told you I was opening a...
- That's enough!

367
00:32:17,098 --> 00:32:22,889
You've accessed files outside your clearance
level at least 18 times in four months.

368
00:32:23,818 --> 00:32:28,049
Sir, whatever you think you've found,
it's a mistake. I've done nothing wrong.

369
00:32:28,138 --> 00:32:31,766
- You obviously have your own agenda here.
- I don't have an agenda.

370
00:32:31,858 --> 00:32:34,530
Why don't you explain
why you had to crawl into my bed,

371
00:32:34,618 --> 00:32:39,976
which wasn't what it appeared to be, just like
your work here isn't what it appears to be?

372
00:32:42,897 --> 00:32:44,775
Let me handle this.

373
00:32:44,857 --> 00:32:48,453
Sir, you can't take anything she says
into consideration.

374
00:32:48,537 --> 00:32:53,292
I was careless, and inadvertently,
I caused her some emotional pain.

375
00:32:53,377 --> 00:32:57,006
- Oh, please.
- And now she's trying to get back at me.

376
00:32:57,097 --> 00:33:00,295
- I don't think so.
- Sir, I'd like to talk to a lawyer.

377
00:33:00,377 --> 00:33:05,371
Forget about a lawyer. We're in the middle of
a terrorist crisis. There are lives on the line.

378
00:33:05,457 --> 00:33:10,531
You're going to tell us what you've been
doing here, and you're going to tell us now.

379
00:33:15,857 --> 00:33:18,735
I hope this goes better than the last time.

380
00:33:18,817 --> 00:33:23,572
- Dr Hill and his staff are on stand-by.
- I'm not looking forward to this.

381
00:33:23,657 --> 00:33:25,375
- Evelyn.
- Mr. President.

382
00:33:25,457 --> 00:33:28,017
- Where is she?
- She's in the bathroom, sir.

383
00:33:31,857 --> 00:33:33,608
Martha!

384
00:33:36,057 --> 00:33:37,854
Marty!

385
00:33:40,217 --> 00:33:44,290
- Are you sure she's in there?
- Yes, sir. She's getting dressed.

386
00:33:46,176 --> 00:33:48,293
Marty.

387
00:34:08,897 --> 00:34:10,852
Aaron, my wife is gone.

388
00:34:10,937 --> 00:34:16,090
This is Pierce. We have a priority alert.
The first lady is unaccounted for.

389
00:34:16,176 --> 00:34:21,170
All agents, move north and west.
Anyone spotting her, check in immediately.

390
00:34:21,256 --> 00:34:23,053
<i>Got it.</i>

391
00:34:39,976 --> 00:34:44,094
So the only people who knew you were alive
were Palmer, Tony, Michelle and Chloe.

392
00:34:44,175 --> 00:34:47,690
And at least one other person
who killed Palmer and tried to frame me.

393
00:34:47,776 --> 00:34:50,654
- And you don't know who that might be?
- No.

394
00:34:50,735 --> 00:34:53,887
Any theories?

395
00:34:53,976 --> 00:34:59,004
David Palmer called me. Told me someone
in Logan's administration was targeting me.

396
00:34:59,096 --> 00:35:04,453
- Which is why you faked your own death.
- Yeah. Except it didn't work.

397
00:35:04,536 --> 00:35:09,166
I believe that whoever tried to kill me
18 months ago found out I was still alive,

398
00:35:09,255 --> 00:35:11,644
and waited until today to exploit that.

399
00:35:11,735 --> 00:35:14,886
Someone inside
President Logan's administration.

400
00:35:14,976 --> 00:35:18,012
That's what David Palmer told me then,
and I believe him.

401
00:35:18,095 --> 00:35:22,805
That means someone in this administration
is also tied to the theft of the nerve gas.

402
00:35:22,895 --> 00:35:25,967
Yeah. You're gonna have to look into that.

403
00:35:26,055 --> 00:35:28,728
There are hundreds of people
in the administration.

404
00:35:28,815 --> 00:35:32,808
It would take an investigation of that
magnitude months to gain any traction.

405
00:35:32,895 --> 00:35:36,205
<i>Mr. McGill,
Dr Paulson is calling from Medical.</i>

406
00:35:36,295 --> 00:35:38,126
<i>- Put him through.
- Mr. McGill.</i>

407
00:35:38,215 --> 00:35:42,652
<i>- Yes?
- Tony Almeida has regained consciousness.</i>

408
00:35:42,735 --> 00:35:46,410
<i>- Can he talk?
- Yes. He's very weak. You'll have to be brief.</i>

409
00:35:46,495 --> 00:35:50,454
<i>- I'll be down in a few minutes.
- Tony asked if he could speak to Jack Bauer.</i>

410
00:35:50,534 --> 00:35:52,924
<i>Says it's important.</i>

411
00:35:53,014 --> 00:35:55,164
He's a friend of mine.

412
00:35:55,255 --> 00:35:58,486
<i>- Jack will be down in a few moments.
- I'll let him know.</i>

413
00:35:58,575 --> 00:36:00,611
Thank you. I'll be right back.

414
00:36:08,615 --> 00:36:10,651
- Jack.
- What's going on?

415
00:36:10,734 --> 00:36:14,774
I know you're busy,
but... I just wanted to apologise.

416
00:36:14,854 --> 00:36:18,529
- You have nothing to apologise for.
- Yes, I do.

417
00:36:18,615 --> 00:36:23,893
I thought you were just another loser
trying to take advantage of my mom.

418
00:36:23,975 --> 00:36:26,090
I was wrong.

419
00:36:27,174 --> 00:36:32,407
You were trying to protect her. Your mother
is lucky that you love her so much.

420
00:36:32,934 --> 00:36:37,291
As soon as this is over, I promise you,
you and I are gonna get a chance to talk.

421
00:36:37,374 --> 00:36:40,411
- Right now, I have to go.
- Yeah.

422
00:36:42,254 --> 00:36:44,643
Take care of your mother.

423
00:36:49,494 --> 00:36:53,328
Who gave you the level five authorisation?

424
00:36:54,414 --> 00:36:57,645
- Don't look at me. Answer him!
- I can't.

425
00:36:57,734 --> 00:36:59,804
I can't talk to anyone here about this.

426
00:36:59,894 --> 00:37:03,170
Whatever you were doing is over, Spenser.

427
00:37:04,213 --> 00:37:07,330
I pulled Spenser's screen activity
from the archive.

428
00:37:07,414 --> 00:37:09,769
This is what he was looking at
ten minutes ago.

429
00:37:09,853 --> 00:37:14,689
Looks like he was using in-house surveillance
to track someone through CTU.

430
00:37:16,454 --> 00:37:18,569
Why are you tracking Jack Bauer?

431
00:37:18,654 --> 00:37:21,963
I'm sure if they're tracking Jack Bauer,
they have a reason.

432
00:37:22,053 --> 00:37:24,726
Who is "they"?

433
00:37:28,333 --> 00:37:30,289
I won't say anything else.

434
00:37:30,374 --> 00:37:34,924
Chloe, phone security.
Have them locate Jack now.

435
00:37:47,133 --> 00:37:48,805
- Dr Paulson?
- Yes.

436
00:37:48,894 --> 00:37:50,804
Jack Bauer for Tony Almeida.

437
00:37:50,893 --> 00:37:54,408
Oh, of course, Mr. Bauer.
Just remember to please keep it brief.

438
00:37:54,493 --> 00:37:56,484
Thank you, sir.

439
00:38:03,253 --> 00:38:05,289
Tony.

440
00:38:05,372 --> 00:38:07,250
Tony, it's Jack.

441
00:39:05,852 --> 00:39:08,810
Jack! Are you all right?

442
00:39:08,892 --> 00:39:10,928
I think he cracked my rib.

443
00:39:11,012 --> 00:39:14,368
The lines were locked out.
What happened? Who is he?

444
00:39:14,452 --> 00:39:18,001
He's a professional.
He killed Dr Paulson, and tried to kill me.

445
00:39:18,092 --> 00:39:22,722
- You have any idea how he got into CTU?
- We identified a mole in Chloe's department.

446
00:39:22,812 --> 00:39:26,521
- Who?
- Spenser Wolff. He hasn't talked yet.

447
00:39:26,612 --> 00:39:28,044
- Where is he?
- Holding.

448
00:39:28,132 --> 00:39:31,840
Get a doctor down here to monitor
Tony Almeida now. Lock this room down.

449
00:39:31,931 --> 00:39:34,764
Contact Lynn McGill.
Have him meet me at Holding.

450
00:39:52,852 --> 00:39:55,524
Bring up visual surveillance
on medical room two.

451
00:39:55,612 --> 00:39:58,523
Open the door.

452
00:40:04,532 --> 00:40:07,364
I want to show you something. Get up!

453
00:40:10,211 --> 00:40:15,365
Did you let that man into CTU? This man is
a professional assassin. He killed Dr Paulson.

454
00:40:15,451 --> 00:40:21,162
- Did you let him into CTU?!
- They said he was here to tap the server.

455
00:40:21,251 --> 00:40:22,570
Who?

456
00:40:22,651 --> 00:40:27,202
I was here as part of
an Internal Affairs investigation.

457
00:40:27,291 --> 00:40:30,920
Do you understand how much trouble
you are in? One more chance.

458
00:40:31,011 --> 00:40:34,083
Who told you to let that man into CTU?

459
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:39,443
The White House.
Mr. Cummings. The White House.

460
00:40:39,530 --> 00:40:41,840
Cummings recruited me.

461
00:40:41,931 --> 00:40:47,607
He said that they wanted to make sure
that CTU was operating within the rules.

462
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:53,083
You have to believe me.

463
00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:55,810
I thought I was serving the president.

464
00:40:57,851 --> 00:41:00,729
Yeah. Take him back to Holding.

465
00:41:06,251 --> 00:41:09,482
Walt Cummings killed David Palmer.
He tried to have me killed.

466
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:12,688
We have to build a case
before we call the president.

467
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:15,807
We don't call him - he's here in California.
We go see him now.

468
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:18,768
Cummings is the president's
chief of staff and friend.

469
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:23,083
- Without hard evidence, CTU can't touch him.
- I'm not CTU.

470
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:28,001
I'll go get Walt Cummings myself.
