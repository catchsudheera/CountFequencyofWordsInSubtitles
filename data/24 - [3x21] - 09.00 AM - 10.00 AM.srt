1
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,313
- What's going on?
- The operation wasn't completely successful.

2
00:00:17,443 --> 00:00:20,244
They have Saunders' daughter,
but didn't remain covert.

3
00:00:20,366 --> 00:00:22,484
- So Saunders knows we have her?
- Not yet.

4
00:00:22,608 --> 00:00:25,249
But CTU is estimating
he'll find out within the hour.

5
00:00:25,371 --> 00:00:28,171
The deadline for his next demand
is up in 15 minutes.

6
00:00:28,293 --> 00:00:32,370
Giving this guy a list of every foreign
operative on our payroll's an act of treason.

7
00:00:32,497 --> 00:00:35,970
I will not give in to Saunders' latest demand.

8
00:00:36,101 --> 00:00:38,492
We're out of time.
We need you to call your father.

9
00:00:38,623 --> 00:00:41,378
- And tell him what?
- Anything. Just keep him on the line.

10
00:00:43,227 --> 00:00:45,140
- Jane?
- Hi, Dad.

11
00:00:45,269 --> 00:00:48,184
<i>I told you only to use
this number in an emergency.</i>

12
00:00:48,312 --> 00:00:51,546
- Someone is monitoring the call.
- They've got her.

13
00:00:51,675 --> 00:00:55,911
<i>There's a man named Jack Bauer with you,
isn't there? Hand the phone to him.</i>

14
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:00,116
You know how many vials I have
and what I'm capable of.

15
00:01:00,243 --> 00:01:02,520
You know what I'm capable of, too.

16
00:01:09,411 --> 00:01:12,133
Stephen Saunders, this is Jack Bauer.

17
00:01:12,254 --> 00:01:17,049
You're completely surrounded. The president
has refused to capitulate to further demands.

18
00:01:17,179 --> 00:01:19,172
The only way you're getting out alive

19
00:01:19,301 --> 00:01:22,056
is through the front door
with your hands on your head.

20
00:01:22,143 --> 00:01:24,580
That's not exactly true, Jack.

21
00:01:24,706 --> 00:01:29,500
I'd like to offer you congratulations
on your wife eluding infection from the virus.

22
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:31,588
How do you know about my wife?

23
00:01:31,712 --> 00:01:37,075
<i>I did instruct them to leave her barely
functional so that we can return her to you.</i>

24
00:01:37,197 --> 00:01:40,556
There are five agents watching
the northeast exit of this building.

25
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,518
Send them to the front entrance. Michelle
will be dead if you don't do what I say.

26
00:01:44,644 --> 00:01:47,844
This is Tony Almeida.
Move everyone to the front now.

27
00:01:47,967 --> 00:01:51,440
In your car and move to the front
of the building. Down, down!

28
00:02:11,509 --> 00:02:18,387
Stephen Saunders, this is your final warning.
Come out of the building now.

29
00:02:31,007 --> 00:02:33,604
- Smoke him out.
- Release the tear gas.

30
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:35,688
We're a go.

31
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:48,140
- Send them in.
- Perimeter teams move in. Move in!

32
00:02:49,024 --> 00:02:52,656
- All right, boys. Let's go! Let's go!
- Move!

33
00:02:58,713 --> 00:03:01,708
- Baker!
- Move ahead.

34
00:03:03,357 --> 00:03:06,990
- Why aren't you covering the south?
- CTU said you needed us out front.

35
00:03:07,121 --> 00:03:12,245
- Why would they do that?
- They said Saunders was moving.

36
00:03:16,169 --> 00:03:18,970
Clear down there. Check the other room.

37
00:03:19,092 --> 00:03:21,973
All teams respond. Any sign of Saunders?

38
00:03:22,055 --> 00:03:25,573
- Apartment's clear!
- Jack, we're in. Still no sign of him.

39
00:03:25,698 --> 00:03:27,975
- Who gave you that order?
- Tony.

40
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,663
Move your team back to their mark now.

41
00:03:37,028 --> 00:03:41,470
- CTU. Almeida.
- Baker said you pulled him out of position.

42
00:03:41,593 --> 00:03:45,988
- I was working off the information I had.
- You should have cleared it with me.

43
00:03:46,117 --> 00:03:49,908
<i>- Somebody in my team made a mistake.
- That's an unacceptable mistake.</i>

44
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:54,835
I have tactical command in the field.
If you can't run CTU, get someone who can.

45
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:05,732
- Chase, check in.
- We've covered the building. He's not here.

46
00:04:09,178 --> 00:04:11,136
Dammit!

47
00:04:12,301 --> 00:04:16,583
- Saunders doesn't seem to be in the building.
- He's gotta be in there.

48
00:04:16,705 --> 00:04:19,905
What were you just telling Jack
about someone making a mistake?

49
00:04:20,028 --> 00:04:23,502
Never mind. Adam, are you sure
we tracked him to the right building?

50
00:04:23,632 --> 00:04:26,102
He was in there
when Jack made that phone call.

51
00:04:26,234 --> 00:04:29,547
- I'm pulling up the imagery now.
- I'll take care of that.

52
00:04:29,677 --> 00:04:33,310
You stay with Chloe and cover the site teams.

53
00:05:13,278 --> 00:05:14,234
Almeida.

54
00:05:14,359 --> 00:05:17,434
I hope you purged
the incriminating satellite frames.

55
00:05:17,562 --> 00:05:20,637
I did what you wanted me to.
Now, where's my wife?

56
00:05:20,725 --> 00:05:25,439
Not so fast. I like to do things in phases.
That was phase one.

57
00:05:25,569 --> 00:05:28,132
Next we have to talk about my daughter.

58
00:05:28,252 --> 00:05:30,893
- What about her?
- I want her back, of course.

59
00:05:31,014 --> 00:05:34,327
- Well, I want my wife back.
- Then there should be no problem.

60
00:05:34,457 --> 00:05:38,374
- Where's Jane now?
- She should be here in about five minutes.

61
00:05:38,501 --> 00:05:43,626
Good. Make sure the men who guard her
will follow your orders without question.

62
00:05:43,706 --> 00:05:46,507
<i>If any harm comes to my daughter,
your wife dies.</i>

63
00:05:46,629 --> 00:05:49,749
<i>If Jane is not released when I order it,
your wife dies.</i>

64
00:05:49,872 --> 00:05:54,347
<i>- That's all you need to know. Are we clear?
-  Tony, are you in there?</i>

65
00:05:54,476 --> 00:05:58,234
<i>-  President Palmer's on the line.
- I'll do my part. You do yours.</i>

66
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,799
<i>- That's the spirit.
-  Tony, are you there?</i>

67
00:06:01,883 --> 00:06:03,442
<i>- I'm here.
- Are you OK?</i>

68
00:06:03,565 --> 00:06:06,525
<i>- I'm fine. Put the president through.
- OK, hang on.</i>

69
00:06:06,647 --> 00:06:11,008
<i>- This is Tony Almeida.
- Please hold for the president.</i>

70
00:06:11,132 --> 00:06:14,605
Mr Almeida. I just heard
you lost Stephen Saunders. Is that true?

71
00:06:14,735 --> 00:06:19,574
- Yes, sir, unfortunately it is.
- I thought CTU was certain of his location.

72
00:06:19,699 --> 00:06:21,692
We're looking into it now, sir.

73
00:06:21,821 --> 00:06:25,101
- Does he know we're holding his daughter?
- Yes, sir, he does.

74
00:06:25,225 --> 00:06:27,536
And she's obviously very important to him.

75
00:06:27,667 --> 00:06:31,185
- Is Jane Saunders with you now?
- She's on her way here.

76
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:36,708
Mr Almeida, I don't have to remind you how
much security we're gonna need around her.

77
00:06:36,835 --> 00:06:40,798
She is the only thing between us
and Saunders controlling the government.

78
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:47,125
<i>- Yes, Mr President. We're aware of that.
- Good. Keep me posted.</i>

79
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,687
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

80
00:06:53,931 --> 00:06:56,892
<i> As yet, the Keeler campaign
has not issued a comment.</i>

81
00:06:57,014 --> 00:06:58,972
<i>We now go live with the senator.</i>

82
00:06:59,096 --> 00:07:04,129
<i>Senator Keeler, do you feel this is going to do
serious damage to your campaign?</i>

83
00:07:04,261 --> 00:07:07,415
<i>Absolutely not.
My record on labor speaks for itself.</i>

84
00:07:07,544 --> 00:07:11,666
<i>I voted against NAFTA and favored
tax incentives for domestic manufacturing.</i>

85
00:07:11,788 --> 00:07:13,940
<i>What about the other endorsements you lost?</i>

86
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:18,386
- Who did he lose?
- AFL, CIO and a couple of veteran groups.

87
00:07:18,514 --> 00:07:22,227
They don't like his negative spin
on your withdrawal from the debate.

88
00:07:22,318 --> 00:07:26,600
Now the threat level's been raised to red,
people realize he's the one playing politics.

89
00:07:26,722 --> 00:07:28,715
We can't waste time on the election.

90
00:07:28,844 --> 00:07:31,998
The only thing that matters
is stopping Stephen Saunders.

91
00:07:32,127 --> 00:07:34,962
Would you come with me, please?
Excuse us, Gerry.

92
00:07:35,089 --> 00:07:40,407
<i>We will be scheduling a press conference
shortly to address these issues. Thanks.</i>

93
00:07:43,978 --> 00:07:47,769
No, Adam, we found the room he was using.
I just wanna know how he got out.

94
00:07:47,901 --> 00:07:50,702
<i>- I'll call you when we get something.
- Good.</i>

95
00:07:50,824 --> 00:07:52,782
- What did he say?
- I don't understand.

96
00:07:52,906 --> 00:07:57,222
Saunders disappears and now CTU says
they're having problems with the satellite.

97
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:59,741
We'll look into it. Baker, this is Jack.

98
00:07:59,872 --> 00:08:03,835
- I want two teams on patrol, two on standby.
- What about us?

99
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:08,118
We're going to CTU. I wanna be with
Saunders' daughter when he calls us back.

100
00:08:20,972 --> 00:08:25,447
How did Saunders get past us? Could he
have access to our tracking systems?

101
00:08:25,576 --> 00:08:28,412
<i>- CTU. O'Brian.
- Chloe, what are you working on?</i>

102
00:08:28,539 --> 00:08:33,459
We're trying to pick up a thread on Saunders.
I'm analyzing his last call to you.

103
00:08:33,584 --> 00:08:37,182
Is it possible
that he was just routing his calls?

104
00:08:37,307 --> 00:08:42,944
No, he did that earlier at the apartment.
Now he couldn't do that without our knowing.

105
00:08:43,033 --> 00:08:45,754
Get back to me
as soon as you've got anything.

106
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:48,472
Something's not right here.

107
00:09:05,614 --> 00:09:07,811
- This is CTU?
- Yes.

108
00:09:07,936 --> 00:09:10,498
Your father and Chase are on their way back.

109
00:09:10,618 --> 00:09:13,009
- With Saunders?
- No.

110
00:09:13,141 --> 00:09:16,375
- Why not?
- They're still trying to locate him.

111
00:09:16,504 --> 00:09:18,622
- They haven't captured my father?
- No.

112
00:09:18,746 --> 00:09:22,982
- But he knows you guys have me, right?
- Yes, he does.

113
00:09:25,992 --> 00:09:28,555
- Agent Forrester, Tony Almeida.
- Tony.

114
00:09:28,635 --> 00:09:32,233
- We'll put Miss Saunders in a holding room.
- I was told a white room.

115
00:09:32,358 --> 00:09:36,196
That's changed. If you walk her to the back,
security will take her from there.

116
00:09:36,322 --> 00:09:38,884
You'll be fine, OK?

117
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:43,798
- How are you doing?
- I can't believe Saunders escaped.

118
00:09:43,929 --> 00:09:46,571
How could this happen?
I thought he was surrounded.

119
00:09:46,692 --> 00:09:51,690
It happened. Rae Plachecki's coming here to
talk to you about the shooting at the library.

120
00:09:51,816 --> 00:09:55,574
OK. Look, I heard the news about Michelle.

121
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,897
What news?

122
00:09:58,022 --> 00:10:02,497
- That she isn't infected.
- Oh. Yeah.

123
00:10:02,586 --> 00:10:05,023
I'm really glad that she's OK. That's great.

124
00:10:05,149 --> 00:10:07,107
Yeah. Thanks.

125
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:17,535
There's no way to be sure. Some people
don't show symptoms for five or six hours.

126
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:22,252
- Adam.
- Didn't they talk to you about your options?

127
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:28,694
<i> They said they could
give me a pill so I won't suffer.</i>

128
00:11:30,948 --> 00:11:33,385
- Adam, I need to talk to you now.
- Sarah, hold on.

129
00:11:33,511 --> 00:11:38,111
- I'm talking to my sister right now.
- The one who got infected with the virus?

130
00:11:38,235 --> 00:11:40,911
I'm not even gonna answer that, Chloe.

131
00:11:41,038 --> 00:11:43,873
I'm sorry. I'll just wait here until you're done.

132
00:11:44,001 --> 00:11:46,756
- Chloe.
- I'm sorry. This is really important.

133
00:11:46,883 --> 00:11:50,846
I just need you to finish up
as quickly as you can.

134
00:11:51,848 --> 00:11:55,560
Sarah, I'm gonna have to call you back
as soon as I can, OK?

135
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:59,365
<i>- I love you.
- I love you, too.</i>

136
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:05,294
Satellite navigation said there are missing
frames, and they're certain it's on our end.

137
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:09,344
- What about the backup?
- Gone, and they cover about 20 seconds.

138
00:12:09,379 --> 00:12:12,066
If Saunders did escape,
it was in that exact interval.

139
00:12:12,187 --> 00:12:16,389
- There was a glitch at the wrong moment?
- Yeah. What are the chances of that?

140
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:20,223
- Not good.
- So Saunders has access to our system.

141
00:12:20,354 --> 00:12:24,033
- Did you tell Tony yet?
- I want more information before I go to him.

142
00:12:24,158 --> 00:12:28,280
I checked with field ops. Their systems
are accounted for. Do the same in comm.

143
00:12:28,402 --> 00:12:31,363
You really think someone
inside CTU is working for Saunders?

144
00:12:31,485 --> 00:12:38,727
It's the only thing that makes sense, so do
that and then you could call your sister back.

145
00:12:55,227 --> 00:12:59,463
- Hey, Pete. I need a few minutes alone.
- Sure thing.

146
00:13:04,355 --> 00:13:05,915
How you doing?

147
00:13:06,037 --> 00:13:11,069
Why am I being treated
like I've done something wrong?

148
00:13:11,202 --> 00:13:15,563
I apologize for that.
We're just trying to keep you safe.

149
00:13:16,847 --> 00:13:22,802
This is the one place I'm not safe.
I've been thinking about it.

150
00:13:22,892 --> 00:13:25,455
You need me to get to my father.

151
00:13:25,575 --> 00:13:31,496
So threatening to kill me or harm me
is the only tool you have to use against him.

152
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:34,183
Tell me I'm wrong.

153
00:13:40,188 --> 00:13:45,631
You're right. We need your father
to believe we'll do anything to get him.

154
00:13:46,394 --> 00:13:50,676
But we're not gonna hurt you.
I give you my word.

155
00:13:51,559 --> 00:13:55,316
- Your word?
- Yeah, my word.

156
00:13:55,443 --> 00:13:59,598
I run this office
and I will personally protect you.

157
00:13:59,727 --> 00:14:04,441
What about Kim's father?
They told her that he's on his way back here.

158
00:14:04,531 --> 00:14:06,728
What about him?

159
00:14:06,853 --> 00:14:08,811
He scares me.

160
00:14:09,696 --> 00:14:12,576
I got the feeling he's willing to hurt me.

161
00:14:12,699 --> 00:14:16,900
Nobody's gonna hurt you. All right?

162
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:20,575
<i>I wish I could believe you.</i>

163
00:14:22,308 --> 00:14:24,619
- Almeida.
- Has Jane arrived?

164
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:27,627
- Yeah.
- Where is she?

165
00:14:28,513 --> 00:14:31,349
- She's here.
- Put her on.

166
00:14:31,476 --> 00:14:33,230
No. You have my wife.

167
00:14:33,358 --> 00:14:36,033
- I wanna talk to her first.
- You don't give me orders.

168
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,713
You're wrong. I have your daughter,
which means I'm in charge.

169
00:14:39,844 --> 00:14:44,399
If you so much as touch my wife,
I will slit Jane's throat.

170
00:14:47,411 --> 00:14:48,970
Hold on.

171
00:15:02,024 --> 00:15:05,303
Sorry for your discomfort.
Hopefully it's temporary.

172
00:15:05,428 --> 00:15:07,864
Uncuff her.

173
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:12,784
I'm going to let you speak to your husband.
Tell him you're OK and being treated well.

174
00:15:12,914 --> 00:15:15,989
Nothing more. Understood?

175
00:15:21,402 --> 00:15:23,999
- Tony, it's me.
- Michelle.

176
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:26,961
- He won't let me say much.
- Are you all right?

177
00:15:27,088 --> 00:15:30,970
I'm fine. I'm being treated well.

178
00:15:32,413 --> 00:15:34,370
Don't let them do this...

179
00:15:35,535 --> 00:15:36,890
Michelle?

180
00:15:37,698 --> 00:15:41,137
Let me speak with my daughter, Mr Almeida.

181
00:15:44,904 --> 00:15:48,263
It's your father. He wants to talk to you.

182
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:54,262
- Dad?
- Yes, Jane. It's me.

183
00:15:54,393 --> 00:15:57,034
They're saying horrible things about you.

184
00:15:57,156 --> 00:16:00,275
That's what they do. Don't believe any of it.

185
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:05,563
The virus in the hotel
that's killing all of those people...

186
00:16:05,598 --> 00:16:07,840
Please tell me that you didn't do that.

187
00:16:07,966 --> 00:16:12,919
Listen to me, Jane. The US government
distorts the truth and destroys lives.

188
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:16,363
Don't listen to any of it. It's all lies.

189
00:16:16,494 --> 00:16:19,329
Then you didn't do it?

190
00:16:19,456 --> 00:16:24,216
I'd never do something without good cause.
You know that. You know that.

191
00:16:24,341 --> 00:16:26,982
That's all. Let's do this.

192
00:16:27,103 --> 00:16:30,143
How long will it take for you
to get her out of the building?

193
00:16:30,266 --> 00:16:33,420
I have to fabricate some clearances.
About 30 to 40 minutes.

194
00:16:33,549 --> 00:16:38,753
Contact me as soon as you're clear of CTU.
Take down this number.

195
00:16:41,477 --> 00:16:44,357
Someone from Tony's group
purged the frames from the feed.

196
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,476
- Do you know who?
- It could have been from here or Division.

197
00:16:48,603 --> 00:16:51,484
I'd better tell Tony
so we can lock down the system.

198
00:16:53,608 --> 00:16:57,286
- CTU, O'Brian.
- This is Sunny Macer from Health Services.

199
00:16:57,412 --> 00:17:01,124
- What can I do for you?
- Have you heard from Michelle Dessler?

200
00:17:01,255 --> 00:17:03,373
No, she was sent to you for observation.

201
00:17:03,497 --> 00:17:07,015
That's why I'm calling. We got a message
that she asked to go to County.

202
00:17:07,141 --> 00:17:10,659
She's not at County and not here.
We can't get ahold of her.

203
00:17:10,784 --> 00:17:14,541
<i>- I'll check on it and get back to you.
- Thanks.</i>

204
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:20,542
<i>- Davis.
- Get me Mike Redmond. He's with Michelle.</i>

205
00:17:25,678 --> 00:17:29,230
<i>- He's not answering.
- He's active. He has to answer.</i>

206
00:17:29,361 --> 00:17:33,995
<i>- He's not answering.
- OK, I heard you the first time.</i>

207
00:17:34,126 --> 00:17:38,760
- And you're sure about this?
- Yes, Tony. Of course I'm sure.

208
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:43,331
There are 79 users, and one of them's been
playing games with the uplink recording.

209
00:17:43,454 --> 00:17:46,210
We're gonna have to
lock everything down, then.

210
00:17:46,337 --> 00:17:50,300
Well, obviously, I agree.
You want me to do it now?

211
00:17:50,421 --> 00:17:52,379
- Yeah.
- OK.

212
00:17:53,704 --> 00:17:56,938
- What is it?
- Something weird's happening with Michelle.

213
00:17:57,067 --> 00:18:01,303
- What do you mean?
- No one can find her or Redmond.

214
00:18:01,391 --> 00:18:05,547
That's because I overrode NHS's order.
I didn't want them to know about it.

215
00:18:05,675 --> 00:18:09,877
I'm putting Michelle in quarantine in one
of our substations so she can still work.

216
00:18:09,999 --> 00:18:13,278
- I need every warm body I can get.
- What am I gonna tell Macer?

217
00:18:13,402 --> 00:18:15,872
I'll call her.
There's something I want you to do.

218
00:18:16,004 --> 00:18:17,234
What is it?

219
00:18:17,366 --> 00:18:20,998
I'm sending you the record of a phone call
between Saunders and myself.

220
00:18:21,129 --> 00:18:23,600
- You spoke to him?
- Strip away the carrier signal.

221
00:18:23,732 --> 00:18:26,806
- See if you can use it to find him.
- What about the voice track?

222
00:18:26,935 --> 00:18:29,405
He scrambled it. It's useless.

223
00:18:29,537 --> 00:18:30,937
Fine.

224
00:18:31,058 --> 00:18:36,057
Chloe. Do it in tech one,
away from everybody.

225
00:18:36,183 --> 00:18:39,975
- I don't want Adam to know about it.
- Why not?

226
00:18:40,107 --> 00:18:43,739
Technically, it's his job, but you're better at it.

227
00:18:48,715 --> 00:18:52,267
- Why did you just say that?
- Because it's true.

228
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:19,541
You assured me that going on the offensive
against Palmer was the right thing to do.

229
00:19:19,664 --> 00:19:22,305
- Now it's backfired.
- Come on, John. That's not fair.

230
00:19:22,386 --> 00:19:26,429
Palmer leaves the debate after you brought
up the charge against his girlfriend.

231
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:30,182
Everyone assumed that the national security
excuse was just a cover.

232
00:19:30,313 --> 00:19:34,469
Apparently, it wasn't. The alert level's at red
and the airports are shut down.

233
00:19:34,597 --> 00:19:36,555
I know.

234
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,398
All right.

235
00:19:40,723 --> 00:19:44,767
Palmer still hasn't told the public
any of the details about this threat.

236
00:19:44,802 --> 00:19:47,603
Call Alex at the Pentagon
and see what you can find out.

237
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:52,250
Depending on what it turns out to be, I may
need to be proactive and issue an apology.

238
00:19:52,374 --> 00:19:55,653
<i>Yeah?</i>

239
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:59,056
<i>Sherry Palmer will be here in five minutes
to talk to the senator.</i>

240
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:02,653
<i>- What's this about?
- She says she has a high-value proposition.</i>

241
00:20:02,744 --> 00:20:04,781
All right, hold on.

242
00:20:04,906 --> 00:20:08,185
It's Sherry Palmer.
She wants to come here in five minutes.

243
00:20:08,309 --> 00:20:10,666
- Why?
- She wouldn't say.

244
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:16,473
Except that it's a high-value proposition
and she wants to present it face to face.

245
00:20:16,596 --> 00:20:19,159
Set it up.

246
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:22,240
All right. The senator will be here.

247
00:20:23,483 --> 00:20:26,238
This should be interesting.

248
00:20:30,449 --> 00:20:33,444
- I'll offload the systems.
- I'll be right up. Where's Tony?

249
00:20:33,572 --> 00:20:37,455
With Jane Saunders. Kim's waiting
to be debriefed and then working with NHS.

250
00:20:37,576 --> 00:20:41,458
- Why isn't she tracking Saunders?
- Tony put Chloe in charge of that.

251
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,293
- Where's Chloe?
- Tech one.

252
00:20:43,421 --> 00:20:46,496
- Why isn't she in field ops?
- You haven't talked to Tony yet?

253
00:20:46,664 --> 00:20:52,141
It looks like someone from Tony's group
intentionally wiped out those SAT frames.

254
00:20:52,229 --> 00:20:54,427
- That's how he was able to evade us.
- What?

255
00:20:54,552 --> 00:20:58,913
Adam, NHS wants those coordinates now
or they're going to widen the quarantine zone.

256
00:20:59,036 --> 00:21:01,347
OK. That's all I know. I gotta get back on this.

257
00:21:01,478 --> 00:21:03,436
OK, fine.

258
00:21:09,766 --> 00:21:12,487
- We may be moving you in a few minutes.
- Where?

259
00:21:12,608 --> 00:21:14,362
- To Division.
- What's that?

260
00:21:17,933 --> 00:21:19,687
<i>- Yeah.
- It's Jack.</i>

261
00:21:19,815 --> 00:21:23,128
<i>I need to speak with you.
Meet me outside the observation room.</i>

262
00:21:23,218 --> 00:21:25,781
I'll be right back.

263
00:21:33,388 --> 00:21:36,188
Jack. What the hell's going on?

264
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:39,464
You think someone on the inside's
working with Saunders?

265
00:21:39,593 --> 00:21:42,508
- I have Chloe working on it.
- What's she doing?

266
00:21:42,636 --> 00:21:45,312
She's taking a look at the status logs.

267
00:21:45,439 --> 00:21:48,593
If this is true, we've gotta get
spec ops down here immediately.

268
00:21:48,722 --> 00:21:51,603
I thought about that,
but I don't wanna raise any red flags.

269
00:21:51,725 --> 00:21:58,170
If someone is working with Saunders,
I don't want them to know we're onto them.

270
00:22:01,013 --> 00:22:02,971
OK, we'll work this up together,

271
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:07,052
but I want Division to pick up Jane Saunders
so they can continue questioning her.

272
00:22:07,179 --> 00:22:10,492
- Good idea.
- I'll call Brad Hammond. See you in tech one.

273
00:22:10,622 --> 00:22:15,097
No, Jack. I have a 30-minute status call
scheduled to Hammond anyway.

274
00:22:15,227 --> 00:22:19,223
Why don't you let me tell him?
You can go up to field ops.

275
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:21,308
OK, fine.

276
00:22:42,452 --> 00:22:47,736
Adam, is Tony set up for 30-minute
status calls with Brad Hammond?

277
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:54,180
If he is, it's not in the books.

278
00:22:54,303 --> 00:22:56,261
Thanks.

279
00:23:06,314 --> 00:23:07,873
Thank you very much.

280
00:23:07,996 --> 00:23:09,953
John, hello.

281
00:23:11,118 --> 00:23:14,751
Nice to see you. I don't believe you know
Mark Kaner, my campaign manager.

282
00:23:14,882 --> 00:23:17,603
- No, only by reputation.
- How do you do?

283
00:23:17,725 --> 00:23:23,168
- So what brings you here?
- Well, actually, it's a private matter, John.

284
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:26,808
Let us have a minute, Mark.

285
00:23:26,933 --> 00:23:28,891
No problem.

286
00:23:32,979 --> 00:23:34,937
Please.

287
00:23:35,061 --> 00:23:39,182
I heard about the endorsements
you lost this morning.

288
00:23:39,305 --> 00:23:44,258
- Daily fluctuation. Doesn't mean a thing.
- Doesn't mean a thing. Pretty optimistic.

289
00:23:44,389 --> 00:23:47,782
No, your campaign is imploding.

290
00:23:47,913 --> 00:23:51,989
By the time the press has a chance to analyse
all the mistakes you made last night,

291
00:23:52,116 --> 00:23:55,316
you'll look like a desperate candidate
gasping his last breath.

292
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:00,154
- If you just came here to insult me, I'm busy.
- No, John, on the contrary.

293
00:24:00,284 --> 00:24:02,242
Relax. I...

294
00:24:03,527 --> 00:24:08,481
I came here because I can guarantee you
a win in November.

295
00:24:10,974 --> 00:24:16,007
John, what I'm about to tell you, I will deny
to my grave if you try to hold it against me.

296
00:24:16,139 --> 00:24:19,339
So that's clear, right?

297
00:24:20,022 --> 00:24:22,983
John, we are clear on that, right?

298
00:24:27,269 --> 00:24:29,227
Good.

299
00:24:32,994 --> 00:24:36,547
David Palmer is an accessory to murder.

300
00:24:38,359 --> 00:24:40,830
- Whose murder?
- Alan Milliken.

301
00:24:40,962 --> 00:24:44,719
- Alan Milliken died of a heart attack.
- Yes, but he didn't have to.

302
00:24:44,805 --> 00:24:49,838
His nitroglycerin was just an arm's length
away, but someone kept it from him.

303
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:52,646
How could you possibly know that?

304
00:24:52,773 --> 00:24:55,734
Because that someone was me.

305
00:24:59,379 --> 00:25:02,100
Sherry, I think you had better leave right now.

306
00:25:02,222 --> 00:25:05,740
Really? So you can watch
your entire career leave with me?

307
00:25:05,865 --> 00:25:08,301
If it's true,
I don't want anything to do with you.

308
00:25:08,427 --> 00:25:13,062
Spare me. You haven't gotten this far without
getting a little dirt under your fingernails.

309
00:25:13,192 --> 00:25:15,992
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Of course not.

310
00:25:16,114 --> 00:25:19,952
But, for the sake of conversation,
just allow me to paint you a picture.

311
00:25:20,078 --> 00:25:24,314
Please. It won't take but a moment.
Just indulge me.

312
00:25:26,284 --> 00:25:28,242
Very well.

313
00:25:33,691 --> 00:25:37,927
David lied to the chief of police last night
in order to provide an alibi for me,

314
00:25:38,055 --> 00:25:40,287
and I can prove that he lied.

315
00:25:40,417 --> 00:25:42,569
No, you think about that.

316
00:25:42,699 --> 00:25:47,140
Proof that the president of the United States
lied to cover a murder.

317
00:25:47,263 --> 00:25:50,064
- What kind of proof?
- Besides my confession?

318
00:25:50,186 --> 00:25:53,625
I have the prescription bottle
he was reaching for. I was holding it.

319
00:25:53,749 --> 00:25:56,710
And I have it in a very safe place.

320
00:25:59,475 --> 00:26:02,709
You are talking about incriminating yourself.

321
00:26:02,798 --> 00:26:06,157
- You would go to prison.
- Yes, I know that.

322
00:26:06,281 --> 00:26:12,077
But so would David.
David lied to the police to save himself.

323
00:26:12,207 --> 00:26:14,278
It's quite simple, John.

324
00:26:14,409 --> 00:26:16,527
All you have to do is go to David

325
00:26:16,651 --> 00:26:20,442
and tell him that you have
this medicine bottle with my fingerprints on it

326
00:26:20,574 --> 00:26:24,287
and, I guarantee you,
David will drop out of the race,

327
00:26:24,418 --> 00:26:26,809
the party will be thrown into turmoil

328
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:32,383
and nobody, I mean nobody,
will be able to touch you come November.

329
00:26:39,432 --> 00:26:41,994
And for all of this?

330
00:26:43,275 --> 00:26:47,033
You'll put me on the White House staff.

331
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:51,320
Nothing so high
that it'll raise too many eyebrows, but...

332
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:57,080
All of this for you to be to a mid-level staffer
in my administration?

333
00:27:06,057 --> 00:27:10,816
You and I both know
that it would be a little more than that.

334
00:27:24,273 --> 00:27:27,029
<i>It's been revised
now the exposure range has changed.</i>

335
00:27:27,156 --> 00:27:30,435
So the casualty estimates
have been projected upward?

336
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:33,201
<i>- Yes, sir. I'm afraid so.
- By a factor of how many?</i>

337
00:27:33,322 --> 00:27:39,004
<i>Now the virus is not completely contained,
it could be as high as times five, sir.</i>

338
00:27:41,329 --> 00:27:44,642
<i>- All right, thanks, Dan. Keep me posted.
- Yes, sir.</i>

339
00:27:44,772 --> 00:27:49,567
- What is it?
- I just spoke to my source at Keeler's office.

340
00:27:49,697 --> 00:27:53,853
Sherry was there,
meeting privately with Keeler.

341
00:27:54,822 --> 00:27:57,384
- When?
- Just now.

342
00:28:01,068 --> 00:28:05,144
- Meeting Keeler about what?
- He didn't know, David.

343
00:28:05,231 --> 00:28:08,192
So I was hoping you'd have some idea.

344
00:28:09,636 --> 00:28:12,596
I don't know what she's doing,
but we can't worry about that.

345
00:28:12,718 --> 00:28:18,196
- There are people dying here in Los Angeles.
- Yeah, well, I don't like it, David.

346
00:28:18,324 --> 00:28:20,920
So let me put someone on this.

347
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:23,362
No.

348
00:28:24,529 --> 00:28:29,972
I brought Sherry in to fix a problem
and look what happened.

349
00:28:30,095 --> 00:28:33,886
Just let it be. We'll hear soon enough.

350
00:28:39,984 --> 00:28:41,942
What do you see?

351
00:28:42,026 --> 00:28:45,658
They're trying to use the open
phone switches to find us.

352
00:28:45,789 --> 00:28:48,180
The phone I called in with is shut off.

353
00:28:48,311 --> 00:28:51,751
They can't triangulate me, can they?

354
00:28:51,915 --> 00:28:57,836
Not quickly, but they can use a trial-and-error
process and that could get 'em close.

355
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:02,076
- Then that's what they're doing.
- It looks like it.

356
00:29:02,204 --> 00:29:04,767
Then we have to stop them.

357
00:29:04,887 --> 00:29:07,449
Come with me.

358
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:33,466
Your office is using
our last phone conversation to locate us.

359
00:29:33,593 --> 00:29:38,718
How are they doing it?
I'm committed to getting my daughter back.

360
00:29:38,838 --> 00:29:41,753
You kill me and that'll never happen.

361
00:29:41,881 --> 00:29:44,842
That's not the only option.

362
00:29:47,647 --> 00:29:51,006
You're an attractive woman.

363
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:57,085
I'm guessing your husband would prefer
you returned without disfigurement.

364
00:29:57,215 --> 00:30:00,176
I'm not telling you anything.

365
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:05,298
I have to talk with Almeida.

366
00:30:08,146 --> 00:30:11,106
Keep the conversation short.

367
00:30:12,269 --> 00:30:14,068
<i>Almeida.</i>

368
00:30:14,191 --> 00:30:16,149
<i>Let me paint you a picture.</i>

369
00:30:16,273 --> 00:30:20,793
I have a sharp knife, the tip of which
is drawing blood from your wife's face...

370
00:30:20,917 --> 00:30:22,875
right now.

371
00:30:22,999 --> 00:30:26,712
If whatever you're doing to trace
these calls doesn't stop in 30 seconds,

372
00:30:26,843 --> 00:30:29,883
she'll be unrecognizable.

373
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:47,857
<i>- O'Brian.
- Shut down the trace.</i>

374
00:30:47,983 --> 00:30:51,661
- I'm just starting to get something.
- Do it now, Chloe.

375
00:30:51,786 --> 00:30:54,018
Let me at least unscramble the audio.

376
00:30:54,148 --> 00:30:59,273
- I need you to hold off for a few minutes.
- I thought you wanted me to find Saunders.

377
00:30:59,393 --> 00:31:02,354
I do. Just... I'll explain it to you later.

378
00:31:02,996 --> 00:31:05,354
- What are you doing?
- Trying to pick up a thread.

379
00:31:05,479 --> 00:31:09,191
Somebody may be working against us.
I have quarantine zones springing up.

380
00:31:09,322 --> 00:31:12,203
I'm treading water here, Jack.

381
00:31:12,325 --> 00:31:15,161
Why are you lying to me?

382
00:31:15,288 --> 00:31:18,009
- Lying?
- I just got off the phone with Hammond.

383
00:31:18,131 --> 00:31:21,604
You didn't have a status call scheduled.

384
00:31:21,694 --> 00:31:26,567
I screwed up earlier. The SAT transmission
on my system was forged by own people.

385
00:31:26,698 --> 00:31:30,661
I should have noticed it wasn't authentic
before I ordered Baker off his post.

386
00:31:30,782 --> 00:31:33,857
By the time I realized my mistake,
Saunders was gone.

387
00:31:33,985 --> 00:31:38,460
- What about the missing frames?
- Must have been deleted by the same person.

388
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:43,384
I know this is big and, I promise you,
I'll offer my resignation when this day is over.

389
00:31:43,514 --> 00:31:45,746
Right now we got too much going on.

390
00:31:45,876 --> 00:31:48,632
Making a mistake is one thing.
Covering it up is another.

391
00:31:48,759 --> 00:31:51,799
I can't let you stay in place.
I am taking over command of CTU.

392
00:31:51,922 --> 00:31:54,643
- I made a mistake, Jack.
- No, Tony.

393
00:31:54,765 --> 00:31:57,327
You made two.

394
00:31:59,249 --> 00:32:04,533
Fine. I'll make sure Adam sends over
everything I got to your group.

395
00:32:26,394 --> 00:32:28,956
Tony, I narrowed down the list.

396
00:32:30,157 --> 00:32:31,353
What list?

397
00:32:31,479 --> 00:32:35,920
Of people who can't account for their time
when the SAT frames went missing.

398
00:32:36,043 --> 00:32:37,363
Yeah, right.

399
00:32:37,484 --> 00:32:42,438
It's very likely that someone on this list
is working from within CTU to help Saunders.

400
00:32:42,529 --> 00:32:45,888
Look, Adam, I'm not in charge
of CTU any more.

401
00:32:47,133 --> 00:32:51,494
- What are you talking about?
- Jack decided it was best if he took over.

402
00:32:51,617 --> 00:32:55,250
Why don't you send that list
over to Hammond?

403
00:33:12,357 --> 00:33:13,916
<i> Yes?</i>

404
00:33:14,038 --> 00:33:16,429
<i>- I got a problem.
- What problem?</i>

405
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,918
Jack Bauer just relieved me of my command.

406
00:33:19,043 --> 00:33:23,279
<i>- Why did he do that?
- He found out I deleted those satellite frames.</i>

407
00:33:23,367 --> 00:33:26,247
- Does he know about our communication?
- Not yet.

408
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:29,570
He thinks I'm covering my mistake,
but he's gonna find out soon.

409
00:33:29,693 --> 00:33:32,768
Then I suggest you get my daughter
out of there before he does.

410
00:33:32,896 --> 00:33:36,892
Look, I might not be able to do this.
I no longer have any authority at CTU.

411
00:33:37,019 --> 00:33:40,857
You don't need authority. You just need
to know that if you don't deliver Jane,

412
00:33:40,983 --> 00:33:44,821
for whatever reason, your wife will die,
just like Ryan Chappelle died,

413
00:33:44,947 --> 00:33:48,340
<i>just like the people
at the Chandler Plaza Hotel died.</i>

414
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:54,910
<i>- I'm gonna try to get her out, but if I can't...
- If you can't, Michelle dies.</i>

415
00:33:54,996 --> 00:33:58,071
Don't call me again
until you have Jane safely away.

416
00:34:17,617 --> 00:34:20,008
- Dad.
- I need you to help me with something.

417
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:24,501
Tony wants me to debrief with Rae Plachecki
about what's going on with Jane Saunders.

418
00:34:24,624 --> 00:34:29,144
Tony just stepped down.
I'm acting director of CTU until further notice.

419
00:34:29,268 --> 00:34:32,263
What do you mean, Tony stepped down?

420
00:34:32,391 --> 00:34:35,784
Tony's hiding something.
I need you to help me find out what it is.

421
00:34:35,914 --> 00:34:38,556
- Why me?
- Right now I don't know who to trust.

422
00:34:38,677 --> 00:34:42,879
Maintain surveillance on every station
here at CTU, anyone who checks in or out,

423
00:34:42,961 --> 00:34:46,240
and track communications
flagged higher than a code two.

424
00:34:46,364 --> 00:34:49,677
- Where do you want me to do this?
- Field ops. Come on.

425
00:34:49,807 --> 00:34:51,720
Thanks.

426
00:35:05,341 --> 00:35:06,297
Almeida.

427
00:35:06,422 --> 00:35:08,460
- Good news, Tony.
- What is it?

428
00:35:08,584 --> 00:35:12,581
I found a way to pull the voice track
on the phone call you had with Saunders.

429
00:35:12,708 --> 00:35:15,350
- Have you listened to it?
- The algorithm's running.

430
00:35:15,471 --> 00:35:20,504
Once that's complete, I'll be able to do
an analysis on ambient sound and room tone.

431
00:35:20,636 --> 00:35:23,198
Good work.

432
00:35:42,496 --> 00:35:45,217
<i> Adam, send your volumes
to Kim's computer.</i>

433
00:35:45,339 --> 00:35:47,376
I have her checking something for me.

434
00:35:47,501 --> 00:35:50,415
- Is Chloe still in tech one?
- As far as I know, she is.

435
00:35:50,543 --> 00:35:53,983
- Have her come up to my office.
- I will, Jack.

436
00:36:00,433 --> 00:36:02,869
- Kaufman.
- I'm on the line with Chloe.

437
00:36:02,955 --> 00:36:05,711
- We need the password to 824.
- OK.

438
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:11,235
- It's BCF19.
- All right, thanks.

439
00:36:11,363 --> 00:36:14,084
Jack needs to see Chloe
in his office right away.

440
00:36:14,205 --> 00:36:16,768
- I'll tell her.
- Thank you.

441
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:32,456
<i>-  Where is she?
-  She's here.</i>

442
00:36:32,582 --> 00:36:35,657
<i>- Put her on.
- No. You have my wife.</i>

443
00:36:35,785 --> 00:36:38,348
<i>I wanna talk to her first.</i>

444
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:42,951
<i>You have my wife. I wanna talk to her first.</i>

445
00:36:43,032 --> 00:36:46,107
"You have my wife"?

446
00:36:48,237 --> 00:36:51,312
Hello? Hello?

447
00:36:53,202 --> 00:36:55,159
Dammit.

448
00:37:06,374 --> 00:37:09,174
Help! Somebody help! I'm locked in!

449
00:37:09,297 --> 00:37:12,097
Tech one! I'm locked in!

450
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:32,188
Everybody, can I have your attention?

451
00:37:32,318 --> 00:37:35,996
Just stop working for a second.
I need your attention.

452
00:37:36,121 --> 00:37:38,922
From this point forward,
I am taking command of CTU.

453
00:37:39,044 --> 00:37:41,435
That includes field ops
and all communications.

454
00:37:41,567 --> 00:37:45,006
Tony Almeida has stepped down.
He is no longer in charge.

455
00:37:48,253 --> 00:37:51,167
I'm taking Jane Saunders to Division.
Here's the order.

456
00:37:51,296 --> 00:37:54,974
I don't have time to go into details.
We have to focus on finding Saunders.

457
00:37:55,099 --> 00:37:58,651
Come on, Pete.
Call Division. Talk to 'em yourself.

458
00:37:58,782 --> 00:38:03,622
Unless you are working directly with NHS,
I need you to get involved.

459
00:38:08,592 --> 00:38:14,832
Your superiors will hand out your
assignments. We need to find this guy now.

460
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:26,479
We're leaving right now.
We're going out this way right here.

461
00:38:34,536 --> 00:38:39,375
Chloe hasn't refreshed her chron tables.
I thought she was on the main system.

462
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:42,063
Yeah, she was.

463
00:38:42,823 --> 00:38:47,218
- That's weird. She never forgets to do that.
- What's going on?

464
00:38:47,348 --> 00:38:49,545
- Have you seen Chloe?
- She's in tech one.

465
00:38:50,791 --> 00:38:53,786
- Where are all the guards?
- We don't need those guards.

466
00:38:53,914 --> 00:38:56,669
You were worried
about my father sending men to get me.

467
00:38:56,796 --> 00:39:01,032
We have agents on the streets.
Don't worry about it.

468
00:39:05,925 --> 00:39:08,965
- Why can't I get a feed on tech one?
- Hang on.

469
00:39:10,689 --> 00:39:13,490
- Someone blocked it.
- We have a hostile inside.

470
00:39:13,612 --> 00:39:17,210
- Override the access code now.
- Security, I need a 20 on Chloe O'Brian.

471
00:39:17,335 --> 00:39:20,888
Priority-one sweep of the entire building.

472
00:39:27,024 --> 00:39:29,587
Cover the back entrance.

473
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:36,663
- Jack.
- Step away from the computer. Now!

474
00:39:36,834 --> 00:39:41,115
Tony locked me in here. Saunders has
Michelle. He's using her to get his daughter.

475
00:39:41,198 --> 00:39:44,078
Don't move.

476
00:39:45,482 --> 00:39:49,524
Security, this is Jack Bauer.
I need a 20 on Tony Almeida.

477
00:39:49,645 --> 00:39:53,244
I repeat, I need a 20 on Tony Almeida.

478
00:39:53,369 --> 00:39:56,044
<i>Negative, Jack.
He's not on any of the monitors.</i>

479
00:39:56,171 --> 00:40:00,009
- When did he lock you in here?
- About 10 minutes ago.

480
00:40:06,341 --> 00:40:12,023
Lock down the entire building. Adam, I wanna
know everything that's exiting this building.

481
00:40:12,146 --> 00:40:17,703
- Who's watching Jane Saunders?
- Both guards are down. She's gone.

482
00:40:24,398 --> 00:40:27,437
Exit security, I need a 20 on Tony Almeida.

483
00:40:33,686 --> 00:40:35,883
This is Almeida. We're out. I've got her.

484
00:40:36,008 --> 00:40:38,969
<i>- How long until satellite finds you?
- About 30 minutes.</i>

485
00:40:39,091 --> 00:40:41,892
I'll give you further instructions
in 20 minutes.

486
00:40:42,014 --> 00:40:44,975
Be at the northeast corner of Taylor and Vine.

487
00:40:46,018 --> 00:40:48,375
Yeah, all right.

488
00:40:57,068 --> 00:40:59,790
<i>- Yes, sir.
- Put me on to Palmer.</i>

489
00:40:59,911 --> 00:41:03,509
I'd like to speak to him. Personally.

490
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,754
Son of a bitch.
