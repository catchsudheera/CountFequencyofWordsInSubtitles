00:00:12,834 --> 00:00:14,968
Our security police have
completed their initial sweep

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,233
of the capital city.

4
00:00:16,234 --> 00:00:18,132
65 known members of the
opposition have been arrested

5
00:00:18,133 --> 00:00:19,566
and are being
questioned.

6
00:00:19,567 --> 00:00:20,633
Have you learned anything?

7
00:00:20,634 --> 00:00:21,633
Were any of them

8
00:00:21,634 --> 00:00:22,733
working with my brother?

9
00:00:22,734 --> 00:00:23,833
It's too early to tell.

10
00:00:23,834 --> 00:00:25,934
Kayla, your father
is a great man,

11
00:00:25,968 --> 00:00:28,200
but Farhad's betrayal
has changed him.

12
00:00:28,234 --> 00:00:30,134
What can we do?

13
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,066
The president says

14
00:00:32,067 --> 00:00:33,466
you may be involved
with his brother.

15
00:00:33,467 --> 00:00:34,733
He's ordered me
to detain you.

16
00:00:34,734 --> 00:00:37,100
I'll talk to him.

17
00:00:37,133 --> 00:00:39,501
President Hassan's
crackdown

18
00:00:39,534 --> 00:00:42,868
isn't just a response
to the attempt on his life.

19
00:00:42,901 --> 00:00:45,801
There are unsecured
nuclear materials in play.

20
00:00:45,834 --> 00:00:47,734
CTU is running
an undercover operation

21
00:00:47,734 --> 00:00:49,767
to retrieve them as we speak.

22
00:00:49,801 --> 00:00:51,166
I've got something.

23
00:00:51,167 --> 00:00:54,100
It's an NYPD evidence lockup.

24
00:00:54,133 --> 00:00:55,600
A local vice group

25
00:00:55,601 --> 00:00:57,501
just impounded
$120,000.

26
00:00:57,534 --> 00:01:00,467
I help you do this and
you never call me again.

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,234
That's beautiful, man.
Absolutely beautiful.

28
00:01:05,267 --> 00:01:06,433
It's a cop.

29
00:01:06,434 --> 00:01:08,367
You're going to have
to slip past him.

30
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,801
I'm at the warehouse...
Nick!

31
00:01:10,834 --> 00:01:12,399
Kevin, stop him!

32
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,334
I hear there are materials

33
00:01:14,367 --> 00:01:15,833
for sale.

34
00:01:15,834 --> 00:01:16,833
Talk straight.

35
00:01:16,834 --> 00:01:17,833
What materials?

36
00:01:17,834 --> 00:01:19,266
Nuclear rods.

37
00:01:19,267 --> 00:01:21,467
Nobody deals
in nuclear rods, nobody.

38
00:01:21,501 --> 00:01:22,666
We have a problem.

39
00:01:22,667 --> 00:01:24,868
Vladimir Laitanan knows
about the fuel rods.

40
00:01:24,901 --> 00:01:26,299
Come on, Vladimir,
push them harder.

41
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:28,267
Somebody knows something.

42
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,334
No one knows,
there's no one left to call.

43
00:01:30,367 --> 00:01:31,366
Look, it's over!

44
00:01:31,367 --> 00:01:33,267
What is wrong
with you?!

45
00:01:38,701 --> 00:01:39,700
Renee.

46
00:01:39,701 --> 00:01:41,566
Stop, stop.

47
00:01:41,567 --> 00:01:43,433
They're Russian.
What are you doing?

48
00:01:43,434 --> 00:01:45,166
I need to let them take me.

49
00:01:45,167 --> 00:01:47,434
When CTU gets here, you tell them
to start tracking me from the air.

50
00:01:47,467 --> 00:01:49,534
These people are gonna lead us
to everything we're looking for.

51
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:51,467
I'm unarmed, don't shoot.

52
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,767
We can do business.

53
00:01:54,801 --> 00:01:55,800
Where's Jack?

54
00:01:55,801 --> 00:01:57,566
The Russians took him.

55
00:01:57,567 --> 00:01:59,634
He said that you'd be
monitoring him from the air.

56
00:01:59,667 --> 00:02:00,666
We haven't seen anything.

57
00:02:00,667 --> 00:02:02,567
Where is he?

58
00:02:25,133 --> 00:02:26,199
Yeah?

59
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,299
Where the hell are you?

60
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,200
Hey, Jenny girl!
You said you would call me

61
00:02:29,234 --> 00:02:31,134
as soon as the two of you
got clear.

62
00:02:31,167 --> 00:02:33,100
I'm sorry, sweetheart,
I forgot.

63
00:02:33,133 --> 00:02:34,800
We-we got- hold on-
we got caught up

64
00:02:34,801 --> 00:02:36,701
celebrating our score.

65
00:02:36,701 --> 00:02:37,833
Celebrating?

66
00:02:37,834 --> 00:02:40,234
You put a police officer
in the hospital.

67
00:02:40,267 --> 00:02:42,467
Hey, that wasn't
me, that was Nick.

68
00:02:42,501 --> 00:02:45,133
A- And look, why do, why do you
got to focus on the negative?

69
00:02:45,167 --> 00:02:48,501
We're flush 120 grand.

70
00:02:48,534 --> 00:02:50,233
Why don't you just
come down here,

71
00:02:50,234 --> 00:02:52,032
have a drink,
celebrate with us?

72
00:02:52,033 --> 00:02:55,033
We're at a club in Jersey
City called Starlight.

73
00:02:55,067 --> 00:02:56,466
We'll work
out your cut.

74
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:57,700
What cut?

75
00:02:57,701 --> 00:02:59,366
I don't want anything from you,
Kevin.

76
00:02:59,367 --> 00:03:00,999
We're done.

77
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,800
I want you
to put my key

78
00:03:02,801 --> 00:03:05,167
in my mailbox
and get the hell out of my life

79
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,100
like you promised.

80
00:03:09,467 --> 00:03:12,334
Yeah, that-that's not going
to happen.

81
00:03:12,367 --> 00:03:14,934
What does that mean?

82
00:03:14,968 --> 00:03:17,334
This is a sweet operation that
we got going here, you know?

83
00:03:17,367 --> 00:03:18,366
You getting the access codes

84
00:03:18,367 --> 00:03:21,400
and-and us
pulling the jobs.

85
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:23,032
W- W-Wait...

86
00:03:23,033 --> 00:03:25,133
We had a deal, Kevin.

87
00:03:25,167 --> 00:03:27,501
You promised me
I do this one thing for you

88
00:03:27,534 --> 00:03:28,999
and then you leave me alone.

89
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,033
I- I know and I, and I, and
I meant that, all right,

90
00:03:33,067 --> 00:03:36,801
but things change,
okay, an-an-and...

91
00:03:36,834 --> 00:03:38,734
We can get rich
off of this, Jenny.

92
00:03:38,734 --> 00:03:40,667
You can't do this
to me, Kevin.

93
00:03:41,701 --> 00:03:44,033
Jenny, please...

94
00:03:44,067 --> 00:03:45,833
Look, bitch,

95
00:03:45,834 --> 00:03:47,500
you're in this
up to your neck.

96
00:03:47,501 --> 00:03:49,834
You want your boss and want
your boyfriend finding out

97
00:03:49,868 --> 00:03:52,200
you're not who
you say you are?

98
00:03:52,234 --> 00:03:55,033
You're gonna be our
golden goose, okay?

99
00:04:01,267 --> 00:04:03,234
Hello?
Dana.

100
00:04:04,267 --> 00:04:05,333
What are you doing?

101
00:04:05,334 --> 00:04:06,766
We got a situation;
you need to be

102
00:04:06,767 --> 00:04:08,667
on the floor.

103
00:04:08,667 --> 00:04:10,032
Dana...

104
00:04:10,033 --> 00:04:12,200
I heard you, I will
be right there.

105
00:04:12,234 --> 00:04:13,933
Who was that
on the phone just now?

106
00:04:13,934 --> 00:04:14,967
That's none of your business.

107
00:04:14,968 --> 00:04:15,967
Actually, it is.

108
00:04:15,968 --> 00:04:16,967
When you start
sneaking away

109
00:04:16,968 --> 00:04:19,367
to make phone calls
or leave the office,

110
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,733
making me cover for you,

111
00:04:20,734 --> 00:04:22,634
it becomes my business.

112
00:04:22,667 --> 00:04:23,800
Now, who was that?

113
00:04:23,801 --> 00:04:24,867
Kevin?

114
00:04:24,868 --> 00:04:27,834
How the hell would you...?

115
00:04:27,868 --> 00:04:29,566
Are you spying on me?

116
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:31,534
Look, you want to step out
on your fiancé,

117
00:04:31,567 --> 00:04:32,600
it's fine with me.

118
00:04:32,601 --> 00:04:34,199
God knows I've got
no love for the guy.

119
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,766
You have no idea what
you are talking about.

120
00:04:35,767 --> 00:04:36,867
I am not cheating
on Cole.

121
00:04:36,868 --> 00:04:39,167
Okay, whatever you
want to call it,

122
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,567
you'd better start telling
your boyfriend what's going on

123
00:04:42,601 --> 00:04:43,800
or I will.

124
00:04:43,801 --> 00:04:45,266
Now, come on.

125
00:04:45,267 --> 00:04:48,234
Our undercover operation
just went south.

126
00:04:48,267 --> 00:04:49,999
What's happened?

127
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,999
Jack Bauer was grabbed

128
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,267
by an unknown group
of armed Russians.

129
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,701
We think they're the ones
in control of the nuclear rods.

130
00:04:55,734 --> 00:04:56,766
Are we tracking them?

131
00:04:56,767 --> 00:04:59,033
We can't.

132
00:04:59,067 --> 00:05:00,633
They took Bauer
through an underground access

133
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:01,666
behind the building.

134
00:05:01,667 --> 00:05:02,800
Without aerial support, the best

135
00:05:02,801 --> 00:05:04,032
my people could do
was track them

136
00:05:04,033 --> 00:05:06,767
to a drainage junction
near Avenue Y and Ocean.

137
00:05:06,801 --> 00:05:08,433
They must have had a
vehicle standing by.

138
00:05:08,434 --> 00:05:09,933
Jack's cell phone was
trashed at the scene.

139
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:11,299
Well, there has to be
something at the site

140
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,867
to help us I.D.
the vehicle.

141
00:05:12,868 --> 00:05:14,934
Tire treads,
transmission fluid,

142
00:05:14,968 --> 00:05:16,366
oil residue?

143
00:05:16,367 --> 00:05:18,032
No, there's nothing, sir,
the trail's gone cold.

144
00:05:18,033 --> 00:05:19,233
Well, what about Walker?

145
00:05:19,234 --> 00:05:21,099
Did she get a good look
at these people?

146
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,399
I don't know, sir.

147
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,701
Frankly, she's pretty
messed up right now.

148
00:05:24,734 --> 00:05:25,733
Blaming herself

149
00:05:25,734 --> 00:05:26,733
for Jack's circumstances.

150
00:05:26,734 --> 00:05:28,066
Well, she should.

151
00:05:28,067 --> 00:05:30,534
She crippled this operation
when she murdered her contact.

152
00:05:30,567 --> 00:05:33,501
Without Vladimir Laitanan, we
have no lead to finding Bauer

153
00:05:33,534 --> 00:05:35,066
or the nuclear
materials.

154
00:05:35,067 --> 00:05:37,033
You get her back to CTU
for debriefing.

155
00:05:37,067 --> 00:05:38,700
I want to know
what the hell happened.

156
00:05:38,701 --> 00:05:40,566
Yes, sir.

157
00:05:40,567 --> 00:05:41,600
You might want
to consider

158
00:05:41,601 --> 00:05:43,166
running a psych eval
on her when we arrive.

159
00:05:43,167 --> 00:05:44,733
Count on it.

160
00:05:44,734 --> 00:05:45,999
You were supposed

161
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,700
to be coordinating
with NSA,

162
00:05:47,701 --> 00:05:49,032
monitoring chatter.

163
00:05:49,033 --> 00:05:50,934
I know, something came up,
I had to take care of it.

164
00:05:50,968 --> 00:05:52,868
What was so important?

165
00:05:54,267 --> 00:05:56,167
It's my fault, Mr. Hastings.

166
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,533
I asked Dana to
recover a datalog

167
00:05:57,534 --> 00:05:59,366
I accidentally deleted
from archives.

168
00:05:59,367 --> 00:06:01,267
I didn't have clearance.

169
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,734
I'm uplinking to
NSA servers now.

170
00:06:07,434 --> 00:06:08,999
All right.

171
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,166
Just get on it.

172
00:06:10,167 --> 00:06:12,334
Roll back any chatter
within the last 20 minutes.

173
00:06:12,367 --> 00:06:14,501
Right now
that's all we've got.

174
00:06:14,534 --> 00:06:15,967
Let me know
if something turns up.

175
00:06:15,968 --> 00:06:18,934
I need to brief
President Taylor.

176
00:06:19,934 --> 00:06:21,533
Thank you.

177
00:06:21,534 --> 00:06:22,967
You can thank me
by putting aside

178
00:06:22,968 --> 00:06:24,533
whatever it is
that's bothering you

179
00:06:24,534 --> 00:06:25,633
and helping me
find Jack.

180
00:06:25,634 --> 00:06:26,633
He's my friend

181
00:06:26,634 --> 00:06:28,601
and he's in trouble.

182
00:06:43,234 --> 00:06:45,834
Take him down the hall.

183
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:51,801
Where is Vladimir?

184
00:06:51,834 --> 00:06:52,933
Dead.

185
00:06:52,934 --> 00:06:55,400
So are his men.

186
00:06:55,434 --> 00:06:58,133
The German said
they tried to rip him off.

187
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:02,033
Did he also say how he knows
about the fuel rods?

188
00:07:28,567 --> 00:07:29,900
Who are you?

189
00:07:29,901 --> 00:07:31,968
Ernst Meier.

190
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,901
I've been looking for you
to make you an offer.

191
00:07:34,934 --> 00:07:36,533
You know who I am?

192
00:07:36,534 --> 00:07:37,533
No.

193
00:07:37,534 --> 00:07:38,666
All I know is that there's

194
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:39,999
a very powerful man
in the Russian syndicate

195
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,333
who's been trafficking
weapons-grade uranium,

196
00:07:41,334 --> 00:07:43,667
specifically U-235

197
00:07:43,701 --> 00:07:44,800
fuel rods.

198
00:07:44,801 --> 00:07:46,801
After the nasty business
with Laitanan,

199
00:07:46,834 --> 00:07:48,533
these men brought me here,

200
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:51,000
so I'm just assuming
you're that man.

201
00:07:51,033 --> 00:07:53,767
Where did you get
this information?

202
00:07:53,801 --> 00:07:56,434
I represent a consortium
of private interests.

203
00:07:56,467 --> 00:07:59,067
They intercepted communiqués
within the Islamic republic.

204
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,434
From whom?

205
00:08:02,501 --> 00:08:04,501
Farhad Hassan...

206
00:08:04,534 --> 00:08:06,534
or someone
in his camp.

207
00:08:06,567 --> 00:08:09,367
In either case, you're doing
business with the wrong people.

208
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,634
And who are these people-
the ones you work for?

209
00:08:13,667 --> 00:08:15,634
I'm sure you can understand

210
00:08:15,667 --> 00:08:17,734
I'm not at liberty to say.

211
00:08:23,267 --> 00:08:25,167
Aah!

212
00:08:25,901 --> 00:08:27,433
You should be less concerned
about who I work for

213
00:08:27,434 --> 00:08:28,533
and more concerned
about the deal

214
00:08:28,534 --> 00:08:29,900
that they're willing
to offer you.

215
00:08:29,901 --> 00:08:32,167
I'm not interested
in your offer.

216
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,133
$250 million,

217
00:08:34,167 --> 00:08:36,834
half of which is ready to be
wired to you immediately.

218
00:08:36,868 --> 00:08:38,399
The other half you will receive

219
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,834
upon final acquisition
of the fuel rods.

220
00:08:49,367 --> 00:08:51,199
You pose
a very difficult problem for me.

221
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,666
You show up
out of nowhere,

222
00:08:52,667 --> 00:08:55,033
knowing far too much
of my business,

223
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:56,533
yet I've never
heard of you.

224
00:08:56,534 --> 00:08:59,534
You've never heard of me
because I'm good at what I do.

225
00:08:59,567 --> 00:09:04,000
What I'm concerned about...
is that you're a cop.

226
00:09:04,033 --> 00:09:05,900
I just killed three people
back at that garage.

227
00:09:05,901 --> 00:09:08,200
Vladimir Laitanan-
I stabbed in the eye.

228
00:09:08,234 --> 00:09:10,834
You really think I'm a cop?

229
00:09:10,868 --> 00:09:12,066
As a child,

230
00:09:12,067 --> 00:09:14,767
I saw KGB throw
an entire family

231
00:09:14,801 --> 00:09:16,433
off the roof of a building,

232
00:09:16,434 --> 00:09:20,000
two of them small children.

233
00:09:20,033 --> 00:09:22,968
I know what cops are capable of.

234
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,299
So I ask you again:

235
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,466
Who do you work for?

236
00:09:25,467 --> 00:09:28,334
I'm sorry,
I can't tell you that.

237
00:09:28,367 --> 00:09:30,667
Dimitri, work on him
until he's ready

238
00:09:30,701 --> 00:09:32,601
to tell us everything.

239
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,167
No, we can make a deal.

240
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,967
We can still make a deal!

241
00:09:37,968 --> 00:09:40,100
No! No!

242
00:09:41,167 --> 00:09:43,167
No!

243
00:09:50,634 --> 00:09:52,601
You have buried
your brother's body?

244
00:10:03,968 --> 00:10:06,801
It's Oleg's necklace.

245
00:10:06,834 --> 00:10:09,133
You gave it to him
at his confirmation.

246
00:10:11,167 --> 00:10:13,067
You keep it.

247
00:10:14,067 --> 00:10:16,567
To remind you of him.

248
00:10:19,534 --> 00:10:22,067
I'm glad you're back.

249
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,234
We may have
a problem.

250
00:10:24,267 --> 00:10:25,666
What is it?

251
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:30,234
There is a man down the hall
who claims to be an arms broker.

252
00:10:30,267 --> 00:10:32,300
He knows about the nuclear rods.

253
00:10:32,334 --> 00:10:34,400
How could he?

254
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:40,100
He says there was a leak from
Farhad's people, but I wonder.

255
00:10:40,133 --> 00:10:43,567
Until I know for certain
who and what this man is,

256
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:45,466
I've stopped the transport
of the rods.

257
00:10:45,467 --> 00:10:47,299
They've been redirected
to our weigh station

258
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,600
off the Wantagh Parkway.

259
00:10:48,601 --> 00:10:51,167
I'm sure Farhad can't
be happy about that.

260
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,667
I haven't told him yet.

261
00:10:58,334 --> 00:11:00,334
Perhaps we should
tell him together.

262
00:11:01,968 --> 00:11:04,300
How long do you plan
to hold him off?

263
00:11:04,334 --> 00:11:05,633
That depends.

264
00:11:05,634 --> 00:11:06,999
On what?

265
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,701
On how long it takes Dimitri
to break this guy.

266
00:11:22,667 --> 00:11:24,433
Okay, Mr. Policeman.

267
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:25,533
I'm not a cop.

268
00:11:25,534 --> 00:11:26,700
I swear to you.

269
00:11:26,701 --> 00:11:28,601
Please, don't do this.

270
00:11:33,634 --> 00:11:35,534
Tell me what you know.

271
00:11:51,967 --> 00:11:53,566
We are exhausting all efforts

272
00:11:53,567 --> 00:11:56,001
to ascertain who took Bauer
and where,

273
00:11:56,034 --> 00:11:58,500
but until any progress is made,
we just have to hope

274
00:11:58,533 --> 00:11:59,900
that Jack can find some way

275
00:11:59,901 --> 00:12:01,766
of salvaging the operation
on his end.

276
00:12:01,767 --> 00:12:03,901
What even makes you think
he's still alive?

277
00:12:03,934 --> 00:12:05,466
Only the fact
that he wasn't killed

278
00:12:05,467 --> 00:12:06,799
at the point of abduction.

279
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,934
Mr. Hastings,
I need a realistic assessment.

280
00:12:08,967 --> 00:12:11,433
What are the odds of
finding and securing

281
00:12:11,467 --> 00:12:13,700
these nuclear weapons
within the next few hours?

282
00:12:13,734 --> 00:12:14,866
I can't answer that, ma'am,

283
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:16,367
but the longer
we're out of touch

284
00:12:16,368 --> 00:12:18,500
with Bauer,
the less likely our chances.

285
00:12:18,533 --> 00:12:20,367
All right, Mr. Hastings.

286
00:12:20,368 --> 00:12:22,533
Continue to coordinate
with my office.

287
00:12:22,567 --> 00:12:24,533
I want updates every 30 minutes.

288
00:12:24,567 --> 00:12:26,467
Yes, ma'am.

289
00:12:27,467 --> 00:12:29,700
I just spoke to General Wasim.

290
00:12:29,734 --> 00:12:31,066
He's very worried.

291
00:12:31,067 --> 00:12:33,967
Your brother's crackdowns
back home are intensifying.

292
00:12:34,001 --> 00:12:35,901
Everyone
is being arrested.

293
00:12:35,901 --> 00:12:38,034
Our window of opportunity
is closing.

294
00:12:38,067 --> 00:12:39,967
And why didn't the general
call me himself?

295
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:41,166
Perhaps he's losing confidence

296
00:12:41,167 --> 00:12:43,134
in your ability
to complete our mission.

297
00:12:43,167 --> 00:12:44,466
This is my mission.

298
00:12:44,467 --> 00:12:45,633
My plan!

299
00:12:45,634 --> 00:12:47,000
Of course.

300
00:12:47,001 --> 00:12:48,934
But we're running
out of time.

301
00:12:48,967 --> 00:12:50,532
If your brother dismantles
our opposition forces,

302
00:12:50,533 --> 00:12:51,900
we will no
longer be able

303
00:12:51,901 --> 00:12:53,300
to reconstitute our
nuclear program.

304
00:12:53,301 --> 00:12:54,799
He won't succeed.

305
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,700
At this rate, he will.

306
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,466
How much longer
must we wait

307
00:12:58,467 --> 00:13:00,133
for the delivery
of the uranium?

308
00:13:00,134 --> 00:13:01,733
Not long.

309
00:13:01,734 --> 00:13:04,001
The rods should be arriving
to you within the hour.

310
00:13:04,034 --> 00:13:05,934
Have your men ready.

311
00:13:06,834 --> 00:13:08,734
I'll call you back.

312
00:13:10,034 --> 00:13:11,466
Yes? What is it?

313
00:13:11,467 --> 00:13:13,533
There is a man downstairs
who's shown up

314
00:13:13,567 --> 00:13:15,432
to outbid you for
the fuel rods.

315
00:13:15,433 --> 00:13:18,567
Is this some feeble attempt
to renegotiate terms?

316
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,367
Not at all. This man, Meier,

317
00:13:20,368 --> 00:13:21,933
claims someone in
your organization

318
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:23,499
tipped him off to our deal.

319
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,333
That's not possible. He's lying.

320
00:13:25,334 --> 00:13:27,268
At any rate, in light of
his sudden appearance,

321
00:13:27,301 --> 00:13:29,368
I'm halting delivery of the rods
for the time being.

322
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,633
What? You can't do that.

323
00:13:30,634 --> 00:13:31,866
It's already done.

324
00:13:31,867 --> 00:13:35,167
I cannot take the risk
that we may be exposed.

325
00:13:35,201 --> 00:13:36,633
The longer you delay,
the more time

326
00:13:36,634 --> 00:13:38,100
my brother has
to crush his enemies.

327
00:13:38,101 --> 00:13:40,034
If he manages to purge everyone
in the military

328
00:13:40,067 --> 00:13:42,467
who opposes him,
the uranium is worthless to me.

329
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,666
That's your concern.

330
00:13:43,667 --> 00:13:45,667
Mine is to make
certain this Meier

331
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,833
is not a policeman.

332
00:13:46,834 --> 00:13:48,734
One of my men
is interrogating him now.

333
00:13:48,734 --> 00:13:51,001
That could take hours,
even days.

334
00:13:51,034 --> 00:13:52,532
Not days.

335
00:13:52,533 --> 00:13:55,301
I can promise you that.

336
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,533
You promised
to assassinate my brother, too.

337
00:13:57,567 --> 00:13:58,866
Your failure
to eliminate him

338
00:13:58,867 --> 00:14:00,800
has put me under
enormous pressure, and now,

339
00:14:00,834 --> 00:14:03,334
because of your people's
inability to maintain secrecy,

340
00:14:03,368 --> 00:14:07,268
you break our agreed timetable
to suit your needs.

341
00:14:08,334 --> 00:14:10,334
Don't speak
to my father that way.

342
00:14:10,368 --> 00:14:12,800
We've honored
every agreement

343
00:14:12,834 --> 00:14:13,933
we made with you,

344
00:14:13,934 --> 00:14:15,699
and shed a lot
of blood for it.

345
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,800
My father's allowed you
to stay here

346
00:14:17,834 --> 00:14:19,000
and hide from the Feds

347
00:14:19,001 --> 00:14:21,567
at great personal risk
to our family.

348
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,700
Tell him to put the gun down.

349
00:14:25,734 --> 00:14:26,933
No.

350
00:14:26,934 --> 00:14:30,034
We're not taking any
more of your demands.

351
00:14:30,067 --> 00:14:31,833
Throw him out
of here.

352
00:14:31,834 --> 00:14:35,533
Let his own people shelter him
if he thinks we're such fools.

353
00:14:35,567 --> 00:14:37,100
I'll drive him
there myself

354
00:14:37,101 --> 00:14:39,001
if that's what
it takes.

355
00:14:43,134 --> 00:14:45,667
It would seem you have used up
our hospitality here.

356
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,499
Perhaps it's best
you join your men

357
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,901
at the rendezvous point
to wait for delivery.

358
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,399
And when will that be?

359
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,233
When I think it's safe.

360
00:14:57,234 --> 00:14:59,134
Not a moment before.

361
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:09,134
Make sure he gets
where he's going.

362
00:15:33,067 --> 00:15:34,432
Still got men

363
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:36,100
back at the scene
in case we missed something.

364
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:37,833
In the meantime,
I'll work out

365
00:15:37,834 --> 00:15:40,667
the aerial sweep
protocols with Arlo.

366
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,532
What are you doing to find Jack?

367
00:15:42,533 --> 00:15:44,734
Everything we can, Ms. Walker.
Come with me.

368
00:15:44,767 --> 00:15:46,800
Have you checked
all the... the traffic cams,

369
00:15:46,834 --> 00:15:48,133
subway routes?

370
00:15:48,134 --> 00:15:49,966
You have all this technology
working for you-

371
00:15:49,967 --> 00:15:51,599
comm surveillance,
satellite tracking.

372
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,167
We're using everything
at our disposal.

373
00:15:54,201 --> 00:15:56,268
Then how come
you haven't found him yet?

374
00:15:56,301 --> 00:15:57,933
Why don't you have any leads?

375
00:15:57,934 --> 00:16:00,134
The best lead we had is dead.

376
00:16:01,934 --> 00:16:04,034
I know about
your suicide attempt.

377
00:16:04,067 --> 00:16:06,101
You should have been honest
with me.

378
00:16:06,134 --> 00:16:09,567
O'Brian will take
your statement.

379
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,201
I want to know every detail
about every event

380
00:16:12,234 --> 00:16:14,167
leading up to the death
of Vladimir Laitanan.

381
00:16:20,834 --> 00:16:22,734
When she's done,
take her to medical.

382
00:16:22,734 --> 00:16:25,001
I've ordered a full
psych evaluation.

383
00:16:25,034 --> 00:16:27,067
Yes, sir.

384
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,700
Uh,

385
00:16:32,734 --> 00:16:34,700
you can write
your statement here.

386
00:16:42,467 --> 00:16:44,500
Hastings blames me
for what happened to Jack.

387
00:16:44,533 --> 00:16:46,000
And he's right.

388
00:16:46,001 --> 00:16:47,633
No, he's not.

389
00:16:47,634 --> 00:16:49,532
He shouldn't have said that.

390
00:16:49,533 --> 00:16:51,399
The only reason
that Jack was even

391
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:54,734
part of this operation
was because of me.

392
00:16:54,767 --> 00:16:56,667
So whatever they're doing
to him right now,

393
00:16:56,667 --> 00:16:58,901
it's because of me.

394
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:03,201
I have to find him, Chloe.

395
00:17:03,234 --> 00:17:07,034
Renee, I know how you must feel.

396
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:10,400
Just... just take
one thing at a time.

397
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,967
We have to deal
with what you did.

398
00:17:16,001 --> 00:17:18,167
So write your
statement.

399
00:17:18,201 --> 00:17:20,334
Ill check back with you.

400
00:17:29,334 --> 00:17:30,599
Cole.

401
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,599
Hey.

402
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,966
Do you have some time?

403
00:17:32,967 --> 00:17:34,300
I need to talk to you.

404
00:17:34,301 --> 00:17:35,733
Can it wait?

405
00:17:35,734 --> 00:17:37,834
I need to review these protocols
before Arlo distributes them.

406
00:17:37,867 --> 00:17:39,432
I've got it covered.

407
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:41,333
Go talk to your girlfriend.

408
00:17:52,268 --> 00:17:53,633
What's up?

409
00:17:53,634 --> 00:17:54,799
You all right?

410
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,901
No, I'm not.

411
00:17:56,934 --> 00:17:58,300
I have a big problem.

412
00:17:58,301 --> 00:18:02,433
And it's the reason why
I've been acting kind of weird

413
00:18:02,467 --> 00:18:04,133
the past few days.

414
00:18:04,134 --> 00:18:06,101
Okay.

415
00:18:08,467 --> 00:18:10,367
Listen, if you're
calling off the engagement,

416
00:18:10,368 --> 00:18:12,133
you couldn't have
picked a worse day.

417
00:18:12,134 --> 00:18:14,234
No.

418
00:18:14,268 --> 00:18:16,166
No, I would never do that.

419
00:18:16,167 --> 00:18:17,699
Good.

420
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,166
So what's bothering you?

421
00:18:19,167 --> 00:18:22,067
There are things about my past

422
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,533
that I haven't told you.

423
00:18:24,567 --> 00:18:26,867
I'm listening.

424
00:18:29,934 --> 00:18:31,033
Hey.

425
00:18:31,034 --> 00:18:32,532
I'm sure I haven't told you

426
00:18:32,533 --> 00:18:34,800
everything about
my past either.

427
00:18:34,834 --> 00:18:37,800
I don't care what happened
before I met you.

428
00:18:37,834 --> 00:18:39,399
All that matters is now

429
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,166
and what we have
to look forward to.

430
00:18:41,167 --> 00:18:45,433
I think that's all
that matters, too.

431
00:18:45,467 --> 00:18:48,034
So what are you
so worried about?

432
00:18:50,101 --> 00:18:52,001
I don't want to lose you.

433
00:18:52,034 --> 00:18:54,834
I'm not going anywhere.

434
00:18:56,433 --> 00:18:58,100
Excuse me.

435
00:18:58,101 --> 00:19:00,533
Agent Ortiz, Mr. Hastings
needs to see you in his office.

436
00:19:00,567 --> 00:19:02,734
Uh, tell him I'll be
there as soon as I can.

437
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:04,633
No. Go.
Hastings can wait.

438
00:19:04,634 --> 00:19:05,900
So can this.

439
00:19:05,901 --> 00:19:07,633
Talking to you has helped.

440
00:19:07,634 --> 00:19:09,867
I think I know
what I need to do now.

441
00:19:09,901 --> 00:19:11,633
You sure?

442
00:19:11,634 --> 00:19:13,333
Mm-hmm.

443
00:19:13,334 --> 00:19:15,800
Okay.

444
00:19:15,834 --> 00:19:18,134
Maybe later you tell me
what this is all about.

445
00:19:37,334 --> 00:19:39,234
Who do you
work for?

446
00:19:44,901 --> 00:19:46,801
Who else knows
about the fuel rods?

447
00:19:48,934 --> 00:19:50,100
Everybody
has a limit.

448
00:19:50,101 --> 00:19:52,800
Don't worry,

449
00:19:52,834 --> 00:19:54,734
I'll find yours.

450
00:19:58,268 --> 00:19:59,933
You're working with the police.

451
00:19:59,934 --> 00:20:01,166
Admit it!

452
00:20:01,167 --> 00:20:03,234
Tell me and the
pain will stop.

453
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:05,168
Who else knows?

454
00:20:08,734 --> 00:20:12,034
I told you... I'm not a cop.

455
00:20:12,067 --> 00:20:13,066
Please.

456
00:20:13,067 --> 00:20:15,400
I'm just a businessman.

457
00:20:15,433 --> 00:20:16,633
Please.

458
00:20:16,634 --> 00:20:18,534
Who do you work for?

459
00:20:20,067 --> 00:20:22,500
I'm an independent contractor.

460
00:20:22,533 --> 00:20:24,333
I couldn't even tell you
if I wanted.

461
00:20:24,334 --> 00:20:26,234
Please.

462
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,600
We'll see.

463
00:20:36,634 --> 00:20:38,233
Wake up.

464
00:20:38,234 --> 00:20:40,800
I said, wake up.

465
00:21:57,967 --> 00:22:00,501
I told you
I didn't want to be disturbed.

466
00:22:00,534 --> 00:22:03,401
Your daughter is still demanding
to see you, Mr. President.

467
00:22:03,434 --> 00:22:05,567
She refuses to leave.

468
00:22:05,601 --> 00:22:07,501
Very well. Send her in.

469
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,967
Kayla, my love,

470
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,467
I'm in the middle of a crisis,
so unless it's an emergency...

471
00:22:17,501 --> 00:22:19,467
It is an emergency.

472
00:22:19,501 --> 00:22:21,933
We need to talk about you
having Tarin arrested.

473
00:22:21,967 --> 00:22:23,933
Tarin has been taken
to the embassy

474
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:26,933
to help clarify a few questions,

475
00:22:26,967 --> 00:22:28,366
strictly routine.

476
00:22:28,367 --> 00:22:30,701
I know you believe
he's been working against you.

477
00:22:30,734 --> 00:22:33,167
What I don't understand is why.

478
00:22:35,234 --> 00:22:37,200
He refused to follow my orders.

479
00:22:37,234 --> 00:22:39,200
You asked him to
arrest the family

480
00:22:39,234 --> 00:22:40,932
of one of
your delegates.

481
00:22:40,933 --> 00:22:42,900
A man you considered
a friend.

482
00:22:42,933 --> 00:22:45,900
Kayla, this is a matter of
state; it doesn't concern you.

483
00:22:45,933 --> 00:22:47,900
It doesn't make sense.

484
00:22:47,933 --> 00:22:49,767
Tarin was in the car with you-

485
00:22:49,768 --> 00:22:51,734
if the assassination
attempt was successful,

486
00:22:51,768 --> 00:22:53,266
he would've been killed, too.

487
00:22:53,267 --> 00:22:55,800
The world is full of men willing
to die for their cause.

488
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:57,800
I know you consider
Tarin a friend.

489
00:22:57,833 --> 00:22:59,900
And your loyalty
is commendable.

490
00:22:59,933 --> 00:23:01,600
But trust me, I have my reasons.

491
00:23:01,601 --> 00:23:04,200
We are more than friends.

492
00:23:04,234 --> 00:23:06,367
We're in love,

493
00:23:06,401 --> 00:23:08,467
and have been for almost a year.

494
00:23:12,267 --> 00:23:15,267
You've been carrying on
with this man

495
00:23:15,301 --> 00:23:17,534
behind my back?

496
00:23:17,567 --> 00:23:19,400
You say that to me,

497
00:23:19,401 --> 00:23:21,367
after driving mother away
with your infidelity.

498
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:27,067
Please, Father.

499
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:29,067
Don't let Uncle Farhad's
betrayal

500
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,600
turn you against everyone

501
00:23:30,601 --> 00:23:33,567
who cares about you.

502
00:23:33,601 --> 00:23:36,567
I can't think of a better way

503
00:23:36,601 --> 00:23:39,567
to completely infiltrate my life
and influence my judgment

504
00:23:39,601 --> 00:23:42,434
than getting close
to my daughter.

505
00:23:42,467 --> 00:23:44,534
It's not like that.

506
00:23:44,567 --> 00:23:46,867
You're not to see that man
again, ever.

507
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,600
Father...

508
00:23:48,601 --> 00:23:49,966
I'm done with
this conversation.

509
00:23:49,967 --> 00:23:51,933
I need to get back to my work.

510
00:23:54,401 --> 00:23:56,401
What's happening to you?

511
00:25:19,701 --> 00:25:22,034
Come on.

512
00:25:23,701 --> 00:25:25,701
Damn it!

513
00:25:30,434 --> 00:25:33,434
I am holding the rods
until Meier comes clean

514
00:25:33,467 --> 00:25:34,966
about how he knew
of the transfer.

515
00:25:34,967 --> 00:25:38,134
If what Meier said is true about
the leak in Farhad's team,

516
00:25:38,167 --> 00:25:39,566
it will be dangerous for us.

517
00:25:39,567 --> 00:25:41,900
So we must unload the
rods, finish this.

518
00:25:41,933 --> 00:25:44,167
Let them be someone
else's problem...

519
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,334
And we erase any evidence.

520
00:25:46,367 --> 00:25:49,467
Once Dimitri is finished,
and I'm satisfied

521
00:25:49,501 --> 00:25:50,733
the German is telling the truth,

522
00:25:50,734 --> 00:25:52,533
I'm going to want
to hand off the rods

523
00:25:52,534 --> 00:25:55,301
to Farhad tonight.

524
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:06,734
Keep your men out of sight
along the perimeter.

525
00:26:06,768 --> 00:26:09,734
Mikhail and his men will stay
with the cargo.

526
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,800
Check to see if the rest
of the street lost power.

527
00:26:22,367 --> 00:26:24,367
Just us.

528
00:26:24,401 --> 00:26:26,668
It's Meier.

529
00:26:26,701 --> 00:26:28,668
Cover the exits.

530
00:26:31,701 --> 00:26:34,334
Check the fuse box.

531
00:27:22,701 --> 00:27:24,701
Come on.

532
00:27:27,301 --> 00:27:29,066
CTU. O'Brian.

533
00:27:29,067 --> 00:27:30,266
Chloe. It's Jack.

534
00:27:30,267 --> 00:27:31,600
Jack, everyone's
been looking for you.

535
00:27:31,601 --> 00:27:32,600
Where are you?

536
00:27:32,601 --> 00:27:33,767
I need you to trace this call

537
00:27:33,768 --> 00:27:34,932
and send
a Tac team immediately.

538
00:27:34,933 --> 00:27:36,600
Jack? Chloe, just
trace the call.

539
00:27:36,601 --> 00:27:38,501
Jack!

540
00:27:51,301 --> 00:27:53,234
*

541
00:29:20,334 --> 00:29:23,701
We're sure NYPD's got
the perimeter locked down?

542
00:29:23,734 --> 00:29:26,100
The restaurant and everything
in a block radius is secure.

543
00:29:26,134 --> 00:29:30,000
Our response team
will be there soon.

544
00:29:30,034 --> 00:29:31,366
Where's Dana?

545
00:29:31,367 --> 00:29:33,401
She logged out of the building
about 15 minutes ago.

546
00:29:33,434 --> 00:29:35,534
Something about
fixing a faulty relay

547
00:29:35,567 --> 00:29:37,099
at our 17th Street station.

548
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:39,200
Why didn't she just have
IP maintenance take care of it?

549
00:29:39,234 --> 00:29:40,600
Good question.

550
00:29:40,601 --> 00:29:43,200
She had to manually reboot
the firmware herself.

551
00:29:43,234 --> 00:29:45,668
That's what she said anyway.

552
00:29:45,701 --> 00:29:48,234
Where are we
with this man Bazhaev?

553
00:29:48,267 --> 00:29:49,500
It's coming
through right now.

554
00:29:49,501 --> 00:29:51,534
I've cross-accessed
interagency servers,

555
00:29:51,567 --> 00:29:53,734
also Interpol and FSB.

556
00:29:53,768 --> 00:29:55,166
I'm relaying intel
as it comes in

557
00:29:55,167 --> 00:29:57,301
to our response team
and to Jack.

558
00:29:57,334 --> 00:29:59,234
Good. Put it up on screen.

559
00:30:00,434 --> 00:30:03,200
Okay, people.

560
00:30:03,234 --> 00:30:05,467
We've ID'd the suspect
we have in custody.

561
00:30:05,501 --> 00:30:09,467
His name
is Sergei Petrovich Bazhaev,

562
00:30:09,501 --> 00:30:11,933
Ukrainian national,
61 years of age.

563
00:30:11,967 --> 00:30:13,633
Now, we believe
he knows the location

564
00:30:13,634 --> 00:30:15,500
of the unsecured nuclear rods.

565
00:30:15,501 --> 00:30:18,000
Now, tactical is on its way
to transport him back here

566
00:30:18,034 --> 00:30:19,400
for interrogation.

567
00:30:19,401 --> 00:30:22,234
Agent Ortiz will coordinate
operations from here.

568
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,301
Is it true?
You found Jack?

569
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:37,234
Yeah. He's okay.

570
00:30:39,567 --> 00:30:40,999
If you're finished
with your statement,

571
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,466
I need to take you
to medical.

572
00:30:42,467 --> 00:30:45,100
No. No. I want to be here
when Jack gets back.

573
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:46,600
I'll let him know
where to find you.

574
00:30:46,601 --> 00:30:48,900
Come on.

575
00:30:48,933 --> 00:30:51,200
Mr. Bauer, this should
hold you for now.

576
00:30:51,234 --> 00:30:52,799
But you're going to have
to go to the hospital.

577
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,266
Okay.
Excuse me, sir.

578
00:30:54,267 --> 00:30:56,167
They uploaded
the suspect's file right now.

579
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:02,134
How far out is CTU?

580
00:31:02,167 --> 00:31:03,966
They're about five
minutes out.

581
00:31:03,967 --> 00:31:05,867
It's all right.
I got it. Thanks.

582
00:31:20,534 --> 00:31:21,866
Sergeant?

583
00:31:21,867 --> 00:31:24,768
I need to speak
with this man alone.

584
00:31:34,567 --> 00:31:36,701
I knew you were a cop.

585
00:31:36,734 --> 00:31:38,199
I should have
trusted my instincts

586
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,433
and killed you on the spot.

587
00:31:39,434 --> 00:31:43,501
Well, you can add it
to your list of regrets.

588
00:31:43,534 --> 00:31:46,134
CTU's already acquired a
great deal of intel on you,

589
00:31:46,167 --> 00:31:49,967
Mr. Bazhaev.

590
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,668
It's over. You
know that, right?

591
00:31:52,701 --> 00:31:54,601
You're finished.

592
00:31:56,167 --> 00:31:58,067
I mean, at the very
least, we've got you

593
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,366
on kidnapping and murder,
and that's before

594
00:31:59,367 --> 00:32:01,467
CTU rips this place apart
and uncovers the rest

595
00:32:01,501 --> 00:32:03,933
of your criminal activity.

596
00:32:03,967 --> 00:32:07,668
Lucky for you, though, I'm
only interested in one thing,

597
00:32:07,701 --> 00:32:10,434
and that's the acquisition
of those fuel rods.

598
00:32:10,467 --> 00:32:13,701
So, if you were
to cooperate,

599
00:32:13,734 --> 00:32:16,701
help me out there,

600
00:32:16,734 --> 00:32:18,933
that would go a
long way to reducing

601
00:32:18,967 --> 00:32:21,800
what is clearly going to be
a very long prison sentence.

602
00:32:23,668 --> 00:32:27,100
That offer extends to
both of your sons, too-

603
00:32:27,134 --> 00:32:29,167
Josef and Oleg.

604
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,067
Oleg is dead.

605
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:36,067
He was exposed
to the rods.

606
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:39,200
Became ill with
radiation poisoning.

607
00:32:39,234 --> 00:32:41,534
He was suffering,

608
00:32:41,567 --> 00:32:44,734
and I shot him,

609
00:32:44,768 --> 00:32:48,267
as if he was
just a sick dog.

610
00:32:50,833 --> 00:32:52,833
I murdered my own son.

611
00:32:54,933 --> 00:32:56,900
For nothing.

612
00:33:07,067 --> 00:33:09,534
You want to know
where the rods are?

613
00:33:09,567 --> 00:33:11,333
I will tell you.

614
00:33:11,334 --> 00:33:12,767
But I want full immunity.

615
00:33:12,768 --> 00:33:15,567
Not just for me,
but for my other son, Josef.

616
00:33:15,601 --> 00:33:17,668
I don't think
I can make that happen.

617
00:33:17,701 --> 00:33:19,668
Then we have nothing
to talk about.

618
00:33:33,167 --> 00:33:35,167
I'll see what I can do.

619
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:44,167
CTU. O'Brian.

620
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,366
Chloe, it's Jack.

621
00:33:45,367 --> 00:33:46,832
I need to speak
with Hastings.

622
00:33:46,833 --> 00:33:49,200
I think he's in the middle of a
briefing with President Taylor.

623
00:33:49,234 --> 00:33:51,234
Even better. See if you
can patch me in, okay?

624
00:33:51,267 --> 00:33:53,133
Okay.

625
00:33:53,134 --> 00:33:56,034
Mr. Hastings, it's Farhad Hassan
I'm worried about.

626
00:33:56,067 --> 00:33:57,233
How do we know
he hasn't acquired

627
00:33:57,234 --> 00:33:58,433
the rods already?

628
00:33:58,434 --> 00:34:00,300
Based on the intel we have,
the transfer hasn't

629
00:34:00,301 --> 00:34:01,600
taken place yet.

630
00:34:01,601 --> 00:34:03,466
Madam President,
excuse the interruption.

631
00:34:03,467 --> 00:34:04,633
Jack Bauer is on the line.

632
00:34:04,634 --> 00:34:05,799
He wishes to be conferenced in.

633
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:06,966
Put him through.

634
00:34:06,967 --> 00:34:08,199
Jack, it's President Taylor.

635
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,633
You're on with Mr. Hastings

636
00:34:09,634 --> 00:34:11,133
and my chief of staff.

637
00:34:11,134 --> 00:34:14,434
CTU's been keeping me apprised
of your involvement in this.

638
00:34:14,467 --> 00:34:16,900
I'm sorry that it's taken
this long for us to speak.

639
00:34:16,933 --> 00:34:18,266
I understand, and
please forgive me

640
00:34:18,267 --> 00:34:19,600
for getting straight
to the point,

641
00:34:19,601 --> 00:34:21,466
but the man that
we have in custody,

642
00:34:21,467 --> 00:34:22,866
Sergei Bazhaev, is
willing to cooperate.

643
00:34:22,867 --> 00:34:24,967
He said he would hand
over the fuel rods

644
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,933
in exchange for full
immunity for him and his son.

645
00:34:26,967 --> 00:34:28,199
Is that all?

646
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,134
Why don't me give him a parade
down Broadway, too?

647
00:34:30,167 --> 00:34:31,500
Jack, you've been dealing
with this man.

648
00:34:31,501 --> 00:34:33,199
Is there no other way
to get the location

649
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,533
of the nuclear
materials out of him?

650
00:34:34,534 --> 00:34:35,767
It says in his files

651
00:34:35,768 --> 00:34:37,668
that he did 12 years
in a Russian labor camp.

652
00:34:37,701 --> 00:34:39,433
In the time frame
that we have,

653
00:34:39,434 --> 00:34:41,800
we're not gonna break him,
Madam President.

654
00:34:41,833 --> 00:34:43,466
I can see it in his eyes.

655
00:34:43,467 --> 00:34:45,534
Mr. Hastings, what
is your assessment?

656
00:34:45,567 --> 00:34:48,734
Well, at first blush, I'd say
an immunity deal is premature,

657
00:34:48,768 --> 00:34:50,266
but under the circumstances,

658
00:34:50,267 --> 00:34:52,900
I'll defer
to Jack's judgment on this.

659
00:34:52,933 --> 00:34:55,768
Gentlemen, I have a peace deal
that's going to fall apart

660
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:58,367
at any moment unless I
can show President Hassan

661
00:34:58,401 --> 00:34:59,966
that we have
stopped his brother

662
00:34:59,967 --> 00:35:02,668
from smuggling those fuel
rods out of the country.

663
00:35:02,701 --> 00:35:05,434
Make the deal, Jack.

664
00:35:05,467 --> 00:35:07,199
Madam President, he's going
to want this in writing.

665
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,366
He'll get it.

666
00:35:08,367 --> 00:35:10,933
But in the interests
of expediency,

667
00:35:10,967 --> 00:35:12,466
put him on the phone with me.

668
00:35:12,467 --> 00:35:14,434
Yes, ma'am.

669
00:35:16,301 --> 00:35:18,234
The President
of the United States

670
00:35:18,267 --> 00:35:20,167
wants to talk to you.

671
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,267
You want to tell me
what's going on?

672
00:35:34,301 --> 00:35:36,166
What are you talking about?

673
00:35:36,167 --> 00:35:37,266
You were implying something
about Dana,

674
00:35:37,267 --> 00:35:38,767
and I want to know what it is.

675
00:35:38,768 --> 00:35:41,301
When she came over before
and said

676
00:35:41,334 --> 00:35:44,267
she had to talk to you,
what did she tell you?

677
00:35:44,301 --> 00:35:45,566
Nothing.

678
00:35:45,567 --> 00:35:47,133
She said she had a problem,
and she'd handle it.

679
00:35:47,134 --> 00:35:48,300
That's it?

680
00:35:48,301 --> 00:35:49,999
Arlo, if you know something...

681
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,266
Okay, look,

682
00:35:51,267 --> 00:35:53,167
it's none of my business,

683
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,100
and I didn't want to be the one
to tell you this,

684
00:35:56,134 --> 00:35:58,301
but I think she went
to meet some guy.

685
00:36:01,567 --> 00:36:03,300
You're out of your mind.

686
00:36:03,301 --> 00:36:05,634
Take a look at this.

687
00:36:09,867 --> 00:36:11,033
Who is he?

688
00:36:11,034 --> 00:36:12,333
I checked with the gate.

689
00:36:12,334 --> 00:36:14,833
They said his name
is Kevin Wade.

690
00:36:14,867 --> 00:36:16,767
Identified himself as a friend.

691
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,434
Okay, so he's a friend.

692
00:36:32,534 --> 00:36:34,534
Cole?

693
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:37,701
Bazhaev's given up the location
of the nuclear rods.

694
00:36:37,734 --> 00:36:39,366
I've already scrambled
a NEST team.

695
00:36:39,367 --> 00:36:41,267
Meet your tactical unit

696
00:36:41,301 --> 00:36:42,466
at the helipad.

697
00:36:42,467 --> 00:36:44,199
The coordinates will be relayed
to you en route.

698
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,832
Yes, sir.

699
00:36:45,833 --> 00:36:47,768
You think you can find her?

700
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:50,434
I could if all the drones
weren't already committed.

701
00:36:50,467 --> 00:36:52,367
What about a cell trace?

702
00:36:53,833 --> 00:36:55,833
Just do it.

703
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,933
I don't know where you are
or what you're doing, Dana,

704
00:37:27,967 --> 00:37:30,467
but I need you to call me
as soon as you get this.

705
00:37:30,501 --> 00:37:31,832
It's important.

706
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:33,733
I love you.

707
00:37:41,401 --> 00:37:42,700
Thank you, sir.

708
00:37:42,701 --> 00:37:43,733
Sorry.

709
00:37:43,734 --> 00:37:45,634
Don't worry about it.

710
00:38:03,834 --> 00:38:04,899
Miss Kayla, no.

711
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,166
Get out of my way, Nabeel.

712
00:38:06,167 --> 00:38:07,400
I want to see him.

713
00:38:07,401 --> 00:38:09,301
Your father forbids it.

714
00:38:10,734 --> 00:38:13,368
I'm sorry.
I'm just doing my job.

715
00:38:13,401 --> 00:38:15,233
A job that Tarin gave you.

716
00:38:15,234 --> 00:38:17,100
He brought you
into my father's

717
00:38:17,101 --> 00:38:19,468
security detail,
and this is how you repay him?

718
00:38:21,567 --> 00:38:23,533
You're his friend, Nabeel.

719
00:38:23,567 --> 00:38:25,467
You know he's innocent.

720
00:38:25,468 --> 00:38:27,800
What would you have me do?

721
00:38:27,834 --> 00:38:29,632
Just let me speak to him.

722
00:38:29,633 --> 00:38:31,600
A few minutes is all I ask.

723
00:38:31,633 --> 00:38:34,167
I can't let you in now.

724
00:38:34,201 --> 00:38:36,867
Tarin's going to be readied
for transport

725
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,400
to our embassy in an hour.

726
00:38:38,401 --> 00:38:41,401
I will find a moment
you can see him before then.

727
00:38:41,434 --> 00:38:43,967
Thank you, Nabeel.

728
00:38:44,001 --> 00:38:47,134
Now go before we're both
in trouble.

729
00:38:55,967 --> 00:39:00,301
Cole, the NEST team's ETA is
two minutes from target site.

730
00:39:00,334 --> 00:39:04,201
Now the HAZMAT crew will wait
for your signal to move in.

731
00:39:04,234 --> 00:39:05,833
Be advised the truck with

732
00:39:05,834 --> 00:39:09,034
the fuel rods is being guarded
by two armed hostiles.

733
00:39:09,067 --> 00:39:11,567
Command, we have an immunity
deal with their boss.

734
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,533
Why haven't they been ordered
to stand down?

735
00:39:13,567 --> 00:39:17,267
Well, Jack's understanding is
that these men are hard cases.

736
00:39:17,301 --> 00:39:18,733
They won't roll over easily.

737
00:39:18,734 --> 00:39:21,633
We cannot take the risk that
they'll flee with the rods.

738
00:39:21,667 --> 00:39:22,699
Understood.

739
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:23,866
Now, when you secure

740
00:39:23,867 --> 00:39:25,133
the nuclear materials,

741
00:39:25,134 --> 00:39:26,899
you'll transport them
to Fort Hamilton.

742
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:29,234
We're clearing that air corridor
as we speak.

743
00:39:33,734 --> 00:39:35,000
Command, we
see the truck,

744
00:39:35,001 --> 00:39:36,934
but there's no
sign of hostiles.

745
00:39:36,967 --> 00:39:38,532
Approaching the weigh
station now. Stand by.

746
00:39:38,533 --> 00:39:40,800
Set us down there.

747
00:40:07,533 --> 00:40:09,200
Picking up trace radiation.

748
00:40:09,201 --> 00:40:11,500
30 millirads. It's safe.

749
00:40:11,533 --> 00:40:13,433
Go, go. Move in.

750
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,700
We're clear.

751
00:40:45,633 --> 00:40:47,567
Command, are you seeing this?

752
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,200
I am.

753
00:40:49,201 --> 00:40:51,234
Where the hell are the rods?

754
00:40:51,267 --> 00:40:53,800
We picked up trace
radiation signatures.

755
00:40:53,834 --> 00:40:55,233
The rods were here.

756
00:40:55,234 --> 00:40:57,767
Right now all we have
are two bodies, both shot.

757
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,934
Hey, Agent Ortiz.

758
00:41:24,667 --> 00:41:27,867
Come on, man,
you can have a good time.

759
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:30,034
It's okay. It's okay to laugh
once in a while.

760
00:41:30,067 --> 00:41:31,967
You can be a happy person.

761
00:41:39,234 --> 00:41:40,433
This is Bauer.

762
00:41:40,434 --> 00:41:41,532
It's Hastings.

763
00:41:41,533 --> 00:41:42,933
Our team's at the truck stop.

764
00:41:42,934 --> 00:41:44,166
The nuclear rods are not there.

765
00:41:44,167 --> 00:41:47,267
What? H-Hold on. Say that again.

766
00:41:47,301 --> 00:41:50,834
I said the rods
are not there.

767
00:41:50,867 --> 00:41:51,899
That's not possible.

768
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,367
Did your men go
to the right place?

769
00:41:53,368 --> 00:41:54,766
They went exactly where
you sent them.

770
00:41:54,767 --> 00:41:56,934
Now stop playing games
and tell us where the rods are.

771
00:41:56,967 --> 00:41:59,468
I told you, they were there.

772
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:01,166
I had two
of my men guarding them.

773
00:42:01,167 --> 00:42:02,833
We found their bodies,
both shot.

774
00:42:02,834 --> 00:42:04,066
And there was something else.

775
00:42:04,067 --> 00:42:05,532
Some kind
of necklace hanging

776
00:42:05,533 --> 00:42:07,233
on the inside
of the truck's door.

777
00:42:07,234 --> 00:42:08,899
Like someone wanted
to send a message.

778
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:10,800
What kind of a necklace?

779
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,767
A gold cross.

780
00:42:14,167 --> 00:42:16,500
What does that mean?

781
00:42:18,301 --> 00:42:20,201
Josef.

782
00:42:24,301 --> 00:42:25,632
I have the fuel rods.

783
00:42:25,633 --> 00:42:28,301
Really?

784
00:42:28,334 --> 00:42:29,666
I wasn't sure I believed, Josef,

785
00:42:29,667 --> 00:42:31,166
that you would betray
your father.

786
00:42:31,167 --> 00:42:33,434
You were upset that he was
holding up delivery

787
00:42:33,468 --> 00:42:35,633
of the rods;
now I've gotten them for you.

788
00:42:35,667 --> 00:42:37,767
It won't take him long
to realize what's happened,

789
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,100
so let's get
this done fast.

790
00:42:39,101 --> 00:42:40,200
You're worried
he'll discover

791
00:42:40,201 --> 00:42:41,566
you've replaced him
as our partner.

792
00:42:41,567 --> 00:42:44,567
No, I want my father to know.

793
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,834
In fact,
I made sure he will.

794
00:42:46,867 --> 00:42:48,333
When will you get here?

795
00:42:48,334 --> 00:42:49,966
Less than five minutes.

796
00:42:49,967 --> 00:42:52,067
Just have my money ready.

797
00:42:57,225 --> 00:43:02,884
