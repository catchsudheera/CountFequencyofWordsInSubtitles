1
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,435
How soon can we deploy once we arrive?

2
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:18,592
It will take us two hours
to assemble the delivery system

3
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,752
and another hour to install the bomb.

4
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,068
Longer than I'd hoped.

5
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:28,792
Remember, without us you'd be delivering
your payload in weeks instead of hours.

6
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:34,159
If we succeed today, the Arabs and the West
will destroy each other.

7
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:38,711
- Did you pick up anything on Gredenko?
- No. Glasgow Street house was deserted.

8
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:39,915
I might have a lead.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,672
- What is it?
- Charles Logan.

10
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,433
Logan? He's at his retreat under house arrest.

11
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,875
So, you need Gredenko to find Fayed.

12
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,154
Can you help us?

13
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,629
I never dealt with him directly,
but I know how we can find him.

14
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,312
- How?
- Anatoly Markov.

15
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,789
He's the Russian consul general
in Los Angeles.

16
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,279
I don't trust you.

17
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,158
If you wanna find Gredenko,
maybe it's time you started.

18
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:03,916
- You're taking a great risk, Mr President.
- You and I both share in that risk, sir.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,468
We have three nuclear weapons
loose in my country.

20
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,597
I want a statement of support
from your prime minister,

21
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,398
right on the heels of Assad's.

22
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:16,031
A public endorsement could have grave
political consequences for the prime minister.

23
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,509
Tell your prime minister
we have a carrier group

24
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,353
operating less than 25 miles off his shores.

25
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,749
It's armed.

26
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:30,116
The president's gonna die.
There's nothing you can do about it.

27
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,156
You've got to put a stop to this.

28
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,674
There must have been a moment
when you were on board.

29
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,637
Did you change your mind?

30
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,790
I need to know.

31
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,519
I was against you from the start.

32
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,795
You're just as bad as Fayed.

33
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,270
All right.
Here we go for a run-through, everyone.

34
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,157
What is this? Bomb!

35
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,115
Citadel has been hit. Send a medical team.

36
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,397
Citadel is down. Send a medical team now.

37
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,594
<i>(man) This is Hawkins. We've reached
emergency med bay with the president.</i>

38
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:15,276
<i>(Lowry) I want you to stay posted outside.
Understood?</i>

39
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,318
<i>- (man) Sir.
- I've got it. Thank you.</i>

40
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,755
Let me be clear about this before we go.

41
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:37,789
You are a federal prisoner. Do not make
a move unless I tell you to, understand?

42
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,952
You don't have to threaten me, Jack.
I know what my role is.

43
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,917
I just want to be of service.

44
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,070
As far as I'm concerned,

45
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,994
you'll never do anything
that will erase what you've already done.

46
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,753
I understand your anger, I do,

47
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,833
but if you wanna find Gredenko,
we should leave now.

48
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,391
Get in the car.

49
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,872
I haven't been outside these gates
in over a year...

50
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:29,031
You don't need me
to tell you what it's like to be locked up.

51
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,475
You're right, I don't.

52
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,393
I know how it feels to be locked away
from the rest of the world.

53
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,948
Lonely...

54
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,474
the silence...

55
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,279
It plays with your sanity.

56
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:51,798
But in that silence you can hear
the voice of your deepest self.

57
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:56,078
And if you listen to that voice,
you have a chance to heal.

58
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,628
<i>(phone rings)</i>

59
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,237
- Bauer.
- Bill. Are you on your way to the consulate?

60
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,309
<i>Yes.</i>

61
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,349
You need to know something. There was an
assassination attempt on President Palmer.

62
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,034
<i>He was wounded,
but we don't know the extent yet.</i>

63
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,998
Oh, my God. How did this happen?

64
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:20,868
The details are still coming in.
Secret Service thinks it was Assad.

65
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:24,919
<i>- What?
- They think he smuggled in a device.</i>

66
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,834
That doesn't make sense. Assad was
working with the president to stop Fayed.

67
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,831
- So he said.
- He wasn't lying.

68
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,957
He's dead, Jack.
It doesn't matter if it was him or not.

69
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,917
He can't help us stop Fayed,

70
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,958
which means
you're following our only live lead.

71
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,430
I understand. I'll get back to you
as soon as I'm at the consulate.

72
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,750
What happened?

73
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,231
There was an assassination attempt
on Wayne Palmer.

74
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:56,637
<i>- (woman) Replace it.
- (man) Good. Get rid of that.</i>

75
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,315
Make sure you count and bag the shrapnel...

76
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,434
- Excuse me, Mr Pollock.
- Yes. What do you want?

77
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:26,150
The vice president is being telebriefed.
The sec dep wants Mr Lennox there.

78
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,836
Well, Mr Lennox is occupied.
I'm covering for him.

79
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:33,229
Dr Welton is monitoring medical teams.

80
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:38,075
I've asked him to brief us directly
on the president's condition.

81
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,116
<i>- Mr Vice President.
- Go ahead.</i>

82
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,236
We're stabilising the president.

83
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,915
He was hit by shrapnel
which entered his upper chest and neck.

84
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,753
He didn't suffer head wounds,
but he is unconscious.

85
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:52,116
<i>Can you determine
when he might be able to resume his duties?</i>

86
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:56,239
Sir, the president was within ten feet
of a high-velocity explosive device.

87
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:00,199
<i>That he survived at all is... a miracle.</i>

88
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,509
Mr Vice President, as secretary of defense,
I am the ranking member of this committee.

89
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,149
And I think I can speak
for all of us when I say...

90
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:17,509
we have no way of knowing when or if
the president will recover enough to function.

91
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,229
<i>We need to proceed under the assumption</i>

92
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:25,438
<i>that the president's duties are now yours.</i>

93
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,874
<i>I'll be landing in a few minutes.
When I get there,</i>

94
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,793
<i>I want a full security briefing
from Tom Lennox.</i>

95
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:47,156
<i>Yes, sir. We'll see you here soon.</i>

96
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,714
Please submit your task profiles to my office.

97
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:00,590
We'll reconvene when
the vice president gets here. Reed.

98
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,195
- Where the hell is Tom Lennox?
- I believe he's with the attorney general.

99
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,874
I spoke with the AG.
He's had no contact with him.

100
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,599
Hm... Well, then, I... I'm not sure.

101
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,955
You work for the man
but don't know where he is?

102
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:20,558
President Palmer was expecting him in
the broadcast studio and he didn't show up.

103
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:28,553
Tom Lennox is missing.
Have your team sweep the bunker. Find him.

104
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,232
Yes, sir.

105
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:35,599
10-20 on Tom Lennox.
This is a priority request from the sec dep.

106
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,710
You had the clarity to understand
how to keep this country safe.

107
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,191
But the president was an obstacle.
We did what was necessary.

108
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,636
Is he dead?

109
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,353
No, but he's injured badly enough
that he won't be able to serve.

110
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,035
Secret Service is looking for Lennox.
They're sweeping the bunker.

111
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,156
- Let me handle him.
- No.

112
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,754
I told you before,
I can make it look like a suicide.

113
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,231
The situation supports it. He was depressed
after the president rejected his plan...

114
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,153
- No. We cannot kill Tom Lennox.
- Why not?

115
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,754
Because we're not murderers.

116
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,549
What we did was necessary
for the sake of national security.

117
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:32,031
Killing Lennox is just about us
trying to cover our involvement.

118
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,440
Getting caught? Never part of the plan.

119
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,312
Don't touch him.

120
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,152
Or what?

121
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,949
Or you'll have to kill me too.

122
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,711
Listen, I know Tom Lennox.

123
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,712
He can be reasoned with.

124
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:11,188
- So you really did it?
- Only because it had to be done.

125
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:15,758
You were the one who warned us all
that the logic of this current engagement

126
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,751
would demand extreme action.

127
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:21,674
You said, for the greater good,
individuals would need to be sacrificed.

128
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,116
I wasn't referring
to the President of the United States.

129
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,954
Sir, the president's policies
would have aided the enemy.

130
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,628
They were well-intentioned, but they were
naive and dangerous, and you know that.

131
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,553
Vice President Daniels
is running this country now.

132
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,438
He will implement your security plan.

133
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:46,513
But if you implicate us,
it will only drag you into this,

134
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,068
and it will make your plan
harder to push through.

135
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:52,709
I'm the one who tried to stop you, Reed.

136
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,553
They'll never believe you.

137
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,749
The only way to stop these nuclear
weapons being detonated on US soil

138
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:04,196
is through the proposals
in your security plan.

139
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,794
And all I have to do is do nothing?

140
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,108
Yes.

141
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:14,759
Carson has matched the bomb signature
to a design used by Assad's organisation.

142
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,638
The FBI will put this all on Assad.

143
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:23,268
- No one needs to know the truth.
- I don't know.

144
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:29,196
Sir, a guilty conscience is a fair price to pay
for the survival of this country.

145
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,597
They're coming.

146
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:38,832
- Do you understand the situation, sir?
- I do understand, Reed.

147
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:42,117
I know that you will do the right thing.

148
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,270
Good.

149
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,835
I'm gonna cut him loose.

150
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:07,590
- Mr Lennox, are you all right?
- Yes, Agent Lowry.

151
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,798
Sir, the secretary of defense
has been looking for you.

152
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,315
Lowry, these men are responsible
for the attempted assassination.

153
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:27,633
I'm surrendering myself until I talk to the
attorney general, but I want them arrested.

154
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,076
- Welcome back, sir.
- Thank you, Lisa.

155
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,152
I've sifted through
the latest flashes you need to look at.

156
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:58,437
I went over them.
I want to follow up on the one from CTU.

157
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:01,034
I'll get them on the line.

158
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,874
<i>- (man) CTU.
- I have the vice president for Mr Buchanan.</i>

159
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,235
<i>Hold, please.</i>

160
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,311
<i>(phone rings)</i>

161
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,958
- This is Bill Buchanan.
- Sir, one moment for the vice president.

162
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,472
I see from the White House flashes

163
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:25,189
that President Palmer
granted Charles Logan some kind of furlough.

164
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:29,876
I'm curious as to what circumstances
could possibly have led to that.

165
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,633
Logan claims
he can help us find Dmitri Gredenko,

166
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,075
the man who supplied terrorists with nukes.

167
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,628
- How?
- Through the Russian consul.

168
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:42,111
Logan believes this man can find Gredenko.
He insisted on approaching the consul.

169
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,112
I'm surprised
President Palmer trusted Charles Logan

170
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,794
to conduct any business for the government.

171
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:52,351
I believe the president's decision was
informed by the fact we have no active leads.

172
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:56,194
- Is Logan being supervised?
- Yes. By one of our agents, Jack Bauer.

173
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,475
Bauer will keep Logan on a short leash.

174
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,916
You keep me posted to any progress.

175
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,719
As soon as this plays out,
I want him back under arrest.

176
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,789
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

177
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,149
Come with me into the consulate,
but I need to speak to Markov alone.

178
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,515
- Don't leave my sight.
- Then this is a waste.

179
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,239
He won't tell us
what we need to know if you're there.

180
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:23,394
- I don't let you out of my sight.
- What do you think I'll do, request asylum?

181
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:28,395
If it's any comfort,
I don't think the Russians would take me.

182
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:35,030
Fine. You can talk to the consul on your own,
but I will be right outside the door.

183
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:39,796
You try and move more than
20 feet away from me, and I will know.

184
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:45,556
I'm gonna prove you wrong, Jack.
I'm only trying to help.

185
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:56,594
The consul is expecting you, Mr President.
Follow me, please.

186
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,071
<i>(knock at door)</i>

187
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,750
- Mr President.
- Anatoly.

188
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,070
- It's good to see you.
- It's a pleasure, sir.

189
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,276
How have you been?

190
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,591
Very well.
Still trying to do my best for my country,

191
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,989
as much as circumstances will allow.

192
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,674
Of course.

193
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:24,311
My sincere sympathies to your people
for the tragedy this morning.

194
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:29,030
You have the condolences and support
of my country.

195
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,680
Thank you.

196
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,194
Now...

197
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,794
how can I help you?

198
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,430
The bomb that exploded
was a Russian suitcase nuclear device,

199
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:45,115
supplied to the terrorists by Dmitri Gredenko.

200
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,317
No, thank you. I don't smoke any more.

201
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:07,600
Mr President, those weapons
were destroyed as part of our treaty.

202
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,148
We're certain of our facts, Anatoly.

203
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,312
But I didn't come here to make accusations.

204
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:17,791
I came here because
we need to know where Gredenko is.

205
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:21,555
I will ask Moscow
to try to locate him immediately.

206
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:24,518
I'm not asking Moscow, I'm asking you.

207
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:33,109
I know that you are close, and you have been
since you fought together in Afghanistan.

208
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:37,751
So, I ask again, where is he?

209
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,879
I don't know.

210
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:46,635
Dmitri and I were close for many years,
but not now.

211
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,472
Forgive my lack of diplomacy,
but I don't believe you,

212
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,199
and I'm willing to force the issue.

213
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:57,913
Moscow has always suspected
that someone inside the Russian government

214
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,870
helped supply the Sentox nerve gas
to the separatists two years ago.

215
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:08,991
I have the tapes, Anatoly,
of every phone call you made to my people.

216
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:12,629
I will send them to President Suvarov.

217
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:18,108
You gave me your word
that my role would remain secret.

218
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,270
My promise was rendered null and void

219
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:25,514
by the fact that the terrorists that Gredenko
is helping have three more bombs.

220
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,878
I haven't spoken to Gredenko
for more than one year.

221
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:34,875
I will send the tapes. You will be recalled to
Moscow and you will never be heard of again.

222
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:39,238
You can send all the tapes you like,

223
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,470
destroy me many times over.

224
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:45,348
I do not know where Gredenko is.

225
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:56,316
All right, Anatoly. I believe you.

226
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,595
Please forgive my tactics.

227
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,638
I'm trying to save people's lives.

228
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:12,196
So, if you know anyone else who might
still be in contact with Gredenko...

229
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,038
I will make calls.

230
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:24,429
But, as far as I know,

231
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:28,115
everyone else
has cut off contact with Dmitri as well.

232
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,395
Any support would be greatly appreciated.

233
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,869
Of course.

234
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,552
Anatoly.

235
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,631
Mr President.

236
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,351
We're moving.

237
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,959
He says he hasn't
spoken to Gredenko in a year.

238
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:02,237
He's lying. They're still in contact.

239
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:06,279
And he knows enough
about what's going on to want to deny that.

240
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,158
- How do you know?
- Cos I've done enough lying myself

241
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,754
to be familiar with the signs.

242
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:19,398
<i>- (phone rings)
- Yes?</i>

243
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:22,677
<i>(Markov) The United States
has connected you with terrorists.</i>

244
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,510
Are you sure?

245
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,434
They sent Charles Logan to try and force me
to give up your location.

246
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:32,514
The reason we brought the Arabs into this
was to conceal our involvement.

247
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,909
Now we are exposed. Russia is exposed.

248
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,230
The Americans are speculating.

249
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:41,598
They have no evidence.
If they did, they would not send Logan.

250
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:44,592
- I don't know.
- Don't worry, Dmitri.

251
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:48,673
By the time they find anything,
it will be too late.

252
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:52,548
All right.
Let me know if you hear anything more.

253
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,958
Pull over as soon
as you're out of sight of the guards.

254
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,508
What are you going to do?

255
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,591
<i>(phone rings)</i>

256
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:13,355
- O'Brian.
- It's Jack. Gain access to the DWP server.

257
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,558
I want you to disable the power going
to the Russian consulate as soon as you can.

258
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,871
Chloe, you need to do this under the radar.

259
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,190
- How long do you need it out for?
- 60 seconds.

260
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:27,398
Make it look like a grid failure in case
the consulate tries to contact the DWP.

261
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,074
I'll get back to you when I'm ready.

262
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,753
Are you going back in there?

263
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,593
You just spent
nearly two years in a Chinese prison

264
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:39,513
because you violated
the sovereignty of their consulate.

265
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:45,072
Now you'll go into the Russian consulate
and take a chance on that happening again?

266
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,749

00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,317
Still at the airport waiting for my plane.
Why? What's up?

273
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,233
There's been an attempt
on President Palmer's life.

274
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,639
What?

275
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:28,794
They won't know the full extent of his injuries
until he regains consciousness.

276
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:33,556
- There's been nothing of this in the news.
- It hasn't been made public yet.

277
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:39,112
The vice president is on his way back to the
White House. He's assumed executive duties.

278
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,713
- I have to go back.
- You've already tendered your resignation.

279
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:49,157
Nothing's been processed.
Technically, I can withdraw my resignation.

280
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,310
<i>I've got to go back, Bill.</i>

281
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,475
Look, I'll call you when I get there, OK?

282
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,152
All right.

283
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:00,550
Once we settle in, I wanna
go over a copy of the Lennox proposal.

284
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,030
I need you to work up a distribution list.

285
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,998
The president rejected that plan.

286
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,799
What's your point?

287
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,359
Don't you think
it might be too soon to enact it?

288
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,668
<i>(sighs)</i>

289
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:25,357
Lisa, a Muslim terrorist has
set off a bomb inside the White House.

290
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:29,000
If anything, we've delayed this far too long.

291
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,476
- Mr Vice President.
- Hello, Ethan.

292
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:41,189
- What's the president's condition?
- They managed to stabilise him,

293
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,511
but it's still too soon to make a prognosis.

294
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,553
Something else has come up.

295
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:58,630
There's been a development in the
investigation of the assassination attempt.

296
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:03,271
Tom Lennox has
remanded himself into custody.

297
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:07,239
Lennox? What are you talking about?

298
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,031
Just about two hours ago.

299
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,112
That's when Reed
first hinted that there was a plot.

300
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,668
You waited an hour
before you tried to report it.

301
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:19,912
Because there was nothing actionable.
It was just all innuendo.

302
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,516
I was simply trying to wait and find out more.
By the time I realised they were moving,

303
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,114
Reed caught me trying to alert Hollister.

304
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,317
- That's when he struck you over the head?
- That's correct.

305
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,551
- So, when you provided Carson's clearance...
- No, no!

306
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:37,838
I didn't provide anybody clearance.
Reed stole my clearance card.

307
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:41,799
...and gave these men the president's itinerary,
you were pretending?

308
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,393
Yes.

309
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:50,113
Or maybe it's just
that you had second thoughts.

310
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:00,116
- I'd like to speak to Mr Lennox alone, please.
- Yes, sir.

311
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:13,593
I tried to stop this, Noah.

312
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:16,319
I'd like to believe you, Tom.

313
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,439
I'll leave it to the Justice Department
to determine your role, and Assad's.

314
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:23,956
Assad? They were setting him up.
He had nothing to do with this.

315
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:26,429
You don't know that.

316
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:29,990
It's my understanding
you suggested that others,

317
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,833
besides Reed and Carson,
may have been involved.

318
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:35,115
Only because Reed implied as much.

319
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,839
I was trying to figure out
who else was involved.

320
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,275
- Did you?
- No.

321
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:43,830
Then it's conceivable that Assad
may have been, at the very least,

322
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,990
a willing participant in this attack.

323
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,913
That makes no sense whatsoever.

324
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,198
Assad was a terrorist who hated this country
and everything it stands for.

325
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:58,070
What better way to rally his people than to
martyr himself by murdering the president?

326
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:02,472
Don't you understand? That is exactly what
Reed and Carson wanted this to look like,

327
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:05,279
and now you're playing right into it.

328
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:09,990
I am going to address the nation shortly
to inform the public about what's happened.

329
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:15,473
Until I have all the facts, I am not about to tell
them that Hamri Al-Assad is innocent in this.

330
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,192
I see what you're doing here, Noah.

331
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:29,557
By scapegoating Assad,
you can reverse the agenda,

332
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:34,077
get aggressive with the Islamic community.
You think I don't see what you're doing here?

333
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:37,914
It's your plan, Tom.
You outlined those measures yourself.

334
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,639
I was your staunchest advocate.

335
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:49,716
What has happened
to the president is horrific,

336
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:53,918
but if there is any good to come from this,

337
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,752
it's that we have the opportunity

338
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:59,310
to do what we know is in
the best interests of protecting this country.

339
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,834
You're asking a whole heck of a lot more

340
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:05,469
than for me just to maintain silence on Assad.

341
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:08,358
The cabinet knows
you are the architect of the plan.

342
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:11,352
If you're not on the face of it now,
it may raise questions.

343
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:15,752
Or have you come to believe the president
was correct in rejecting your proposals?

344
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,877
No. I know it's... it's the only way
to stop these attacks.

345
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:24,830
But you're gonna stick to your assertion
of Assad's complete innocence?

346
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:30,040
Or I can clear you of these charges
and you can help me to initiate your plan,

347
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:34,113
which we both know
is in the best interests of the country.

348
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,951
Agent Lowry.

349
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:58,708
I don't want his statement promoted to the
attorney general until it's gone through me.

350
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,028
Yes, sir.

351
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,511
<i>(phone buzzes)</i>

352
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,119
- Have you got it?
- I've logged onto the DWP server.

353
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,590
You have a 60-second window
before the circuits kick back in.

354
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,955
Hold on.

355
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,149
Shut it down now.

356
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,039
- What is happening?
- I don't know. Something's wrong.

357
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:24,238
<i>- You check the upper level, I check the lower.
- Got it. (speaks Russian)</i>

358
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,835
- What is this?
- Hands where I can see them.

359
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:35,036
- Why are you here?
- Where is Gredenko?

360
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,156
- I told him, I don't know.
- You're lying.

361
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,515
<i>- (alarm)
- Hands away from the desk now!</i>

362
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,953
Sit down!

363
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:46,678
You're breaking international law,
violating the sovereignty of the consulate.

364
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,874
I don't have time to ask nicely.
Where's Gredenko?

365
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,712
I... I don't know. I swear.

366
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,077
<i>- (speaks Russian)
- I'm not sure.</i>

367
00:27:56,160 --> 00:28:00,597
When the power came back on,
the consul's panic button was triggered.

368
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,511
Consul Markov. Are you all right?

369
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:09,194
I've taken the consul hostage at gunpoint.

370
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:13,671
You make any attempt to enter this room,
I will kill him. You understand me?

371
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:17,548
<i>- Find out who this man is, and alert Moscow.
- (speaks Russian)</i>

372
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:28,354
<i>- (woman) CTU, Operations.
- It's Jack. Let me speak to Buchanan.</i>

373
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,351
<i>Jack Bauer on line one.</i>

374
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,397
- What's going on, Jack?
- Bill, I got a situation.

375
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,392
Logan's play didn't work
so I came back to the consulate.

376
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:40,790
Before I could get any information from him,
I was discovered.

377
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,519
I don't know how much more time I've got.

378
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,273
It's Russian territory. I can't sanction this.

379
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:49,511
I know. You need to call the White House
and advise them.

380
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,795
I want you to stand down, find a way out.

381
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:54,713
I'm not going
until Markov tells me how to find Gredenko.

382
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,519
I'll get back to you when I've got something.

383
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:43,029
Mr Vice President, the press secretary
has set up for your address.

384
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,190
You'll be going live in ten minutes.

385
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:49,637
Thank you, Lisa.
Have you... finished drafting my statement?

386
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:52,154
I'll have it for you momentarily.

387
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:56,028
I thought you should know that
Karen Hayes has withdrawn her resignation.

388
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,315
She's on her way here now.

389
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,312
Do you know what prompted her resignation?

390
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:05,109
Officially, it was to return to Los Angeles
to be with her husband,

391
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:11,070
but rumour has it she stepped down
because of her opposition to the Lennox plan.

392
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:14,789
<i>- I see.
- (man) I have Bill Buchanan on the line.</i>

393
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,595
- This is the vice president.
- Sir, a situation has developed.

394
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,636
What kind of situation?

395
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:24,393
Jack Bauer has taken
Russian Consul Markov hostage.

396
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:28,917
- He's holding him at gunpoint.
- What? How could that happen?

397
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,835
Markov denied having any contact with
Gredenko, but Logan insisted he was lying.

398
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,992
When the escort left,
Bauer went back to question Markov.

399
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,957
That's when he was discovered.

400
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,678
My God.

401
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:47,873
- Did you approve these actions?
- No, sir. Bauer acted on his own authority.

402
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:50,793
And the questionable assumption
of Charles Logan.

403
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:55,032
Sir, Bauer has absolutely no reason
to trust Charles Logan,

404
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,395
yet he was convinced enough to take action.

405
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,040
In any event, he's created a diplomatic mess.

406
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:04,238
If Markov has information,
then extracting it is our only chance

407
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,551
to stop the next nuke from being detonated.

408
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,789
- Excuse me.
- Not now.

409
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,757
Sir, it's President Suvarov.

410
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:18,718
Bill, I don't know how long
I can hold off the Russians.

411
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:22,839
If Markov is connected to these nukes,
Bauer had better get it out of him fast.

412
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:25,115
Yes, sir.

413
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:38,472
Mr President, this is Vice President Daniels.

414
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,915
I was expecting to speak to President Palmer.

415
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,198
- My apologies. I'm afraid he's unavailable.
- Unavailable?

416
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,635
Sir, I'm speaking on his authority.

417
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:51,269
I assume that you're calling
about the incident at your consulate.

418
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,874
Let me assure you,
this man is acting on his own

419
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:57,032
and not under the orders
of the United States government.

420
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:00,556
Nevertheless,
this is a gross violation of our sovereignty.

421
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:04,679
<i>If your agent does not stand down
immediately, my country will have no choice</i>

422
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:09,675
<i>but to retaliate with the most forceful
diplomatic measures at our disposal.</i>

423
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:14,754
I understand your position, but before you
escalate this you should understand mine.

424
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:19,516
We've learned that Consul Markov is
most likely in contact with Dmitri Gredenko,

425
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:23,309
who we've linked to the nuclear attack
that took place on US soil.

426
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:29,157
If that's true... we will look upon him
as a co-conspirator in the attack.

427
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:35,110
Mr Vice President, I deeply regret the tragedy
that your country has experienced today,

428
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:39,432
but you must make these charges
through proper diplomatic channels

429
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,590
after your agent has surrendered.

430
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:48,075
I wanna know
where Gredenko is and what he's doing.

431
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,833
I don't know.

432
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:56,517
I haven't spoken to Gredenko
since he arrived in the United States.

433
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,629
I never said he was in the United States.

434
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:07,958
Why don't I tell you what we know?

435
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:12,272
We already know that Gredenko
supplied Fayed with the five suitcase nukes.

436
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:17,673
It doesn't make sense that he's still involved,
unless he's doing something else for Fayed.

437
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,910
That's what we wanna know.

438
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,275
What is Gredenko doing for Fayed?!

439
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,832
I don't know.

440
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:31,909
You're gonna tell me what I want to know,
or you're gonna start losing your fingers.

441
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,070
This is your last chance.

442
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:42,111
<i>(crunching sound)</i>

443
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,676
<i>(Vasili) I've got the feed.</i>

444
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,955
Don't move in yet. He's too close to Markov.

445
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,238
You have one of two choices...

446
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:02,030
You can give me the information that I want
and I'll go pick up Gredenko...

447
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:06,079
or I can kill you
and I'll make sure Gredenko finds out.

448
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:10,312
And he'll panic, because he'll think
you gave him up before you died.

449
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,118
He'll be forced to use his exit route.

450
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:16,113
Either way, he stops
what he's doing in this country now.

451
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:18,395
The choice is yours.

452
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,230
How do I find Gredenko?

453
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,279
Mohave Desert. Shadow Valley.

454
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,749
- Where in the Shadow Valley?
- I don't know.

455
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,671
What is he doing?

456
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,320
What is he doing?!

457
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,152
Launching drones.

458
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,389
What?

459
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,233
Aerial drones for Fayed.

460
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,551
His delivery system for nuclear bombs.

461
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,428
How soon will the drones be ready?

462
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,953
Two hours.

463
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:55,828
In two hours, all the bombs will be in the air.

464
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:58,796
Son of a bitch!

465
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,996
<i>(Vasili) Now!</i>

466
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:20,269
Don't let anyone near this man,
do you understand?

467
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:40,833
My fellow Americans,
I regret to inform you that a short time ago,

468
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:45,675
President Palmer was seriously injured in an
assassination attempt at the White House.

469
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:50,629
Thankfully, he is alive
and currently in a stable condition.

470
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:54,633
The prime suspect, Hamri Al-Assad,
was killed in the explosion.

471
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:59,840
And in light of this heinous and cowardly act,
compounded by the tragedy in California,

472
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:04,710
I will be pushing forward
an aggressive agenda of national security.

473
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,353
<i>One that will, out of necessity,</i>

474
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:11,671
<i>suspend certain civil liberties.</i>

475
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:15,433
<i>This is the price of war.</i>

476
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,909
<i>Make no mistake,</i>

477
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,719
<i>that is exactly what this is.</i>

478
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:25,032
- Have you been able to reach Jack?
- No, but my log confirms he did try to call in.

479
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:27,588
Are we monitoring
consulate communications?

480
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:31,036
We are, but diplomatic traffic
is encrypted with algorithm

481
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:34,556
that we've never been able to crack.
But I think I have a way around it.

482
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,279
One of the computers
isn't properly shielded,

483
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:40,909
so I'm picking up a shadow of their messages
before they're encrypted.

484
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,479
- What's that?
- ASCll code.

485
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:45,597
- It is?
- Yeah, in Russian. I'll just load a Cyrillic grid.

486
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,398
Should be good to go.

487
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,596
<i>(mutters in Russian)</i>

488
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:56,076
Oh, no. They're saying they've got
an American agent in custody.

489
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,833
<i>...forceful and decisive action
needs to be taken...</i>

490
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:01,434
<i>(phone rings)</i>

491
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:07,034
- Buchanan.
- Morris just intercepted some bandwidth.

492
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:11,588
- Apparently, they got to Jack.
- What do you mean, "got to" him?

493
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:15,355
They moved in on his position
and recovered Markov.

494
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,477
<i>Sir, they're holding Jack prisoner.</i>

495
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:23,989
- Sir, we should phone the vice president.
- No. No, not yet.

496
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,989
He's in a diplomatic standoff with Suvarov.

497
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,878
He won't get anywhere with a direct appeal.

498
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:34,474
So what's our next move?

499
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:39,434
Have special ops draw up a plan
to get into the consulate.

500
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:44,116
I wanna give the vice president
the option to take the consul by force

501
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,792
and hopefully rescue Jack.

502
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:49,476
<i>(speaking Russian)</i>

503
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,714
<i>- (speaks Russian)
- Enough.</i>

504
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:06,439
- You must listen.
- I'm not allowed to talk to you.

505
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:09,876
That's because your consul
doesn't want you to hear what I know.

506
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:15,080
Dmitri Gredenko was responsible for
supplying terrorists with the nuclear bomb.

507
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:18,835
Markov is working with him,
against the orders of your government.

508
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:22,071
You can make allegations
through appropriate channels.

509
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:26,153
No, there's not enough time.
Gredenko has three more bombs.

510
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:29,630
They're gonna find targets
by way of unmanned drone aircraft.

511
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:32,188
With the consul's knowledge? Ridiculous.

512
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,953
- He told me. He confessed.
- Under duress.

513
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:39,158
He gave me his location. The aircraft
will be ready to launch within two hours.

514
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:42,038
I know you believe me.

515
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:46,193
You know about
Markov's connection to Gredenko.

516
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:49,317
Please. You have to help.

517
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:55,271
There is nothing I can do. The consul
approves communications to Moscow.

518
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:58,113
I don't want you to call Moscow,
I want you to call CTU.

519
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:03,149
I want you to give them Gredenko's location
and advise them of the time frame.

520
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:08,395
- Where is he?
- The High Desert, in the Shadow Valley.

521
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:14,116
You need to call 310-597-3781.

522
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:18,398
You need to tell them you have
a message for Bill Buchanan from me.

523
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:21,074
My name is Jack Bauer.

524
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,151
Please.

525
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:28,517
I hope you are telling me the truth,
for your sake as well as mine.

526
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:33,720
You know I am, otherwise
you wouldn't even consider doing this.

527
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,995
You need to hurry.

528
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:16,836
<i>- (man) CTU.
- I need to speak to Bill Buchanan.</i>

529
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:19,480
<i>Mr Buchanan is in a meeting.
Can I take a message?</i>

530
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,869
<i>- It's urgent.
- One moment, please.</i>

531
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:32,276
<i>(man) Mr Buchanan, there's a man on the line
from the consulate. He says it's urgent.</i>

532
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:35,397
This is Bill Buchanan.

533
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,993
Hello?

534
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,591
