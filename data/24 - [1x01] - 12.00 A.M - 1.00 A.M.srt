1
00:01:40,293 --> 00:01:41,931
- Identify.
- Victor Rovner.

2
00:01:42,013 --> 00:01:45,005
- Requesting permission to transmit.
- Log in.

3
00:01:54,653 --> 00:01:56,689
Permission granted.

4
00:02:17,973 --> 00:02:19,964
Excuse me.

5
00:02:23,253 --> 00:02:24,049
This is Walsh.

6
00:02:24,133 --> 00:02:27,808
We just heard from Rovner. He confirmed
that there will be an attempt today.

7
00:02:27,893 --> 00:02:31,966
- Did he find out who the target is?
- Senator David Palmer.

8
00:02:39,573 --> 00:02:42,246
I hate this.
"On this historic occasion"?

9
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:45,325
Well, it is an historic occasion, sir.

10
00:02:45,413 --> 00:02:49,929
But it's self-serving to say it.
I wanna stay low-key.

11
00:02:50,013 --> 00:02:52,811
Wrong. Play it up, inspire people.

12
00:02:54,373 --> 00:02:57,285
- Honey, what do you think?
- I agree with Patty.

13
00:03:00,693 --> 00:03:04,288
OK, but not "occasion".
Sounds like we're having brunch.

14
00:03:04,373 --> 00:03:06,364
"On this historic day"?

15
00:03:06,453 --> 00:03:07,488
Deal.

16
00:03:08,373 --> 00:03:10,568
- You going to bed?
- How can I sleep?

17
00:03:10,653 --> 00:03:14,532
No, I'm gonna write a few thank yous,
and you call me if you need me.

18
00:03:14,613 --> 00:03:16,888
Thank you, angel.

19
00:03:17,493 --> 00:03:21,281
- You're in trouble, Dad.
- Really?

20
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:24,449
Yeah.

21
00:03:27,213 --> 00:03:29,090
So...

22
00:03:29,173 --> 00:03:35,692
- is she still giving you the cold shoulder?
- If by "she" you are referring to your mother,

23
00:03:35,773 --> 00:03:39,527
I'd appreciate it if you'd
call her by her name - Mom.

24
00:03:39,973 --> 00:03:43,045
- And, no, she's just busy.
- She's busy a lot.

25
00:03:43,893 --> 00:03:47,044
And it's a school night
for you, so time for bed.

26
00:03:50,773 --> 00:03:53,162
- Good night.
- I love you.

27
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:03,171
I'm glad you moved back in, Daddy.

28
00:04:05,653 --> 00:04:08,690
Me too, sweet. Have a good sleep.

29
00:04:14,093 --> 00:04:16,687
- Night, sweet pea.
- Yeah.

30
00:04:23,973 --> 00:04:26,487
She still giving you a hard time?

31
00:04:26,573 --> 00:04:31,283
I don't know when I became the enemy.
I think she blames me for you moving out.

32
00:04:31,373 --> 00:04:33,807
I never gave her any reason to.

33
00:04:33,893 --> 00:04:35,884
Maybe not.

34
00:04:37,293 --> 00:04:40,012
I think you let her manipulate you, Jack.

35
00:04:41,053 --> 00:04:42,566
No, I don't.

36
00:04:42,653 --> 00:04:45,247
Let me guess. Just now
she was sweetness and light?

37
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:48,803
- Then she said something nasty about me.
- And I just busted her on it.

38
00:04:48,893 --> 00:04:54,570
I don't know why you take this so personally.
It's just that mother-teenage daughter thing.

39
00:04:54,653 --> 00:04:56,644
Hey...

40
00:04:59,253 --> 00:05:02,211
Maybe you're right.
Maybe we should talk to her right now.

41
00:05:02,293 --> 00:05:07,845
Tell her she can't play us off each other, that
if she's insulting you, she's insulting me too.

42
00:05:08,773 --> 00:05:11,526
- OK.
- Good.

43
00:05:11,613 --> 00:05:14,207
I really appreciate that.

44
00:05:18,813 --> 00:05:21,247
So you just said that you appreciate that.

45
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:24,131
- You kind of appreciate it?
- I really appreciate it.

46
00:05:24,213 --> 00:05:27,523
Do you really, really appreciate it?
You really appreciate it?

47
00:05:27,613 --> 00:05:30,844
- How much do you appreciate it?
- Jack.

48
00:05:30,933 --> 00:05:33,163
OK.

49
00:05:33,253 --> 00:05:35,244
Kim.

50
00:05:39,053 --> 00:05:41,044
Kim?

51
00:05:43,213 --> 00:05:45,204
Honey?

52
00:05:46,093 --> 00:05:48,084
(car drives off

53
00:05:52,373 --> 00:05:54,364
Kim!

54
00:05:55,973 --> 00:05:57,964
She snuck out.

55
00:05:58,053 --> 00:06:01,762
That's it. She's grounded
for two months. No exceptions.

56
00:06:01,853 --> 00:06:05,766
She can forget about
getting her driver's licence.

57
00:06:08,533 --> 00:06:10,285
- Hello?
- Teri, is Jack there?

58
00:06:10,373 --> 00:06:13,365
Yeah, he's right here. It's Nina.

59
00:06:13,453 --> 00:06:15,444
What? Hey, Nina.

60
00:06:16,733 --> 00:06:19,327
Now? No. No, I can't.

61
00:06:21,213 --> 00:06:23,204
Yeah.

62
00:06:24,173 --> 00:06:26,971
OK, fine. Get a hold of
the others and bring 'em in.

63
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:30,841
Yeah. OK. Bye. It's Walsh.
He's coming into the office.

64
00:06:30,933 --> 00:06:33,163
He wants everybody in as soon as possible.

65
00:06:33,253 --> 00:06:35,926
It's only a briefing.
I should be back within an hour.

66
00:06:36,013 --> 00:06:39,130
If she's not here when I get back,
we'll call all her friends,

67
00:06:39,213 --> 00:06:42,171
everyone we know,
until we find out where she's gone, OK?

68
00:06:42,253 --> 00:06:43,447
OK.

69
00:06:43,533 --> 00:06:45,524
I'm sorry.

70
00:06:46,293 --> 00:06:49,205
I'll call you from the road.

71
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:02,725
- Hello.
- Vincent.

72
00:07:02,813 --> 00:07:06,328
Jack Bauer. Are you planning
on seeing Kimberly tonight?

73
00:07:06,413 --> 00:07:11,043
- No, man, we broke up. You know that.
- I just want to make sure you know that.

74
00:07:11,133 --> 00:07:14,808
- Snuck out on ya, huh?
- Don't screw with me, Vincent.

75
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:18,203
Chill, man. Look, I don't know
where she's at. You got my word.

76
00:07:18,293 --> 00:07:22,332
That's a real comfort, Vincent.
Knowing that I've got your word.

77
00:07:33,573 --> 00:07:35,928
Why are we meeting
at a furniture store?

78
00:07:36,013 --> 00:07:39,608
- Dan works there.
- When are we supposed to be there?

79
00:07:39,693 --> 00:07:42,844
- Midnight. We're late.
- Yeah, they'll wait.

80
00:07:42,933 --> 00:07:44,889
You sure about that?

81
00:07:44,973 --> 00:07:48,966
Well, you told them I'm hot, right?
And you're hot, so they'll wait.

82
00:07:49,053 --> 00:07:51,851
Dan's a sophomore at San Diego State.

83
00:07:51,933 --> 00:07:54,163
Yeah, you told me that.

84
00:07:54,253 --> 00:08:00,010
And so is Rick. I mean, they're not just,
you know, a bunch of high-school idiots.

85
00:08:00,093 --> 00:08:03,722
- And your point is?
- They're men, not boys.

86
00:08:04,293 --> 00:08:07,330
- Good. I'm glad to hear it.
- Really?

87
00:08:07,813 --> 00:08:09,963
Yeah.

88
00:08:15,493 --> 00:08:19,372
- CTU, this is Myers.
- It's Jack. What exactly did Walsh say?

89
00:08:19,453 --> 00:08:23,651
- Just bring everyone in. No details.
- Why does this have to be tonight?

90
00:08:23,733 --> 00:08:27,203
- Problems at home?
- I'm almost there. I'll see you in a few.

91
00:08:32,533 --> 00:08:36,845
- How long is this gonna take?
- Why? Are we interrupting your social life?

92
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:39,731
- At least I have one.
- Funny.

93
00:08:41,133 --> 00:08:44,205
- Have you called Langley?
- Sure did. Called the bureau too.

94
00:08:44,293 --> 00:08:50,209
- Nobody knows anything. Jack on his way?
- Yeah, unfortunately for us, the mood he's in.

95
00:09:01,573 --> 00:09:04,849
- Hello.
- Hey. Did you hear from Kim yet?

96
00:09:05,293 --> 00:09:07,124
No.

97
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:11,126
I was thinking we should try to remember
what it was like when we were kids.

98
00:09:11,213 --> 00:09:14,285
- It's a different world now, Jack.
- Yeah, I know.

99
00:09:15,453 --> 00:09:17,569
- Evening, Jack.
- Hey, Paul.

100
00:09:17,653 --> 00:09:21,692
I was talking to Denise the other day and
she and Steve took Nicki to a therapist.

101
00:09:21,773 --> 00:09:24,207
They said it helped.
We should think about that.

102
00:09:24,293 --> 00:09:28,206
Yeah, well, maybe.
Can we talk about it when I get home?

103
00:09:29,213 --> 00:09:34,003
Honey, I'm already here. Let me
give you a call back in a little while.

104
00:09:34,973 --> 00:09:36,326
- Who's here?
- Everyone.

105
00:09:36,413 --> 00:09:39,644
We're waiting for Walsh.
I activated a satellite uplink in case.

106
00:09:39,733 --> 00:09:43,851
OK, good. Tony? I need detailed background
on everyone on David Palmer's staff now.

107
00:09:43,933 --> 00:09:44,729
Why?

108
00:09:44,813 --> 00:09:47,566
Cos I think this is about him
and I want us to be prepared.

109
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:51,487
Bad time to play a hunch.
If it leaks out that we're screening Palmer,

110
00:09:51,573 --> 00:09:55,009
- people might think it's cos he's black.
- It is because he's black.

111
00:09:55,093 --> 00:09:59,211
- It makes him the most likely target.
- It might not be interpreted that way.

112
00:09:59,293 --> 00:10:04,003
I don't care. I just gave you an order
and I'd like you to follow it, please.

113
00:10:04,093 --> 00:10:08,928
Good. Thank you. Let me know as soon as
Walsh gets here. I gotta make a phone call.

114
00:10:38,093 --> 00:10:40,687
- Hey.
- Hey, how are you?

115
00:10:47,533 --> 00:10:50,127
Come on. Let's go in.

116
00:10:54,493 --> 00:10:56,484
Hi.

117
00:10:58,133 --> 00:11:01,250
- You must be Rick.
- I must be.

118
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:04,882
- Janet said you guys like to party.
- As a matter of fact, yeah.

119
00:11:04,973 --> 00:11:07,851
As a matter of fact, me too.

120
00:11:07,933 --> 00:11:10,163
Glad to hear it.

121
00:11:11,453 --> 00:11:13,762
Let's get this party started.

122
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:17,567
Yeah.

123
00:11:17,653 --> 00:11:19,644
Follow me.

124
00:11:44,533 --> 00:11:47,445
- Come on!
- No. I'm not going up there.

125
00:11:49,693 --> 00:11:51,684
- Smoke?
- Yeah.

126
00:11:55,893 --> 00:11:59,010
Polls open in less than seven
hours here in California...

127
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:01,687
Detective Cox-Lovell, please.

128
00:12:02,453 --> 00:12:03,932
Yeah.

129
00:12:04,013 --> 00:12:08,370
Senator Palmer arrived this morning...

130
00:12:09,853 --> 00:12:13,846
Frank. Yeah, it's Jack Bauer over at CTU.
This is kind of embarrassing,

131
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:17,164
but my daughter Kimberly snuck out
and she's not come back yet.

132
00:12:17,253 --> 00:12:20,529
I wondered if we sent her vitals over,
if you could keep an eye out.

133
00:12:20,613 --> 00:12:22,763
- Is she OK?
- Yeah, I'm sure she's OK.

134
00:12:22,853 --> 00:12:25,811
No, that'd be great.
Frank, thanks a lot. I owe you. Bye.

135
00:12:25,893 --> 00:12:28,123
Richard. Everybody's inside. Come on.

136
00:12:28,213 --> 00:12:29,441
- Mr. Walsh.
- Hello, Nina.

137
00:12:29,533 --> 00:12:31,524
- Shall we get started?
- Please.

138
00:12:34,773 --> 00:12:40,530
We believe that by the end of the day an
attempt will be made on David Palmer's life.

139
00:12:40,973 --> 00:12:42,691
- How good's his security?
- Very good.

140
00:12:42,773 --> 00:12:45,606
Maybe not be good enough
to handle what's coming today.

141
00:12:45,693 --> 00:12:49,402
- A shooter, well-funded, from overseas.
- What foreign power wants Palmer dead?

142
00:12:49,493 --> 00:12:53,850
Probably none. Most likely a domestic hate
group hired someone from out of the country.

143
00:12:53,933 --> 00:12:57,642
It's harder to trace. Check the background
of everyone around Palmer.

144
00:12:57,733 --> 00:13:02,090
- Cross it with terrorist databases. Start now.
- OK, we're on it. Let's go.

145
00:13:02,173 --> 00:13:03,765
Jack.

146
00:13:07,013 --> 00:13:09,083
I'll be right with you.

147
00:13:10,293 --> 00:13:12,284
How you doing?

148
00:13:13,093 --> 00:13:16,005
- I can't complain.
- Can't or won't?

149
00:13:18,053 --> 00:13:20,647
Things better at home?

150
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:23,372
Yeah. Yeah, we're trying.

151
00:13:25,173 --> 00:13:28,290
What I'm about to tell you
doesn't leave this room.

152
00:13:29,053 --> 00:13:31,044
Fine.

153
00:13:37,053 --> 00:13:40,887
There may be an element inside the agency
involved with the hit on Palmer.

154
00:13:40,973 --> 00:13:43,646
- What?
- The next 24 hours, I want you all over this.

155
00:13:43,733 --> 00:13:45,724
You'll interface with every division.

156
00:13:45,813 --> 00:13:49,328
I am the last person that you want
to bring something like this to.

157
00:13:49,413 --> 00:13:51,449
- I don't agree.
- Richard...

158
00:13:52,493 --> 00:13:56,566
I built a case against three of our own
agents and busted them for taking bribes.

159
00:13:56,653 --> 00:14:00,407
If there's a conspiracy in the agency,
I'll never get anywhere near it.

160
00:14:00,493 --> 00:14:03,087
Well, you'll have to, Jack.

161
00:14:04,173 --> 00:14:06,971
Because you're the only guy that I can trust.

162
00:14:15,973 --> 00:14:21,286
If Palmer gets hit, the first African-American
with a real shot at the White House,

163
00:14:21,373 --> 00:14:24,206
it'll tear this country apart.

164
00:14:33,693 --> 00:14:37,049
- I'll look into it. I'll do the best I can.
- Good. Good.

165
00:14:38,013 --> 00:14:41,642
George Mason is coming to give you
a more detailed briefing on Palmer.

166
00:14:41,733 --> 00:14:43,724
You think I should trust George Mason?

167
00:14:43,813 --> 00:14:47,522
Until we get a better handle on things,
don't trust anybody.

168
00:14:50,453 --> 00:14:53,251
Not even your own people.

169
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:58,491
We gotta find the shooter, Jack.
Whatever it takes.

170
00:15:03,453 --> 00:15:07,366
Excuse me? How much longer
till we land in Los Angeles?

171
00:15:07,453 --> 00:15:10,525
Well, let's see. It's 12.20. Just over an hour.

172
00:15:10,613 --> 00:15:12,604
Thank you.

173
00:15:30,133 --> 00:15:32,010
Brooks here.

174
00:15:32,093 --> 00:15:35,324
Hey, Martin, how you doing?
It's the photographer.

175
00:15:35,413 --> 00:15:39,929
I'm very well, Patty. I'm landing in one hour.
Are we still on for breakfast?

176
00:15:40,013 --> 00:15:43,323
Meet Secret Service in the lobby at seven.
They'll take care of you.

177
00:15:43,413 --> 00:15:46,644
- Will Senator Palmer be at the breakfast?
- You bet.

178
00:15:47,133 --> 00:15:49,772
Good. I'll see you then.

179
00:15:49,853 --> 00:15:51,764
Drive safe.

180
00:15:51,853 --> 00:15:56,051
Um, excuse me. So, you know David Palmer?

181
00:15:57,093 --> 00:16:01,052
Not yet. I am, uh, meeting him tomorrow.

182
00:16:01,133 --> 00:16:04,808
We have been sitting here
this whole time making small talk

183
00:16:04,893 --> 00:16:07,487
and you never even mentioned it.

184
00:16:08,093 --> 00:16:11,449
I am going to be taking a few pictures of him.

185
00:16:11,533 --> 00:16:14,411
Are you...? You're a photographer.

186
00:16:14,493 --> 00:16:15,767
Have I...

187
00:16:15,853 --> 00:16:18,651
Have I ever seen one of your photographs?

188
00:16:21,093 --> 00:16:22,242
What's next?

189
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:26,804
George Mason's gonna be here in a couple
of minutes and then he's gonna brief me.

190
00:16:26,893 --> 00:16:28,884
You, not us?

191
00:16:32,053 --> 00:16:35,489
- You can't shut me out, Jack. Not here.
- It's Walsh.

192
00:16:35,573 --> 00:16:37,643
- He wants me to meet Mason alone.
- Why?

193
00:16:37,733 --> 00:16:39,644
He didn't say.

194
00:16:39,733 --> 00:16:41,883
You're lying.

195
00:16:41,973 --> 00:16:45,170
Yes, I am. But you're still
gonna have to trust me.

196
00:16:46,373 --> 00:16:48,728
One of these days
you're gonna ask for too much.

197
00:16:50,573 --> 00:16:53,724
I'm terribly afraid that
today's gonna be that day. Yep.

198
00:16:53,813 --> 00:16:56,930
- Hi, it's me.
- Did you hear anything?

199
00:16:57,013 --> 00:16:59,811
- No.
- What's wrong?

200
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:02,885
- I found three joints in her desk.
- Terrific.

201
00:17:02,973 --> 00:17:06,010
I know it's not the end of the world,
but I don't like it.

202
00:17:06,093 --> 00:17:11,326
I don't either. Maybe you can get into her
email, check her messages or something.

203
00:17:11,413 --> 00:17:15,565
We gave her her own password
to show that we trusted her, remember?

204
00:17:15,653 --> 00:17:17,211
Yeah.

205
00:17:17,293 --> 00:17:22,242
Honey, I'm so sorry that I can't
be there with you right now.

206
00:17:22,733 --> 00:17:26,169
Look, I can't really talk right now.
Let me call you back, OK?

207
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:28,244
- OK.
- OK, bye.

208
00:17:31,293 --> 00:17:33,284
- Everything OK?
- Yep.

209
00:17:38,093 --> 00:17:42,883
So when I got into San Diego State,
I figured, what the hell, give college a try.

210
00:17:44,133 --> 00:17:46,931
- Do you live near the beach?
- Yeah.

211
00:17:48,293 --> 00:17:51,444
- Do you surf?
- No. Surfing's way too motivated.

212
00:17:51,533 --> 00:17:55,606
You gotta get wet, there's sharks,
you gotta call everybody "dude".

213
00:17:57,613 --> 00:18:00,002
- Why?
- Oh, no reason.

214
00:18:00,693 --> 00:18:02,968
My dad surfs. Surfed.

215
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:06,331
He doesn't any more? He's too old?

216
00:18:06,413 --> 00:18:08,643
My father's dead.

217
00:18:09,573 --> 00:18:11,211
Hey. My bad.

218
00:18:13,053 --> 00:18:16,682
It's OK. He was this... really great guy,

219
00:18:16,773 --> 00:18:19,492
and then, uh, six months ago...

220
00:18:19,573 --> 00:18:21,564
I'm sorry.

221
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:25,043
I'm over it.

222
00:18:25,133 --> 00:18:27,931
Getting over it. It's hard, but I am.

223
00:18:36,693 --> 00:18:39,491
Mason's on his way up.

224
00:18:52,373 --> 00:18:54,682
- George.
- Jack. How's it going?

225
00:18:54,773 --> 00:18:59,324
- Good to see you. Come on in.
- How much did Walsh tell you down there?

226
00:18:59,773 --> 00:19:05,609
Not much. That Palmer's the target,
the shooter's the real deal. That's about it.

227
00:19:05,693 --> 00:19:08,890
- I can narrow it down for you if you like.
- Please do.

228
00:19:10,693 --> 00:19:13,571
We think the shooter's European,
probably German,

229
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:17,168
and that he's either here already
or he's coming today.

230
00:19:17,253 --> 00:19:21,371
This'll get you into secured data nationwide.
See if it clicks with anything you have.

231
00:19:21,453 --> 00:19:24,923
- Who's the source on this?
- That I can't give you.

232
00:19:25,653 --> 00:19:28,486
- Because?
- Because I'm not authorised to.

233
00:19:29,573 --> 00:19:34,806
How can I crosscheck the data if I don't know
where the original information's come from?

234
00:19:36,053 --> 00:19:39,170
What do you know about Palmer's politics?

235
00:19:40,813 --> 00:19:46,171
You know he's no friend of the agency, right?
If he gets elected, this place gets gutted.

236
00:19:46,253 --> 00:19:48,972
- What are you trying to say?
- I'm not saying anything.

237
00:19:49,053 --> 00:19:53,205
I'm saying do your job
and stay out of what doesn't concern you.

238
00:19:53,293 --> 00:19:54,567
Fair enough.

239
00:19:54,653 --> 00:19:56,883
Good. Then we're done.

240
00:19:59,093 --> 00:20:05,612
George, I need a favour. I need you to call
your boss and ask him to give me clearance

241
00:20:05,693 --> 00:20:09,003
- on the identification of the source.
- We agreed it didn't matter.

242
00:20:09,093 --> 00:20:12,165
I've still gotta call Walsh
and tell him I did everything I could.

243
00:20:12,253 --> 00:20:14,608
I would like to cover my own ass.

244
00:20:14,693 --> 00:20:17,890
Jack, you're finally learning
how to play the game.

245
00:20:17,973 --> 00:20:20,487
Sure, I'll call Chapelle for you.
Use your phone?

246
00:20:20,573 --> 00:20:23,212
Please do. You want a cup of coffee?

247
00:20:23,613 --> 00:20:26,366
No, I'm good. Thanks.

248
00:20:34,133 --> 00:20:36,931
I wanna hear Mason's call.

249
00:20:42,733 --> 00:20:48,046
At the sound of the tone,
the time will be 12.29 and 30 seconds.

250
00:20:55,773 --> 00:20:57,809
At the sound of the tone, the time will be...

251
00:20:57,893 --> 00:21:02,523
Yeah, yeah. I'm talking to my boss, Jack.
Right, you stupid chump.

252
00:21:07,693 --> 00:21:11,652
- What are you doing?
- He's screwing with us. Get me that binder.

253
00:21:11,733 --> 00:21:13,485
- What?
- The binder. Get it.

254
00:21:13,573 --> 00:21:16,724
At the sound of the tone...

255
00:21:18,173 --> 00:21:20,528
Do we need to talk about this?

256
00:21:30,973 --> 00:21:32,486
Nina...

257
00:21:45,213 --> 00:21:50,048
Well, you can consider your ass
officially covered. Chapelle said no.

258
00:22:01,533 --> 00:22:06,323
- You are out of your mind.
- Mason's holding something back.

259
00:22:06,413 --> 00:22:09,803
- I need some bargaining power.
- How are you gonna get it?

260
00:22:09,893 --> 00:22:11,770
Remember Phillipe Darcet?

261
00:22:11,853 --> 00:22:13,844
Heroin dealer, Barcelona?

262
00:22:13,933 --> 00:22:17,972
Yeah. Mason was a point man
on his bust last August.

263
00:22:18,053 --> 00:22:21,489
When they rolled up Darcet's assets,
$200,000 was missing.

264
00:22:21,573 --> 00:22:25,851
I always thought it fell into
Mason's pockets. Now I need proof.

265
00:22:27,173 --> 00:22:30,085
You're gonna blackmail a district director?

266
00:22:30,613 --> 00:22:33,047
I want you to check Darcet's accounts.

267
00:22:33,133 --> 00:22:36,648
You can access them through
the secured files. Use this.

268
00:22:37,413 --> 00:22:40,325
Nina, he's gonna wake up
in half an hour or less.

269
00:23:08,933 --> 00:23:12,721
Palmer blending intelligence,
political courage, hard work and luck.

270
00:23:16,213 --> 00:23:17,931
Dammit! Hello.

271
00:23:18,013 --> 00:23:20,891
I'm sorry to bother you at this hour.
My name is Alan York.

272
00:23:20,973 --> 00:23:24,170
I found this number
in my daughter's calendar.

273
00:23:24,533 --> 00:23:28,492
- Who's your daughter?
- Janet. Janet York. Do you have a son or...?

274
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:32,851
Daughter. Kimberly. She snuck out
of the house. Is Janet gone too?

275
00:23:32,933 --> 00:23:36,369
Yes. I bet they're together.
Any idea where they might be?

276
00:23:36,453 --> 00:23:38,683
None. Did Janet say anything?

277
00:23:38,773 --> 00:23:43,688
She was gone when I came home from work.
Can I give you my number in case you hear?

278
00:23:43,773 --> 00:23:45,172
Oh, yeah, of course.

279
00:23:48,893 --> 00:23:51,566
- I've got Darcet's account number.
- Good.

280
00:23:51,653 --> 00:23:54,770
It's encrypted. I can't get around it.

281
00:23:54,853 --> 00:23:57,492
- Ask Tony to do it.
- He'll need a reason.

282
00:23:58,773 --> 00:24:02,482
If he thinks he's doing it for me,
not if he's doing it for you.

283
00:24:04,173 --> 00:24:06,368
I'm surprised you noticed.

284
00:24:06,893 --> 00:24:09,487
I noticed.

285
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:12,485
Well, you shouldn't have.

286
00:24:25,573 --> 00:24:29,202
- Tony, I need you to do something for me.
- For you or for Jack?

287
00:24:31,173 --> 00:24:34,404
I need you to get into this account.

288
00:24:34,933 --> 00:24:38,050
What does Phillipe Darcet's
bank account have to do with Palmer?

289
00:24:38,133 --> 00:24:41,603
We don't know yet.
We're trying to pick up a thread.

290
00:24:41,693 --> 00:24:45,208
That's interesting, cos I've been
trying to pick up a thread of my own.

291
00:24:45,293 --> 00:24:47,488
About what?

292
00:24:47,573 --> 00:24:50,167
Whether you're still sleeping with Jack.

293
00:24:51,213 --> 00:24:53,408
Who says I ever did?

294
00:24:54,333 --> 00:24:57,882
What do you see in him? He turned in
his own people, for Christ's sake.

295
00:24:57,973 --> 00:25:01,170
- They were dirty.
- Oh, and he's Mr. Clean, huh?

296
00:25:02,253 --> 00:25:07,452
Yes, he is. Look, we don't have
a lot of time. Will you help me out here?

297
00:25:08,413 --> 00:25:10,404
Please.

298
00:25:11,493 --> 00:25:13,643
I'll see what I can find.

299
00:25:15,293 --> 00:25:17,887
I'll see what I can find.

300
00:25:28,493 --> 00:25:31,166
Jamey. If I give you a phone number,

301
00:25:31,253 --> 00:25:34,165
could you get all the Internet
passwords connected to it?

302
00:25:34,253 --> 00:25:38,041
- Sure, if you have a warrant.
- And if I didn't have a warrant?

303
00:25:39,053 --> 00:25:41,851
- It's important?
- It's pretty important.

304
00:25:46,853 --> 00:25:48,809
Go.

305
00:26:09,133 --> 00:26:13,046
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me. I got her password.

306
00:26:13,133 --> 00:26:14,964
What is it?

307
00:26:15,053 --> 00:26:18,728
- "Lifesucks". One word.
- Perfect.

308
00:26:18,813 --> 00:26:22,169
So, um, are you gonna be
around this weekend?

309
00:26:22,253 --> 00:26:24,164
I could be.

310
00:26:25,133 --> 00:26:27,124
Be.

311
00:26:36,093 --> 00:26:38,687
- Where are they?
- I don't know.

312
00:26:47,413 --> 00:26:50,564
- Did you ever meet Princess Di?
- Yeah.

313
00:26:50,653 --> 00:26:53,247
But I never took her picture.

314
00:26:54,093 --> 00:26:56,004
What was she like?

315
00:26:56,093 --> 00:26:58,084
She was cool.

316
00:27:01,613 --> 00:27:03,604
Can I, uh...

317
00:27:05,733 --> 00:27:08,566
Can I see one of your photographs?

318
00:27:09,973 --> 00:27:11,964
- My photographs?
- Yeah.

319
00:27:13,013 --> 00:27:15,004
Yeah.

320
00:27:18,693 --> 00:27:21,491
How about this one right here?

321
00:27:28,853 --> 00:27:30,844
It's very beautiful.

322
00:27:30,933 --> 00:27:32,924
Hmm.

323
00:27:33,453 --> 00:27:35,444
- Munich?
- Yep.

324
00:27:44,053 --> 00:27:46,009
Finish the speech?

325
00:27:46,093 --> 00:27:49,722
Taking a break. The guys
got tired of me yelling at them.

326
00:27:49,813 --> 00:27:52,088
Big ol' grumpy bear.

327
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:04,046
- How you doing?
- Fine. Just a few dozen more to go.

328
00:28:04,133 --> 00:28:08,445
- You don't have to do these yourself.
- Personal little touch never hurts.

329
00:28:08,533 --> 00:28:11,525
- Sure doesn't.
- Ooh, yes. Yes, yes, yes. Mm.

330
00:28:12,653 --> 00:28:14,564
Sir?

331
00:28:14,933 --> 00:28:19,051
Phone call, Senator.
It's Maureen Kingsley from the network.

332
00:28:19,133 --> 00:28:23,490
- Come on, Patty, it's after midnight.
- She says it's urgent.

333
00:28:28,813 --> 00:28:31,566
Maureen, this better be good.

334
00:28:31,653 --> 00:28:34,770
- Can I get you some coffee or anything?
- Thank you, Patty.

335
00:28:34,853 --> 00:28:38,402
My response? Here's my response.

336
00:28:38,933 --> 00:28:42,448
You air that allegation
or anything remotely like it...

337
00:28:47,293 --> 00:28:50,205
This conversation is over, Maureen.

338
00:28:57,893 --> 00:29:00,453
That'll be all, Patty.

339
00:29:01,773 --> 00:29:04,492
Sweetheart, what was it?

340
00:29:05,253 --> 00:29:08,006
Just more media nonsense. Not important.

341
00:29:10,413 --> 00:29:12,643
It didn't sound not important.

342
00:29:15,013 --> 00:29:17,846
Since when don't we talk about things?

343
00:29:52,893 --> 00:29:55,453
This is Richard Walsh.
At the tone leave a message.

344
00:29:55,533 --> 00:29:58,650
Richard, it's Jack.
Call me back. It's important.

345
00:30:06,373 --> 00:30:08,762
I thought you wanted
to get your life together.

346
00:30:08,853 --> 00:30:12,732
Make things right with your family.
You think this is helping?

347
00:30:13,613 --> 00:30:17,049
- He's got information that I need.
- What information?

348
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:21,645
Never mind. You can't tell me, fine.

349
00:30:21,733 --> 00:30:25,169
But, Jack, if Tony doesn't find anything,
you could end up in jail.

350
00:30:25,253 --> 00:30:28,643
- Probably.
- Then what are you doing?

351
00:30:33,933 --> 00:30:36,322
Jack,

352
00:30:36,413 --> 00:30:38,404
answer me.

353
00:30:39,693 --> 00:30:44,721
Nina, you can look the other way once
and it's no big deal,

354
00:30:44,813 --> 00:30:47,247
except it makes it easier
to compromise next time

355
00:30:47,333 --> 00:30:52,771
and soon all you're doing is compromising
because that's how you think things are done.

356
00:30:55,373 --> 00:30:58,763
You know those guys I blew the whistle on?
You think they were bad guys?

357
00:30:58,853 --> 00:31:02,528
Cos they weren't. They weren't bad guys.
They were just like you and me,

358
00:31:02,613 --> 00:31:05,525
except they compromised once.

359
00:31:16,453 --> 00:31:19,251
I'll see how Tony's coming along.

360
00:31:19,973 --> 00:31:21,964
Thank you.

361
00:31:36,093 --> 00:31:38,448
- Hello?
- Hi, it's Teri Bauer.

362
00:31:38,533 --> 00:31:41,923
- Hi. Have you heard anything?
- Yeah. I broke into Kim's email.

363
00:31:42,013 --> 00:31:45,085
Janet sent her one.
They're meeting two guys in the valley.

364
00:31:45,173 --> 00:31:48,483
- Did you get an address?
- Yep. I'm going right now.

365
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:52,646
Would you mind if I came along?
I'm getting stir crazy just sitting around here.

366
00:31:52,733 --> 00:31:56,009
- All right.
- I'm leaving now. Tell me where you live.

367
00:32:01,213 --> 00:32:04,842
- Where are we going now?
- Wasn't there a party at Lacy's?

368
00:32:04,933 --> 00:32:07,686
- Anybody got a phone? I'll call.
- Yeah, I do.

369
00:32:12,733 --> 00:32:15,725
- Um, I gotta go home.
- Why?

370
00:32:16,493 --> 00:32:19,451
- My mother left five messages.
- Run home to Mommy.

371
00:32:19,533 --> 00:32:23,287
Hey, her father just died, OK?
Maybe her mother needs her.

372
00:32:23,653 --> 00:32:25,803
Your father?

373
00:32:25,893 --> 00:32:28,407
- Shut up.
- Whatever.

374
00:32:29,373 --> 00:32:32,046
- I don't wanna go home.
- But...

375
00:32:33,733 --> 00:32:36,645
We'll drop you off, OK?

376
00:32:45,173 --> 00:32:47,164
Uh, yeah.

377
00:33:07,893 --> 00:33:10,885
- So, what's your name?
- Martin.

378
00:33:12,133 --> 00:33:14,601
I'm Mandy.

379
00:33:14,693 --> 00:33:18,845
Hey, maybe we can get together
when we're in LA or something.

380
00:33:20,973 --> 00:33:23,567
I'm gonna be pretty busy.

381
00:33:26,093 --> 00:33:28,448
See ya.

382
00:33:30,973 --> 00:33:33,533
- Yeah.
- I got into the Darcet account.

383
00:33:33,613 --> 00:33:36,650
- Nina said you wanted it.
- Thank you. Send it to my screen.

384
00:33:36,733 --> 00:33:38,724
All right.

385
00:33:52,653 --> 00:33:54,564
Wake up.

386
00:33:59,813 --> 00:34:01,531
Sit down.

387
00:34:02,133 --> 00:34:05,330
Who's the source?
Who tipped us on the Palmer hit?

388
00:34:09,613 --> 00:34:13,891
Last August, when you led
the takedown of Phillipe Darcet,

389
00:34:13,973 --> 00:34:18,012
all his assets were transferred to
a custodial account in Langley, Virginia.

390
00:34:18,093 --> 00:34:20,846
$200,000 fell out along the way.

391
00:34:20,933 --> 00:34:24,369
I traced that money
to an offshore account in Aruba.

392
00:34:25,213 --> 00:34:29,411
I got a funny feeling about that account,
George. I think it's yours.

393
00:34:29,493 --> 00:34:32,485
Yeah. Well, that's a lie.

394
00:34:32,573 --> 00:34:34,609
Good.

395
00:34:34,693 --> 00:34:38,129
Then you won't mind
if I send Chapelle the information.

396
00:34:43,573 --> 00:34:45,564
The source, George.

397
00:34:49,173 --> 00:34:51,812
You have no idea
what you're getting yourself into.

398
00:34:51,893 --> 00:34:57,411
Why don't you explain it to me?
You've got five seconds.

399
00:35:01,013 --> 00:35:02,526
Wait.

400
00:35:08,733 --> 00:35:10,724
There's your source.

401
00:35:18,053 --> 00:35:21,409
- Thanks for your help, George.
- You'll live to regret this, Bauer.

402
00:35:21,493 --> 00:35:24,087
I promise you that.

403
00:35:37,813 --> 00:35:41,522
- Um, excuse me.
- Ma'am, we're about to land. If you could...

404
00:36:10,133 --> 00:36:12,567
Sh!

405
00:36:46,213 --> 00:36:49,125
- Sir, would you remain in your seat?
- I lost my wallet.

406
00:37:45,613 --> 00:37:47,808
- Hello?
- Hey. It's me.

407
00:37:47,893 --> 00:37:49,929
- Turn left at the light.
- What?

408
00:37:50,013 --> 00:37:54,370
I'm in a car with Alan York. He's the father
of one of Kimberly's friends, Janet.

409
00:37:54,453 --> 00:37:57,650
- What are you talking about?
- Kim got an email from Janet.

410
00:37:57,733 --> 00:38:00,531
- We think they might be out together.
- Where?

411
00:38:00,613 --> 00:38:04,162
Don't know yet. They're meeting
some guys in the valley.

412
00:38:04,253 --> 00:38:07,848
Wait a second. You're going to
the valley with this guy Alan York?

413
00:38:07,933 --> 00:38:10,049
What are you gonna do if she's not there?

414
00:38:10,133 --> 00:38:13,364
We haven't thought
that far ahead yet. I'll call...

415
00:38:15,493 --> 00:38:17,211
Hello?

416
00:38:17,293 --> 00:38:19,284
Teri?

417
00:38:30,053 --> 00:38:31,611
- Hey.
- Hey.

418
00:38:31,693 --> 00:38:34,161
Could you do me a favour?
Could you cover for me?

419
00:38:34,253 --> 00:38:35,242
Sure.

420
00:38:35,333 --> 00:38:39,565
OK, forward all my calls to my cellphone.
I'll be back as soon as I can.

421
00:38:40,573 --> 00:38:42,564
- Jack.
- What?

422
00:38:44,533 --> 00:38:47,206
A 747 just blew up over the Mojave desert.

423
00:38:47,293 --> 00:38:50,763
Preliminary reports make
it sound like it was a bomb.

424
00:38:53,093 --> 00:38:55,926
Passenger list.
Get me Walsh on the phone now.

425
00:39:10,333 --> 00:39:12,324
Janet?

426
00:39:21,093 --> 00:39:23,209
Oh, turn here. I live on Tenth.

427
00:39:25,693 --> 00:39:29,368
- Dan, I just told you that I...
- Why don't you just relax?

428
00:39:32,133 --> 00:39:36,251
- Can you please tell him he missed the turn?
- You heard him. Relax.

429
00:39:37,173 --> 00:39:39,733
Night's just getting started.
