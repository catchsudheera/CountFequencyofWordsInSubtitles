1
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,442
Mr President, with respect to the death
of Alan Milliken, I know you lied.

2
00:00:18,566 --> 00:00:21,720
You told the police Sherry was with you
at the time of Milliken's death.

3
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:25,050
Her fingerprints on this prescription bottle
prove otherwise.

4
00:00:25,174 --> 00:00:27,737
- What do you want?
- Your resignation.

5
00:00:27,817 --> 00:00:29,855
Without this, Sherry's got nothing.

6
00:00:29,979 --> 00:00:32,450
I can call Foxton
and he can make this disappear.

7
00:00:32,583 --> 00:00:34,223
You mean steal evidence?

8
00:00:34,345 --> 00:00:37,146
I just heard Tony took Jane Saunders.

9
00:00:37,268 --> 00:00:40,628
Saunders has Michelle.
He wants to trade her for his daughter.

10
00:00:40,713 --> 00:00:43,469
Tony, put the gun on the dash!

11
00:00:43,596 --> 00:00:46,831
You help me make this trade,
I'll turn myself in, go to prison, whatever.

12
00:00:48,282 --> 00:00:51,756
We don't have a visual on Saunders.

13
00:00:51,886 --> 00:00:54,039
Keep your teams down. Stay down.

14
00:00:55,451 --> 00:00:57,648
I can't.

15
00:00:57,773 --> 00:01:00,336
Jane! It's OK! Come here!

16
00:01:00,417 --> 00:01:02,410
Teams A and B move. Move now!

17
00:01:07,065 --> 00:01:08,944
Stephen!

18
00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:15,355
I'm pinned down! Saunders has a helicopter.
Call in air support now!

19
00:01:22,804 --> 00:01:25,560
11 vials of the virus are unaccounted for.
Where are they?

20
00:01:25,687 --> 00:01:27,840
It's not gonna be that simple, Jack.

21
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:31,763
This is Jack Bauer. Saunders is in custody.

22
00:02:02,452 --> 00:02:07,852
We just got verification. There's 11 vials.
How long till you can give us their location?

23
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:11,373
I'm not sure I can.
Saunders applied a decryption overlay.

24
00:02:11,503 --> 00:02:15,342
Unauthorized access will erase
the file structure. I'll keep trying.

25
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:19,827
- Where are the 11 vials?
- You're wasting your time.

26
00:02:19,954 --> 00:02:22,026
I don't have that information in there.

27
00:02:22,637 --> 00:02:24,311
Where are the vials?

28
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:29,158
- In the hands of true believers.
- Believers in what?

29
00:02:29,285 --> 00:02:32,565
That the greatest threat to world peace
comes from this country.

30
00:02:32,689 --> 00:02:37,610
There's a hotel near here where 800 innocent
people are dead or dying because of you.

31
00:02:37,735 --> 00:02:39,568
Were they a threat to world peace?

32
00:02:39,698 --> 00:02:45,541
The US must retreat within its own borders.
Those people are the first casualties of war.

33
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:51,345
What happened to you, Stephen?

34
00:02:53,474 --> 00:02:55,786
I was abandoned by the people I worked for,

35
00:02:57,559 --> 00:03:00,202
as you'll be some day.

36
00:03:00,323 --> 00:03:05,005
- But my message will be heard in one hour.
- What are you talking about?

37
00:03:05,129 --> 00:03:09,685
My couriers have been instructed to release
the virus at noon. They can't be recalled.

38
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:12,935
Tell us where they are. We'll stop them.

39
00:03:13,619 --> 00:03:17,378
That is possible.
But only if you agree to my terms.

40
00:03:17,504 --> 00:03:21,627
- What are your terms?
- I have a private jet at Van Nuys airport.

41
00:03:21,709 --> 00:03:27,073
I need to be on it, with a presidential
guarantee of safe passage to North Africa.

42
00:03:27,196 --> 00:03:31,558
- Never gonna happen.
- Then hundreds of thousands will die.

43
00:03:35,005 --> 00:03:39,448
I know what you're thinking, but the Bosnian
police had two years and couldn't break me.

44
00:03:39,571 --> 00:03:43,728
Do you really think you'll be able to do it
in less than an hour?

45
00:03:44,377 --> 00:03:47,611
Get me on that plane, Jack.
You don't have a choice.

46
00:03:56,672 --> 00:03:59,235
Bring me Jane Saunders.

47
00:04:00,596 --> 00:04:03,159
I'm gonna need your gun, Tony.

48
00:04:07,885 --> 00:04:10,926
- Frisk him.
- Up against the wall.

49
00:04:11,049 --> 00:04:14,602
- Hey! You don't have to do that.
- I've got my orders.

50
00:04:14,734 --> 00:04:16,852
- He's one of us.
- Not any more.

51
00:04:16,976 --> 00:04:19,288
- What's going on?
- I'm taking him into custody.

52
00:04:19,419 --> 00:04:22,495
That's straight from
Brad Hammond at Division.

53
00:04:23,224 --> 00:04:26,105
I'm sorry, Tony.
There's nothing we can do right now.

54
00:04:26,228 --> 00:04:30,306
Just take care of business, Jack.
I'll be all right.

55
00:04:35,158 --> 00:04:40,113
- They said you wanted to see me.
- I need you to speak with your father.

56
00:04:40,645 --> 00:04:44,643
- What do you want me to say?
- Try to make it personal, connect with him.

57
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:49,372
Tell him you're scared,
that you don't want him to do this.

58
00:04:49,496 --> 00:04:51,489
I'll try.

59
00:05:05,235 --> 00:05:10,076
I know what's going to happen...
and I know you can stop it.

60
00:05:10,201 --> 00:05:12,354
Please.

61
00:05:12,484 --> 00:05:15,685
I won't let them use you to manipulate me.

62
00:05:16,929 --> 00:05:20,164
Despite everything that's happened...

63
00:05:22,016 --> 00:05:27,574
I love you, and I'm asking you,
please don't let this happen.

64
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:29,741
This doesn't make any sense.

65
00:05:29,865 --> 00:05:35,424
It doesn't make sense to you
because you haven't seen what I've seen.

66
00:05:35,552 --> 00:05:37,510
You don't understand.

67
00:05:38,596 --> 00:05:42,354
You think what happened to you
is the government's fault, and maybe it is.

68
00:05:42,481 --> 00:05:47,037
- But the people who'll die are innocent.
- And that is tragic, Jane.

69
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:52,007
But it has to happen for things to change,
and they must change.

70
00:05:52,132 --> 00:05:54,569
How can you do something like this?

71
00:05:55,617 --> 00:05:58,259
- I'm doing it for your sake.
- For my sake?

72
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,293
For you and your children.

73
00:06:00,382 --> 00:06:03,696
After it's all over,
the world will be a better place.

74
00:06:03,827 --> 00:06:05,706
Please, Dad.

75
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:09,791
Please.

76
00:06:12,117 --> 00:06:14,953
Please. Don't do this.

77
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:18,360
Jane, I don't expect you to understand now.

78
00:06:18,484 --> 00:06:21,048
But one day you will.

79
00:06:21,168 --> 00:06:25,530
And you'll look back
and you'll thank me for what I've done.

80
00:06:27,816 --> 00:06:28,852
Yeah.

81
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:33,212
- Oh, my God.
- Jane.

82
00:06:33,343 --> 00:06:35,301
Jane!

83
00:06:36,667 --> 00:06:38,546
Jane.

84
00:06:42,354 --> 00:06:44,745
We're on the move.
Get the choppers ready.

85
00:06:53,407 --> 00:06:55,844
- Hello?
- Sherry, it's David.

86
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:58,772
<i>- Hello, David.
- I've been thinking things over.</i>

87
00:06:58,894 --> 00:07:03,290
What Keeler offered you.
How did you put it? A seat at the table?

88
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:08,541
- Yeah, something like that.
- Well, there may be a seat at my table.

89
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:11,137
It's a little too late for that, David.

90
00:07:11,709 --> 00:07:17,234
Sherry, I think it's in both our best interests
for you to hear what I have to offer.

91
00:07:17,356 --> 00:07:19,475
All right. I'm listening.

92
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:23,438
- No, not on the phone. In person.
- Where, then?

93
00:07:23,524 --> 00:07:26,884
- At Latham Park, the old baseball ground.
- I know it.

94
00:07:27,008 --> 00:07:30,209
- I'll meet you there in 25 minutes.
- That's short notice.

95
00:07:30,332 --> 00:07:32,290
But you will be there.

96
00:07:32,415 --> 00:07:36,971
- You're in no position to make demands.
- Sherry, I have a schedule to keep.

97
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:42,021
If I start changing things, it will attract
attention, and neither one of us wants that.

98
00:07:42,146 --> 00:07:45,301
All right, David.
I'll hear what you have to say.

99
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:47,264
Fine.

100
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:56,400
Yeah.

101
00:07:56,524 --> 00:08:00,283
- She should be leaving soon to meet me.
- I knew she'd go for it.

102
00:08:00,409 --> 00:08:02,606
She's enjoying having me over a barrel.

103
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:06,086
- I could hear it in her voice.
- Don't worry about that, David.

104
00:08:06,216 --> 00:08:09,610
If we can find this prescription bottle,
all her leverage is gone.

105
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:11,255
How long will you need?

106
00:08:11,382 --> 00:08:14,344
The more time we have,
the better our chance of finding it.

107
00:08:14,466 --> 00:08:18,099
I'll do whatever I can
to keep her there with me.

108
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:20,794
Wayne... find it.

109
00:08:48,467 --> 00:08:54,071
Take a look at your handiwork.
You murdered these people. Whole families!

110
00:08:54,194 --> 00:08:58,033
Sometimes a fire needs to be lit
in order to put out another fire.

111
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:00,756
I don't wanna hear your justification.
This is over!

112
00:09:00,882 --> 00:09:03,719
You are gonna tell me
how to find the rest of the vials now!

113
00:09:03,846 --> 00:09:08,607
Or you'll send me inside the hotel?
I'm prepared to die for my cause, Jack.

114
00:09:11,015 --> 00:09:13,486
Yeah, I know.

115
00:09:13,618 --> 00:09:16,773
<i>- Chase. Come in.
- Copy that.</i>

116
00:09:40,771 --> 00:09:43,129
What are you doing, Jack?

117
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:51,417
- Why did you bring me here?
- Ask your father. It's up to him.

118
00:09:51,544 --> 00:09:53,503
Dad?

119
00:09:54,308 --> 00:09:57,543
Tell me how to find your couriers,
or I'll put her in that building.

120
00:09:57,672 --> 00:10:01,670
- She has nothing to do with this!
- Neither do the people in those body bags.

121
00:10:01,757 --> 00:10:05,356
I am gonna do everything I have to
to stop you releasing more of this virus.

122
00:10:05,481 --> 00:10:08,875
- How could you do this?
- I'm gonna give you one chance.

123
00:10:09,005 --> 00:10:11,397
No, you're not.

124
00:10:11,529 --> 00:10:15,607
- Tell me how I find them.
- You know you can't do this, Jack.

125
00:10:15,734 --> 00:10:18,729
You are a government agent.

126
00:10:18,858 --> 00:10:22,138
Send her in. Take her inside now!

127
00:10:22,862 --> 00:10:26,940
No. Dad, stop them! Dad, stop them!

128
00:10:27,068 --> 00:10:30,621
Stop it! Dad! Dad, please!

129
00:10:30,752 --> 00:10:32,346
No! No!

130
00:10:34,076 --> 00:10:35,875
Jane...

131
00:10:35,998 --> 00:10:40,759
Everything that happens to your daughter
is because of you.

132
00:10:42,206 --> 00:10:44,439
Get her out of there, Jack.

133
00:10:44,569 --> 00:10:47,132
- Dad, please!
- Jack, get her out of there!

134
00:10:47,252 --> 00:10:49,371
- Where are the vials?
- Get her out of there!

135
00:10:49,495 --> 00:10:51,533
How do I find the vials?

136
00:10:51,657 --> 00:10:55,177
Let her go! Do as I say now, Jack!

137
00:10:55,302 --> 00:10:58,901
When your daughter is infected,
I'm gonna make you watch her die.

138
00:10:59,026 --> 00:11:02,580
Let her go! Let her go!

139
00:11:04,433 --> 00:11:07,234
You're running out of time, Stephen.

140
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,953
- Stephen, you're out of time!
- Stop! Stop! I'll tell you!

141
00:11:15,286 --> 00:11:17,757
Just don't harm her!

142
00:11:22,936 --> 00:11:25,294
How do I find the vials?

143
00:11:27,741 --> 00:11:31,136
Each one is tagged with a GPS locator chip,

144
00:11:31,266 --> 00:11:34,501
so that I can track them
right up until the moment they're released.

145
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:37,306
Where are the locator codes?

146
00:11:38,314 --> 00:11:41,628
- In my head.
- You memorized all 11?

147
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,431
Yeah. Get her out of there.

148
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:50,599
Bring Jane out from the tunnel now.
Let's go.

149
00:12:13,117 --> 00:12:18,243
Jack, we picked up 10 of the 11
GPS signals coming off the vials.

150
00:12:18,323 --> 00:12:22,116
- Why are we missing a signal?
- I don't know. I gave you the correct codes.

151
00:12:22,248 --> 00:12:23,729
Where's the 11th vial?

152
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:25,763
- Los Angeles.
- What's the target?

153
00:12:25,892 --> 00:12:30,608
He was told to select a public place where
maximum casualties would be inflicted.

154
00:12:30,738 --> 00:12:32,891
- What's his name?
- Arthur Rabens.

155
00:12:33,021 --> 00:12:36,540
- I'm assuming that's not his real name.
- We need a description.

156
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:38,818
Take him back to holding over at CTU.

157
00:12:38,948 --> 00:12:41,511
I want him working
with a sketch artist immediately.

158
00:12:41,592 --> 00:12:44,314
- What about Jane?
- She stays here.

159
00:12:54,167 --> 00:12:56,046
<i>- Kaufman.
- Adam, it's Jack.</i>

160
00:12:56,169 --> 00:12:59,563
I need you to do an all-agency search
on the name Arthur Rabens.

161
00:12:59,694 --> 00:13:02,336
<i>- Saunders believes it might be an alias.
- I'm on it.</i>

162
00:13:02,457 --> 00:13:05,020
Has District sent anyone over
to replace Tony?

163
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,219
Brad Hammond just got here right now.

164
00:13:07,343 --> 00:13:09,097
<i>- Let me speak to him.
- One second.</i>

165
00:13:09,225 --> 00:13:12,984
Mr Hammond, I have
Jack Bauer for you on line six.

166
00:13:14,952 --> 00:13:18,153
Jack, I've been briefed
on CTU activity to this point.

167
00:13:18,276 --> 00:13:22,719
We're relaying the coordinates of the 10 vials
to local police, NHS and Haz-Mat.

168
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:26,560
- We can't get a signal from the 11th vial.
- The 11th vial is in Los Angeles.

169
00:13:26,687 --> 00:13:30,604
The courier is Arthur Rabens.
Saunders believes that might be an alias.

170
00:13:30,731 --> 00:13:33,693
- There's no predetermined target.
- Is he telling the truth?

171
00:13:33,815 --> 00:13:36,457
Yeah. He thinks
we're willing to kill his daughter.

172
00:13:36,579 --> 00:13:40,941
<i>- But our best bet is to lock on to that signal.
- Everyone in comm is working on it.</i>

173
00:13:41,545 --> 00:13:45,383
Brad, I know you took
Tony Almeida into custody.

174
00:13:45,509 --> 00:13:48,346
But now his wife is safe,
he might be a real asset to us.

175
00:13:50,636 --> 00:13:53,199
There's not going to be
any special treatment.

176
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,158
For God's sakes, Brad.

177
00:13:55,281 --> 00:13:58,915
Four and a half years ago I was in
the same position Tony's been put in today.

178
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:01,004
Drazen kidnapped my wife and daughter.

179
00:14:01,088 --> 00:14:04,563
I went outside of CTU to get them back,
and no one put me in prison.

180
00:14:04,693 --> 00:14:08,372
- The circumstances were different.
- And the outcome will be the same.

181
00:14:08,498 --> 00:14:11,379
The operation was put at risk
because of what he did.

182
00:14:11,501 --> 00:14:14,975
This operation started a year ago
with Gael, Tony and myself.

183
00:14:15,106 --> 00:14:18,341
Gael gave his life, I became an addict
just to maintain my cover,

184
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:20,349
and now you're sending Tony to prison?

185
00:14:20,472 --> 00:14:24,834
It's wrong, Brad, and you know it. You
should put a medal on him, not handcuffs.

186
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:29,354
Jack, you can testify at his hearing.
Right now, we've got work to do.

187
00:15:15,459 --> 00:15:18,261
- Where's Michelle?
- She's here.

188
00:15:19,384 --> 00:15:22,220
- Could I talk to her, please?
- First things first.

189
00:15:22,308 --> 00:15:26,989
Plachecki from the attorney general's
office will take your official statement.

190
00:15:27,113 --> 00:15:29,266
You're entitled to have a lawyer present.

191
00:15:29,396 --> 00:15:32,870
Look, I don't need a lawyer, Brad.
I did what I did.

192
00:15:33,001 --> 00:15:37,761
What you did, Tony,
is punishable by the death penalty.

193
00:15:39,368 --> 00:15:42,125
- Death penalty.
- What did you expect?

194
00:15:42,252 --> 00:15:47,127
- You committed treason.
- That was not my intent.

195
00:15:47,258 --> 00:15:49,137
You facilitated the escape of a man

196
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:52,381
who was responsible
for the death of Ryan Chappelle

197
00:15:52,504 --> 00:15:54,338
and almost a thousand civilians,

198
00:15:54,467 --> 00:15:58,066
and who was contemplating
killing millions of others.

199
00:15:58,191 --> 00:16:04,672
You tried to neutralize the only leverage
we had by giving him back his daughter.

200
00:16:07,523 --> 00:16:10,086
So what's the bottom line?

201
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:16,650
I will testify to the fact
that your service record is long

202
00:16:16,774 --> 00:16:19,132
and, for the most part, distinguished.

203
00:16:19,257 --> 00:16:23,619
With luck, the best
you can hope for is 20 years.

204
00:16:36,278 --> 00:16:40,161
- Sherry should have left by now.
- Yeah, well, she's taking her time.

205
00:16:40,283 --> 00:16:42,720
So she can make the president wait.

206
00:16:48,813 --> 00:16:51,775
<i>- Wayne Palmer.
-  Wayne...</i>

207
00:16:51,897 --> 00:16:55,132
- I told you not to call me.
- I don't have anyone else.

208
00:16:55,261 --> 00:16:57,653
I'm sorry, but I can't help you right now.

209
00:16:57,784 --> 00:17:02,386
The police are coming back to arrest me,
Wayne, for murdering Alan,

210
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:05,073
because they don't believe
that Sherry was here.

211
00:17:05,153 --> 00:17:08,513
- I know what happened.
- Then why didn't you tell them the truth?

212
00:17:08,637 --> 00:17:12,840
My lawyer says that the president
is backing Sherry's story.

213
00:17:14,084 --> 00:17:17,842
<i>Is it true?
Is your brother covering for Sherry?</i>

214
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:22,925
- I... I don't know, Julia.
- Don't lie to me.

215
00:17:23,015 --> 00:17:27,377
Listen, I'm sorry, but there's nothing
I can do for you right now.

216
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:31,418
Please, just... don't hang up.

217
00:17:31,545 --> 00:17:35,098
I'll call you as soon as I can, I promise.

218
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:36,824
<i>Wayne.</i>

219
00:17:42,398 --> 00:17:44,756
I'm so scared.

220
00:17:44,881 --> 00:17:47,479
I know. I know.

221
00:17:47,605 --> 00:17:51,284
We loved each other once. Help me.

222
00:17:53,171 --> 00:17:55,051
- I have to go, Julia.
- Wayne...

223
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:57,452
I'm sorry.

224
00:18:30,617 --> 00:18:32,496
All right.

225
00:18:45,756 --> 00:18:49,834
I'm Chief of Staff to the president
and I'm committing a burglary.

226
00:18:49,961 --> 00:18:52,683
It's an historic moment.

227
00:18:52,804 --> 00:18:55,241
Foxton, Sherry can never know
we were here.

228
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:59,160
You do what I say and she won't.
Let's get to work.

229
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:08,453
Jack. Tactical feed from San Francisco.
They're apprehending Saunders' courier.

230
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:11,579
<i>- He's not breathing.
- Sniper took him down with a head shot.</i>

231
00:19:11,707 --> 00:19:13,985
<i>Got it.</i>

232
00:19:15,952 --> 00:19:20,873
<i>Is the vial intact? Field Ops,
I repeat, is the vial intact?</i>

233
00:19:20,999 --> 00:19:23,356
<i>Vial appears intact.</i>

234
00:19:24,683 --> 00:19:27,325
<i>We've got it. The vial is intact.
We have the vial.</i>

235
00:19:27,446 --> 00:19:29,804
One down, ten to go.

236
00:19:50,915 --> 00:19:54,629
- Did you check the kitchen?
- For the second time. There is nothing there.

237
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:59,122
Well, it looks like Mrs Palmer believes
in better living through chemistry,

238
00:19:59,245 --> 00:20:01,716
but none of the bottles are Alan Milliken's.

239
00:20:01,808 --> 00:20:03,802
- Dammit.
- Relax.

240
00:20:03,931 --> 00:20:06,209
If she's hidden it here, we'll find it.

241
00:20:06,334 --> 00:20:11,289
- How can you be so sure?
- Cos she's not a professional, and I am.

242
00:20:29,001 --> 00:20:31,279
- Sherry.
- David.

243
00:20:32,085 --> 00:20:35,399
- Let's take a walk.
- Actually, I just wanted to get to the point.

244
00:20:35,529 --> 00:20:38,331
What is it that you've decided?

245
00:20:41,256 --> 00:20:45,938
I've decided to give you what you want:
A place in my administration.

246
00:20:46,022 --> 00:20:47,981
That's what you implied over the phone,

247
00:20:48,265 --> 00:20:52,867
but I thought I was here
so that you could be a little more specific.

248
00:20:55,594 --> 00:21:00,958
You will be my de facto right hand,
involved in all major decisions.

249
00:21:01,081 --> 00:21:02,675
Involved how?

250
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:06,516
On everything from ambassadorial
appointments to legislative proposals.

251
00:21:06,647 --> 00:21:10,247
You will be one of my primary consultants.

252
00:21:12,615 --> 00:21:16,407
- One of your consultants?
- Right.

253
00:21:17,821 --> 00:21:20,577
- Goodbye, David.
- What? Where are you going?

254
00:21:20,704 --> 00:21:24,019
Back home,
because this conversation is over.

255
00:21:24,269 --> 00:21:26,236
- Why?
- That's just not good enough.

256
00:21:26,271 --> 00:21:28,742
I am not going to be relegated
to some informal role

257
00:21:28,874 --> 00:21:31,790
so that you can ignore me
whenever you choose.

258
00:21:31,918 --> 00:21:36,873
- Why don't you just tell me what you want?
- I want a permanent position, David.

259
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:40,045
In your administration and in your life.

260
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:43,647
I don't understand.

261
00:21:44,774 --> 00:21:46,812
I want to be your wife again.

262
00:21:48,619 --> 00:21:49,689
You what?

263
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:54,980
I don't expect to have the kind
of physical intimacy that we used to have,

264
00:21:55,106 --> 00:21:58,581
although maybe in time that'll come.

265
00:21:58,711 --> 00:22:02,948
But I really want to be
Mrs David Palmer again,

266
00:22:03,036 --> 00:22:08,754
the first lady, right by your side
in Washington, wherever you go.

267
00:22:19,216 --> 00:22:21,608
Sherry, I don't know what to say.

268
00:22:21,739 --> 00:22:26,978
You can start by saying yes...
or I walk for good.

269
00:22:30,189 --> 00:22:33,982
Are you prepared
to have me be your wife again?

270
00:22:53,858 --> 00:22:55,897
Yes.

271
00:22:56,021 --> 00:22:57,250
Really?

272
00:22:59,946 --> 00:23:01,939
Oh, David.

273
00:23:06,273 --> 00:23:08,267
Oh, God.

274
00:23:19,409 --> 00:23:22,086
We should talk about the details.

275
00:23:22,173 --> 00:23:26,376
Work out a timeline,
how we expose this to the public.

276
00:23:34,107 --> 00:23:36,305
Wait a minute.

277
00:23:38,753 --> 00:23:41,829
No, I know you
a little better than this, David.

278
00:23:41,957 --> 00:23:44,997
Something's not right here.
You're making this all too easy.

279
00:23:45,121 --> 00:23:47,763
There's something else going on.

280
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:52,645
- I'm giving you what you ask for.
- No, no, no, you're not.

281
00:23:54,132 --> 00:23:56,329
You're toying with me.

282
00:23:56,454 --> 00:23:58,925
And I don't know why
and, frankly, I don't care.

283
00:23:59,058 --> 00:24:03,215
You... you just consider my offer rescinded.

284
00:24:04,304 --> 00:24:07,903
John Keeler will be
the next President of the United States.

285
00:24:27,813 --> 00:24:29,726
- Yeah?
- She's on her way back.

286
00:24:29,855 --> 00:24:33,010
We need more time.
We haven't found anything yet.

287
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:37,492
I tried to keep her here,
but she knew something was wrong.

288
00:24:38,345 --> 00:24:40,703
- Wayne, you should leave.
- We're not done.

289
00:24:40,829 --> 00:24:43,426
She will be there soon.
You have no choice.

290
00:24:54,325 --> 00:24:56,683
David, hold on.

291
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:09,774
- There's a safe.
- We've found a safe in a hidden cellar.

292
00:25:09,904 --> 00:25:12,467
- Can you open it in time?
- Can you get in?

293
00:25:12,547 --> 00:25:15,782
It's an Evans-Stoller,
so forget about cracking it.

294
00:25:15,911 --> 00:25:18,907
These electronic safes
have manufacturer override codes.

295
00:25:19,035 --> 00:25:20,993
I have a guy who can get 'em for us.

296
00:25:21,118 --> 00:25:25,401
- How long?
- As long as it takes to get him on the phone.

297
00:25:25,483 --> 00:25:30,199
- David, we may have just found a way.
- You'd better. You're running out of time.

298
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:35,571
<i>The suspect used a titanium clamp to secure
the device to a railing. We're defusing it.</i>

299
00:25:35,695 --> 00:25:39,739
<i>- Wilson, what is your status?
- Suspect in custody. Virus is contained.</i>

300
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:42,058
<i>Yeah?</i>

301
00:25:42,183 --> 00:25:45,897
<i>Seattle, Las Vegas secure. Denver courier
taken down making a phone call.</i>

302
00:25:46,028 --> 00:25:48,750
Jack, we got the couriers
in Las Vegas and Seattle.

303
00:25:48,871 --> 00:25:51,149
Saunders' man in Denver
was making a phone call.

304
00:25:51,274 --> 00:25:54,190
- Did he complete the call?
- We don't know.

305
00:25:54,318 --> 00:25:56,710
We gotta find that out.

306
00:25:56,841 --> 00:25:58,960
<i> Vial is secure. We are secure.</i>

307
00:25:59,084 --> 00:26:01,840
I'm getting a level-two SAT transmission
from the LA grid.

308
00:26:01,927 --> 00:26:05,368
- Are you sure? What are the coordinates?
- Alpha 1733 and Delta 401.

309
00:26:05,492 --> 00:26:08,966
That's downtown. Lock in on the SAT feed.
Transfer to my screen.

310
00:26:09,096 --> 00:26:10,929
OK.

311
00:26:19,469 --> 00:26:21,029
- This is Jack.
- It's Chloe.

312
00:26:21,151 --> 00:26:24,272
- What have you got?
- Rabens is in Los Angeles.

313
00:26:24,395 --> 00:26:26,866
- Where?
- On South Flower heading northwest.

314
00:26:26,998 --> 00:26:29,196
We got a location.

315
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:33,000
Extrapolate his path and cross-reference it
with probable public targets.

316
00:26:33,125 --> 00:26:35,483
The most likely match
is the California Center.

317
00:26:35,608 --> 00:26:39,083
A mall makes sense. Get units over there
to evacuate and secure the area.

318
00:26:39,213 --> 00:26:41,411
We're on our way.

319
00:27:03,402 --> 00:27:06,603
I just tried to see Tony.
Security said you're denying me access.

320
00:27:06,726 --> 00:27:09,961
- He's a prisoner, Michelle.
- He did what he did to save my life.

321
00:27:10,091 --> 00:27:15,889
I'm aware of that. And because of that
he's being charged with treason.

322
00:27:16,018 --> 00:27:20,494
Treason? I know that he broke protocol
by taking Jane Saunders out of CTU,

323
00:27:20,623 --> 00:27:22,503
but he would never have given her up.

324
00:27:22,586 --> 00:27:26,630
- Because of him, we caught Saunders.
- We had Saunders two hours ago.

325
00:27:26,751 --> 00:27:29,746
Tony let him escape.

326
00:27:29,875 --> 00:27:33,919
No one told you? We had Saunders
trapped in a building downtown.

327
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:36,192
We were ready to drop the net,

328
00:27:36,322 --> 00:27:40,002
and Tony pulled units out of position
so Saunders could get away.

329
00:27:44,052 --> 00:27:48,335
- Brad, it was an impossible choice.
- No, it wasn't.

330
00:27:48,457 --> 00:27:51,294
Tony has a sworn duty
to protect the people of this country.

331
00:27:51,421 --> 00:27:56,626
Putting your life first was treasonous,
and he's going to prison for it.

332
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:02,266
- Brad...
- I want you to put yourself in his place.

333
00:28:02,354 --> 00:28:07,993
If you would have made the same call,
you should resign right now.

334
00:28:14,089 --> 00:28:16,560
<i>The target is moving north
at 40 miles per hour.</i>

335
00:28:16,692 --> 00:28:19,289
How long till we intercept?

336
00:28:19,415 --> 00:28:22,331
- About a minute.
- How are we doing on the other vials?

337
00:28:22,499 --> 00:28:27,020
They got the Flagstaff couriers and two
in Washington. Rabens is the last one.

338
00:28:27,104 --> 00:28:29,747
Next right. You should be
coming up right behind him.

339
00:28:29,868 --> 00:28:32,704
I'm turning right onto Flower.

340
00:28:35,755 --> 00:28:39,753
The target is less than a block ahead of you.
You should have a visual.

341
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:43,513
- There's no vehicles within range.
- You sure the target's in the vehicle?

342
00:28:43,605 --> 00:28:48,844
Of course. He's travelling 40 miles per hour.
Target is less than 50 feet ahead of you.

343
00:28:48,971 --> 00:28:54,496
There's no cars in front of us.
Recheck your signals. It's not possible.

344
00:28:54,618 --> 00:28:57,340
Yes, it is. He's underneath us.

345
00:28:57,461 --> 00:28:59,375
Chloe, the target's on the subway.

346
00:28:59,504 --> 00:29:02,067
Can you access
the MTA's disaster-response system?

347
00:29:02,187 --> 00:29:04,066
We can access their control center.

348
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:07,425
We need to stop the train in the tunnel
before it hits the station.

349
00:29:08,154 --> 00:29:10,718
Logging onto their system.

350
00:29:11,438 --> 00:29:13,636
Has Adam turned up a photo on Rabens yet?

351
00:29:13,761 --> 00:29:17,315
No. And Saunders hasn't
completed the identity sketch.

352
00:29:17,446 --> 00:29:21,045
They're accepting my request
to stop the train just short of the station.

353
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:24,086
- Shall I tell MTA to close the station?
- Absolutely not.

354
00:29:24,174 --> 00:29:27,170
If Rabens notices anything,
he might release the virus.

355
00:29:27,298 --> 00:29:31,501
I'm gonna need 20 personnel undercover
and a backup Haz-Mat team ASAP.

356
00:29:31,623 --> 00:29:35,826
We've got men nearby. I'll tell Hammond
to order the redeployment.

357
00:29:41,315 --> 00:29:43,593
<i>- Foxton.
- I've got those codes for the safe.</i>

358
00:29:43,718 --> 00:29:46,554
<i>- OK, give me the first one.
- 676765B.</i>

359
00:29:46,681 --> 00:29:49,518
676765B.

360
00:29:51,728 --> 00:29:54,005
- That didn't work. Got another one?
- Come on.

361
00:29:54,131 --> 00:29:56,124
<i>228767.</i>

362
00:29:56,253 --> 00:29:58,611
Did you hear that?

363
00:29:59,697 --> 00:30:02,534
<i>It was a car.</i>

364
00:30:13,274 --> 00:30:15,232
No.

365
00:30:16,478 --> 00:30:18,516
- Sherry's here.
- I need you to be quiet.

366
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,283
- We need to get the hell out of here.
- Quiet!

367
00:30:21,404 --> 00:30:24,160
<i>- The next one.
- Next one. 35266...</i>

368
00:30:24,287 --> 00:30:27,408
- Dammit, Foxton, come on!
- Got it.

369
00:30:33,699 --> 00:30:36,421
- It's not here.
- Dammit. All right, come on.

370
00:30:40,908 --> 00:30:43,584
- That's it, let's go.
- What?

371
00:30:43,671 --> 00:30:47,031
I didn't come this far to leave empty-handed.

372
00:30:51,601 --> 00:30:53,160
Wayne.

373
00:30:54,164 --> 00:30:56,043
What's going on here?

374
00:30:58,409 --> 00:31:00,322
Answer me. What...?

375
00:31:01,012 --> 00:31:03,006
Oh.

376
00:31:03,135 --> 00:31:06,529
Now I understand
why David wanted to meet me.

377
00:31:06,659 --> 00:31:10,372
But I am so surprised
to find you here doing his dirty work.

378
00:31:11,184 --> 00:31:14,864
I've never done anything to hurt you.
David put you up to this, didn't he?

379
00:31:14,989 --> 00:31:17,028
- Sherry, I...
- Answer me. David put...

380
00:31:44,265 --> 00:31:45,780
The eyebrows. Change the eyebrows.

381
00:32:03,889 --> 00:32:05,449
<i>Attention, passengers.</i>

382
00:32:05,571 --> 00:32:10,412
<i>Southbound services are temporarily
suspended due to a stalled train.</i>

383
00:32:10,537 --> 00:32:12,770
<i>We apologize for any inconvenience.</i>

384
00:32:17,505 --> 00:32:19,544
<i> Chase, what's your location?</i>

385
00:32:19,668 --> 00:32:22,026
<i>- I'm covering the east side of the tracks.
- Copy that.</i>

386
00:32:22,151 --> 00:32:26,149
<i> Chase, I've got a visual
on you coming down the stairs.</i>

387
00:32:28,278 --> 00:32:31,958
- Everything in place with the MTA?
- They're ready to move the train.

388
00:32:33,204 --> 00:32:37,168
<i>- Teams A and B, are you in position?
- Roger. We are in position.</i>

389
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:42,768
Rabens' description: Mid-30s, white male,
dark hair, brown eyes. Nondescript.

390
00:32:43,898 --> 00:32:47,690
- Chloe, release the train.
- Release the hold on the train.

391
00:33:31,115 --> 00:33:33,678
Train doors are opening.

392
00:33:37,763 --> 00:33:40,918
- Target is moving off the train.
- North or south?

393
00:33:41,047 --> 00:33:43,689
- North.
- Target is moving north.

394
00:33:43,811 --> 00:33:45,724
All teams remain in your zones.

395
00:34:04,115 --> 00:34:06,997
Chloe, can you check
the altitude on a GPS signal?

396
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:09,431
If I triangulate.

397
00:34:10,443 --> 00:34:14,885
- Target is changing altitude.
- Target's moving up the stairs.

398
00:34:16,931 --> 00:34:19,893
We've got ten remaining white males.

399
00:34:27,944 --> 00:34:30,860
Target is now moving west.

400
00:34:33,231 --> 00:34:36,352
Team A, split off and maintain pace.

401
00:34:37,316 --> 00:34:40,790
<i> Target is now moving south.
Target is now descending.</i>

402
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:47,083
<i> He's heading to the 7th Street
exit. Coming right towards you, Jack.</i>

403
00:34:51,493 --> 00:34:53,566
<i> Target is heading south.</i>

404
00:34:53,696 --> 00:34:57,010
I've got a visual.
Four white remaining males.

405
00:35:00,664 --> 00:35:05,266
I want all teams to start closing in.
I repeat, all teams start closing in.

406
00:35:09,956 --> 00:35:12,996
<i>- What have you got, Chloe?
- Target is now moving west.</i>

407
00:35:15,482 --> 00:35:18,842
<i> Target has stopped moving.
The target has stopped.</i>

408
00:35:23,612 --> 00:35:26,972
I have identification on the target.
White male at my six o'clock.

409
00:35:27,097 --> 00:35:31,334
He's looking at the map.
I'm initiating takedown.

410
00:35:36,628 --> 00:35:39,099
Drop the bag!
Get on the ground, now! Don't move!

411
00:35:39,231 --> 00:35:41,828
- What's going on?
- Where is it? Where is it?

412
00:35:41,955 --> 00:35:43,834
- Where's what?
- Chase.

413
00:35:43,957 --> 00:35:45,915
What are you guys doing? What's going on?

414
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,873
I've got a signal. Wait for Haz-Mat?

415
00:35:48,002 --> 00:35:51,157
No, it's either in the vial
or we're already contaminated.

416
00:35:52,487 --> 00:35:54,924
What is this?

417
00:36:06,344 --> 00:36:09,181
- Those aren't mine. I don't even...
- Shut up!

418
00:36:14,394 --> 00:36:17,435
- Son of a bitch.
- Just the transmitter. This isn't Rabens.

419
00:36:17,558 --> 00:36:21,636
He knows we're onto him. He's still got
the vial. Shut the station down now!

420
00:36:36,421 --> 00:36:37,981
Julia.

421
00:36:38,103 --> 00:36:40,825
- Stay here. I'll be right back.
- Where are you going?

422
00:36:40,947 --> 00:36:43,304
Just stay here.

423
00:36:50,839 --> 00:36:54,313
- Julia, what are you doing here?
- The police think I killed Alan.

424
00:36:55,644 --> 00:36:59,848
Well, I told you to keep your mouth shut.
It's nobody's fault but your own.

425
00:37:03,574 --> 00:37:07,288
What are you doing with a gun?
You don't wanna do this.

426
00:37:07,419 --> 00:37:10,859
I'm going to jail for the rest of my life
because of you.

427
00:37:11,704 --> 00:37:14,825
- Julia! Julia!
- That's not true, Julia.

428
00:37:14,948 --> 00:37:17,864
No, Wayne, relax. We're all right here.

429
00:37:17,992 --> 00:37:20,828
- You gotta put that gun down.
- No! No!

430
00:37:20,955 --> 00:37:23,712
She's the one who should be going to jail.

431
00:37:23,799 --> 00:37:26,600
My life is ruined.
Don't you understand that?!

432
00:37:26,722 --> 00:37:30,515
Julia, please, we can... We can work this out.

433
00:37:30,647 --> 00:37:32,526
He's right. We can work it out.

434
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:36,853
Shut up. Shut up!
You have been lying your entire life.

435
00:37:36,975 --> 00:37:40,494
- You are not gonna lie your way out of this.
- You're right.

436
00:37:40,619 --> 00:37:44,378
But right now, Julia,
I am telling you the truth.

437
00:37:44,504 --> 00:37:47,625
Now, I will go to David
and he will pardon you.

438
00:37:47,748 --> 00:37:50,504
I was just with him, just now.

439
00:37:50,632 --> 00:37:54,595
I'm gonna be his wife again.
He'll do whatever I say.

440
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:03,398
I promise you,
you will not spend one day in jail.

441
00:38:04,208 --> 00:38:06,771
Isn't that so, Wayne?

442
00:38:08,493 --> 00:38:11,968
Julia, listen, you'll have everything
you've always wanted.

443
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:18,420
You'll have your freedom,
you'll have Alan's estate.

444
00:38:18,586 --> 00:38:21,422
You just think about it, sweetie.

445
00:38:23,191 --> 00:38:24,751
I promise.

446
00:38:26,716 --> 00:38:31,351
You'll be set for life.
Good, good. That is real good.

447
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:36,036
That's good.

448
00:38:45,579 --> 00:38:48,893
Oh, my God. Sherry...

449
00:38:51,185 --> 00:38:52,415
Sherry...

450
00:38:57,273 --> 00:38:58,788
I'm so sorry.

451
00:39:00,957 --> 00:39:02,677
No!

452
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:11,922
God, no, please.

453
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:31,145
Take up position at the end of the platform.

454
00:39:32,516 --> 00:39:35,876
- We've detained everyone in the station.
- Did we shut it down in time?

455
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:41,877
- No one's left since the train came in.
- OK, start searching the tunnels.
