1
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,085
Tony Almeida has just informed us

2
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:19,795
that they were unable to confiscate
this Cordilla virus in Mexico.

3
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,085
This man Amador, where is he now?

4
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:26,636
Latest working theory is that Amador has this
virus and is headed back here to Los Angeles.

5
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,685
I let you live. Tell me what you know.

6
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,555
When Amador does business on the West
Coast, he washes his deal through Alvers.

7
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:38,159
- How does Amador contact this Alvers?
- I don't know. I've never met him.

8
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:43,829
<i>- Hello?
- Marcus, it's me. I'll be there in an hour.</i>

9
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,357
<i>- You got the virus?
- Yes.</i>

10
00:00:46,392 --> 00:00:48,395
- Just be ready.
- I will be.

11
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,590
- I've gotta go see Julia Milliken.
- No.

12
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,309
Don't go anywhere near her or Alan tonight.

13
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,790
- You think I'm scared of you?
- Julia. My pills!

14
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,072
- No, don't.
- What are you doing?

15
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,285
- Don't.
- Sherry.

16
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,198
<i> This is your way out.</i>

17
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:06,594
- We killed him.
- No.

18
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:12,114
There's one thing you have to be really clear
about when the authorities question you.

19
00:01:12,149 --> 00:01:13,876
I was never here.

20
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,950
- I got her.
- Agent Bauer.

21
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:02,113
I'm Jason Carasone from Division.
These men'll escort the prisoner to CTU.

22
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,920
- She doesn't leave my sight.
- You can accompany her in the lead van.

23
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,085
This is Carasone.

24
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,558
Yeah, he's right here. Agent Edmunds.
It's a Chloe O'Brian from your office.

25
00:02:18,593 --> 00:02:20,988
- Jack, I'll take another car.
- OK.

26
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,318
- Yeah, Chloe.
- Chase, they found out.

27
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:28,559
- Who found out what?
- Angela. They all know she's your daughter.

28
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,869
What? How?

29
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,830
The baby-sitter flaked.
She had an emergency and brought her here.

30
00:02:33,865 --> 00:02:36,876
- You brought Angela in to CTU?
- Your sister's out of town.

31
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,590
There is no one else.
You have no idea what I've been through.

32
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:45,111
OK. Chloe, thank you for covering.
I appreciate it, but where is Angela now?

33
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:49,991
She's downstairs with Marcy
until you get back.

34
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,232
Did Kim find out?

35
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,310
- Chloe, did Kim find out?
- Yes. Yes, Kim found out.

36
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:02,875
- How'd she react?
- Gosh, Chase, I think she's kinda pissed.

37
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,593
I'm coming back to CTU.
I'll take care of everything.

38
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,876
<i>Fine.</i>

39
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:14,597
Here's the situation. We believe Michael
Amador is in possession of the Cordilla virus.

40
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,885
We believe he is headed to Los Angeles
or is here already.

41
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,471
We estimate he has enough of the pathogen
to take out a major metropolitan area.

42
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,885
Our only lead is Nina Myers, who's
being brought back to CTU right now.

43
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:31,516
She thinks Amador is meeting with a man
in Los Angeles by the name of Marcus Alvers.

44
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,676
Adam's done a workup on him.

45
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:38,920
We have some background, but nothing
places him definitively in Los Angeles today.

46
00:03:38,955 --> 00:03:43,311
That's it? What about Interpol?
What do they have on Alvers?

47
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:48,111
Our data tracking's a little behind,
so we weren't able to access that report.

48
00:03:48,146 --> 00:03:49,512
Why are we behind?

49
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:54,430
We didn't update the European contact logs
while I was down.

50
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:59,833
- Michelle, you were the ranking agent.
- I didn't think Europe was a priority.

51
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,912
- Obviously it was.
- There was a lot going on at the time.

52
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,885
All right. Let's get back to work.

53
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:11,916
Let's try to ease up on the mistakes, as there
are millions of lives depending on us.

54
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,111
Michelle.

55
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,155
<i>Come.</i>

56
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,236
I just got off with CTU.

57
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,114
- What's the status on the virus?
- It's not good.

58
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,070
The limited intelligence they have
supports their suspicion.

59
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:42,194
- It's on its way to Los Angeles?
- David, it may already be here.

60
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,953
We should prepare in case
they target other cities.

61
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:50,079
Our people in the security envelope
have been alerted. It's being handled.

62
00:04:50,114 --> 00:04:52,712
Why don't you try and go get some rest?
I'm on this.

63
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,759
<i> Mr President,
Mrs Palmer's here to see you.</i>

64
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,272
Send her in, please.

65
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,000
Start waking people up. Set up
a conference call with the cabinet members -

66
00:05:06,035 --> 00:05:09,576
Homeland Security, FBI,
National Health Services.

67
00:05:09,611 --> 00:05:13,118
- We're gonna need everyone on this one.
- Yes, sir.

68
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,756
Wayne.

69
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,200
Sherry, I asked you here to help me,
not make things worse.

70
00:05:25,235 --> 00:05:28,112
I did not want you going
to Alan Milliken's house.

71
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,192
Relax, David. I didn't go there.

72
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,165
- You didn't go?
- No.

73
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:39,000
When we spoke on the phone, you told me it
was crucial that you speak to Julia in person.

74
00:05:39,035 --> 00:05:42,834
Yes. And I changed my mind.
I spoke to her over the phone.

75
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,765
- About what?
- About Kelly's disappearance.

76
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,793
I asked her if she would check
Alan's cellphone for any recently made calls.

77
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,117
- And?
- She wouldn't do it.

78
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:05,400
You don't take no for an answer, Sherry.
What aren't you telling me?

79
00:06:05,435 --> 00:06:07,765
Nothing, David. I swear.

80
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,951
What have you been up to
if you weren't at Milliken's?

81
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,356
- Making calls.
- You could have made them from here.

82
00:06:14,391 --> 00:06:17,312
Yes, but I didn't.
I parked on the side of the road.

83
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,119
I started making calls
because I didn't wanna wait.

84
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,836
I told you, we have a small window
of opportunity here.

85
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,151
I wanted to exploit the fact
that Milliken may not have had time

86
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,149
to cover his tracks
when he had someone grab Kelly.

87
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,156
All right.

88
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,195
- I have other things to attend to.
- OK.

89
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,237
- Is there anything else?
- That's it.

90
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,715
Hello, Nina. Take her to Interrogation 819.

91
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,356
Yes, sir.

92
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,913
- What's the security configuration?
- Don't worry. We're handling Nina.

93
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,829
- Ryan, you know what she's capable of.
- That's none of your concern.

94
00:07:29,864 --> 00:07:32,030
- I'm sending you to Medical.
- I'm fine.

95
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:36,239
- I don't think you are.
- What's this about?

96
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,837
We found evidence
you've been injecting heroin.

97
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,317
Tell me I'm off here, Jack. Tell me I'm wrong.

98
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:50,798
- I didn't think so.
- Ryan, I haven't missed a step. I'm fine.

99
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,358
I have to cover my ass.
I need to get you checked out.

100
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,630
You're wasting time.

101
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,270
- Kim.
- Yeah.

102
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,965
I thought you'd wanna know your dad's back.

103
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,037
- What about Chase?
- He's a few minutes behind him.

104
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,556
Thank you.

105
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,275
- Kim.
- Dad.

106
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,356
Oh, God. Hi.

107
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,754
- She's here.
- I know, sweetheart. I know.

108
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:20,554
Look, I have to debrief Chappelle.
I'll see you in a minute, OK?

109
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,358
Dad, I know about your drug problem.

110
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,272
Why didn't you come to me with this?

111
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,095
Come here.

112
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:38,991
Come here.

113
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,556
I'm sorry, baby. I'm sorry.

114
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,116
I was embarrassed.

115
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:54,756
And it wasn't your problem, and it still isn't.

116
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,636
I didn't want you to worry.

117
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,718
Well, is it over?

118
00:10:01,753 --> 00:10:04,236
No, not exactly.

119
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:10,149
I think I'm gonna have to go
into a programme, get some help.

120
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,355
- I'm so sorry.
- It's OK.

121
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,959
Look, Chappelle wants me to go
into the clinic and get checked out.

122
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,159
We'll talk about this later, OK? Don't worry.

123
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,958
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

124
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,365
Jack.

125
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,358
I'm glad you're back.
It's been difficult without you.

126
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,356
Thanks, Chloe.

127
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,991
- Chase.
- Yeah?

128
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,675
I need to talk to you about the baby.

129
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,749
Why don't you take a few minutes
and then meet me in my office?

130
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,991
Mr Milliken?

131
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,391
Mr Milliken?

132
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,552
Oh, my God.

133
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,670
Mrs Milliken!

134
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,956
Come quickly!

135
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,191
Quickly!

136
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,355
Hey. How's the hand?

137
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:52,074
It's fine. How'd Chappelle find out?

138
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,438
I don't know. It doesn't really matter.
What's going on?

139
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,180
Almeida'll interrogate Nina.
I'll follow it from a feed.

140
00:11:58,215 --> 00:12:00,880
Good. Make sure Tony puts
double security on the doors.

141
00:12:00,915 --> 00:12:03,314
Get back to me as soon as
she gives you anything.

142
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:08,317
- Agent Bauer, keep pressure here.
- Sure. Thank you.

143
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:15,193
Jack, you're about to find something out
about me that's not gonna make you happy.

144
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:19,429
- What are you talking about?
- Excuse me. Do you mind?

145
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,440
I've got a daughter.

146
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,873
- A daughter?
- Her mother dropped her off and she split.

147
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:38,436
- It's a long story.
- Does Kim know about this?

148
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,159
Yeah.

149
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,238
From you?

150
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,358
I haven't had the chance
to talk to her myself yet.

151
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:51,713
You square this with her, Chase.
You understand me? You just make it right.

152
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,917
And get back to me
as soon as Nina gives you anything.

153
00:12:54,952 --> 00:12:56,836
I will.

154
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,877
- Are we up yet?
- Yep. Video's piped in. Voice analysis.

155
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,953
- Vitals. Transcription. All set.
- Nick, do you copy?

156
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,277
<i>- I read you.
- We're ready to go.</i>

157
00:13:20,312 --> 00:13:22,275
<i>Recording to hard drive now.</i>

158
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,710
- So Tony's doing this?
- Yeah.

159
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,630
Is that gonna be weird for you?

160
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,316
- What do you mean?
- Didn't he and Nina go out?

161
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,154
Yeah.

162
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,992
- We set?
- Yeah.

163
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:48,176
All right. I want you to do
a high res on her eyes.

164
00:13:48,211 --> 00:13:52,273
She's tired. We might be able to pick up a tell.

165
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,515
OK.

166
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:01,668
- So are we all right?
- Yeah, we're fine.

167
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,389
All right. Let's do this.

168
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:15,590
I got the high res on monitor two.

169
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,713
Tony.

170
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,833
Didn't know I was gonna see you today.

171
00:14:25,868 --> 00:14:28,472
You know what we want.

172
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:33,317
We need to find Michael Amador
before he unloads the virus.

173
00:14:33,352 --> 00:14:35,748
I already told Jack everything I know.

174
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,869
I want you to tell me.

175
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:44,670
First Jack, now you.
What does that remind me of?

176
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:53,877
You told Jack that Amador
might try to contact a Marcus Alvers?

177
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:00,158
So, where do we look for Alvers?

178
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:05,314
It's a nice ring. Who's the lucky girl?

179
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:12,034
Hope you did a background check cos you
don't wanna make the same mistake twice.

180
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:16,353
You're going back to prison. There's
a good chance you'll be executed as a traitor.

181
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:21,474
You know if you cooperate you may be able
to save your own life, but you're stalling.

182
00:15:21,509 --> 00:15:24,750
Which means you know something
and think there's a play you can make,

183
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,758
only now's not the right time.

184
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,469
Very incisive.

185
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:35,755
I hope your wife appreciates that about you.

186
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:42,113
Why don't you tell me about Alvers?

187
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:46,836
All I know is that he works only with Amador.

188
00:15:46,871 --> 00:15:48,436
I don't know him personally.

189
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:53,158
All we've been able to dig up on him
are a few random medical records

190
00:15:53,193 --> 00:15:55,071
under one of his known aliases.

191
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:58,472
He had an MRI on one of his knees.

192
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,438
There's a prescription for antibiotics.

193
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,675
Treated for HIV.

194
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,270
Her pulse is spiking.
Someone hasn't been using protection.

195
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,313
She's probably had sex with him.

196
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,840
See, Nina, my colleagues in the next room

197
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:23,229
are telling me that something
in those medical records concerns you.

198
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:28,040
I'm guessing it's not the knee.

199
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,912
Marcus.

200
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,996
Michael.

201
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,205
- How was your trip?
- Interesting.

202
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,152
I still don't understand
why you risked so much in Mexico,

203
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,800
why you didn't come here directly.

204
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:20,277
240 million dollars made it worth the risk.

205
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,205
What about Nina?

206
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,958
If she wasn't killed by the bomb,

207
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:34,431
I'm sure her buyers took care of her once
they found out she didn't deliver the virus.

208
00:17:34,466 --> 00:17:36,474
Either way, she's out of the picture.

209
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:40,589
I hope so. She can point to both of us.

210
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:46,479
We'll be long gone
before anyone starts looking.

211
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,756
Kim.

212
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:16,394
- I know we haven't talked since I got back.
- No, we haven't.

213
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,598
I know what you must be thinking.
Give me a chance to explain.

214
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,405
I don't know what to think.

215
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,638
Look, I'm happy that you're OK,
but this thing...

216
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:29,110
You have a baby, Chase.

217
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:32,596
We've been together more than three months
and you kept this secret.

218
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:37,040
- Who's the mother? Where does she fit in?
- That's what I wanna talk about.

219
00:18:37,075 --> 00:18:40,715
- I didn't know until a month ago.
- How could you not know?

220
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:44,594
Angela's mother and I
went out last year. It's over.

221
00:18:44,629 --> 00:18:47,805
And when it ended,
she never told me she was pregnant.

222
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,879
She calls a month ago and tells me
she has a baby and that I'm the father,

223
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:55,635
and that she's in trouble
and she can't handle it.

224
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,398
I was afraid to let people find out.

225
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:03,876
I was afraid it was gonna mess us up.

226
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:07,316
- But you told Chloe.
- Chloe and my sister have been helping me.

227
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,313
She's a good friend.

228
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:15,677
Excuse me. Chase, you wanted me
to let you know when Angela woke up.

229
00:19:15,712 --> 00:19:17,396
- Thank you.
- Sure.

230
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,715
Kim, I'm just as confused as you are.

231
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,910
But all I know is that I love you,

232
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:31,712
and I'm falling in love with Angela, too,
and I need to make this work.

233
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,196
Go on.

234
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,476
Hey.

235
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,989
- What's happening with Nina?
- They're getting something.

236
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,759
The connection between
Alvers and Nina might be deep.

237
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:08,158
You better hope she's not spinning your
wheels cos she can manipulate our protocol.

238
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,005
- Tony knows what he's doing.
- Fine.

239
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:13,510
I need to get together with Chloe.
I need everything she's got on Amador.

240
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:16,040
- Not yet.
- Ryan, you're wasting my time.

241
00:20:16,075 --> 00:20:18,405
I humored you with the physical.

242
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:22,340
We both know there'll be trace amounts
of opiates, but enough is enough.

243
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:26,240
Rae Plachecki from the inspector general's
office is here to talk to you.

244
00:20:26,275 --> 00:20:29,198
- This is not the time.
- Actually, it is.

245
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:34,234
You'll talk to her, then we'll evaluate whether
you can go back to work or not. Come on.

246
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,915
Rae Plachecki, this is Jack Bauer.

247
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:50,670
You know the drill. I'm gonna ask you
some questions, but I'm on your side.

248
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:54,992
We wanna establish that this heroin addiction
was a necessary part of your cover.

249
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:58,874
It was necessary to maintain my cover.
Are we done now?

250
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,435
Sit down, Jack.

251
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:13,605
This is Rae Plachecki. The time is 2.31am.

252
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,757
Interrogation of Jack Bauer,
director of field ops, CTU.

253
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,605
Ryan Chappelle is present.

254
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:24,589
Jack, tell us how you established
your cover with Ramón Salazar.

255
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:28,749
I first came in contact with the Salazars
approximately two years ago.

256
00:21:28,784 --> 00:21:31,154
They were an up-and-coming
narcotic cartel in Mexico.

257
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,718
<i> So when did you meet Amador?</i>

258
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,635
Did you know him
when you were working at CTU?

259
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:52,269
Tell me something, Nina. What kind of a deal
do you think you're gonna cut?

260
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:57,353
You've betrayed everybody you know,
including me.

261
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:01,075
You murdered Jack's wife.

262
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:05,925
You helped terrorists smuggle
a nuclear bomb into this country.

263
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:11,557
You're helping to unleash a deadly virus
into the general population.

264
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,190
Help me understand this.

265
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,394
What do you want?

266
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,714
What is it you get
out of being a mass murderer?

267
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,428
Your neck is bleeding.

268
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:10,439
- Dalton, what have you got?
- So far the only reactions are subliminal.

269
00:23:10,474 --> 00:23:12,913
If she won't talk we need
to be plugged into her vitals.

270
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,435
We can take her to seven,
do a passive-response test.

271
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:19,712
Seven's not secure enough. She stays here.

272
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,797
- Where's Richards?
- He's waiting.

273
00:23:22,832 --> 00:23:25,115
Let's bring him in.

274
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,599
<i> Send Darren in.</i>

275
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:56,472
Nina, I don't think you've met Darren
Richards. He joined us after you left.

276
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,390
Hello, Darren.

277
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:08,719
Don't take it personally. He doesn't talk much.

278
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:33,352
<i> Something's
not connecting up for me, Jack.</i>

279
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,356
You weren't in with the Salazars
until early February,

280
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:39,352
but the first time you started using
was late December.

281
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:43,638
That's six weeks of shooting up for the
benefit of no one. Am I missing something?

282
00:24:43,673 --> 00:24:46,711
I was trying to pass as a junkie.
I wanted to be prepared.

283
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:51,119
- What do you mean, prepared?
- The Salazars lived in the drug world.

284
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:56,150
If I couldn't handle the narcotics,
they'd have known I was a cop and killed me.

285
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:59,072
- I needed to be able to handle it.
- That makes sense.

286
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:03,915
But in January, when you were injecting,
you didn't have a meeting on the books.

287
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:07,794
- It could have been a year for all you knew.
- What are you saying?

288
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:12,438
I am trying to establish evidence
that you did drugs as part of your cover.

289
00:25:12,473 --> 00:25:14,874
If I submit this, it's not gonna hold up.

290
00:25:14,909 --> 00:25:16,910
What do you want me to say?!

291
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:21,950
I did drugs to get in with these people
and I got in with them!

292
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:28,037
No matter how difficult it's been,
I don't use any more.

293
00:25:28,072 --> 00:25:31,714
Look, I'll write it up that way
and maybe it'll fly,

294
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:37,234
but I think you'll have a problem because
you never told anyone, not even your partner.

295
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:39,872
That's suspicious.

296
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:45,325
Rae, you know my history.

297
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,511
I've had a very difficult time
since my wife passed away.

298
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:54,592
If I told anyone I was using drugs to develop
a case, they would have misinterpreted it.

299
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,952
I couldn't afford that risk.

300
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:02,033
Yeah, well, that's what they're gonna do now.

301
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:08,036
Rae, let's put down that Jack started
using heroin in late January,

302
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,833
after the first meeting with Salazar
was established.

303
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:14,835
I appreciate what you're trying to do,
but that's not what happened.

304
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:16,955
Just trying to save us all some paperwork.

305
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:20,914
- I'm OK with that.
- I'm not.

306
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:27,080
I started using in December.
I've got nothing to hide.

307
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:32,957
This office demands results
and that's what I provide - results.

308
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:38,914
- Fine.
- Can I get back to work?

309
00:26:38,949 --> 00:26:40,751
Not quite yet, Jack.

310
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,190
He'll be here in an hour.

311
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:59,195
Just as long as we have enough time to leave
the country before they let this virus out.

312
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,310
Please be seated.

313
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:13,918
Five hours ago I went public with a statement
that there was a domestic terror threat,

314
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:16,325
but it had passed.

315
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:19,325
And now it appears that that was premature.

316
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:25,360
Ladies and gentlemen, do we or do we not
have a threat of this virus being released?

317
00:27:25,395 --> 00:27:29,638
Sir, I'm afraid we can't answer that question
with any kind of certainty.

318
00:27:29,673 --> 00:27:31,152
What can you tell me?

319
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:36,195
What few leads we have indicate that Michael
Amador has the virus and is in Los Angeles.

320
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:39,125
For what purpose we can't say.

321
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:42,914
Then we have to prepare for defensive action
here in Los Angeles,

322
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,669
and, for that matter, in all our major cities.

323
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:49,325
<i>Mr President, you know our position
here at Homeland Security.</i>

324
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:55,629
<i>We think being forthright and making such
preparations in the open is the correct course.</i>

325
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,315
We have to assess
the downside of that course.

326
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:03,635
<i>I have no problem with that, as long as
we realize we are working against a clock.</i>

327
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:08,911
I want all departments present to work up
an open versus covert containment strategy

328
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,925
and report back to me in 30 minutes.

329
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,960
In the meantime, I want
Health Services to issue guidelines,

330
00:28:13,995 --> 00:28:17,430
but only to be distributed internally.

331
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:21,075
That is all. I'll be in my office.

332
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,596
David.

333
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:35,350
- Give us a second, please, Aaron.
- Of course, sir.

334
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:47,396
Secret Service just received a phone call from
the West Los Angeles Police Department.

335
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:51,599
- Alan Milliken is dead.
- What?

336
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:57,756
He was found 15 minutes ago in his home.
All signs point to a heart attack.

337
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:02,194
- It isn't possible.
- Well, apparently, it is.

338
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,525
You told me Sherry was on her way
over there about an hour ago.

339
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:14,669
She changed her mind, made some phone
calls from her car, came straight back here.

340
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:18,118
David, is that what she told you?

341
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,525
Yeah.

342
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:24,473
- And where is she now?
- Resting.

343
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:32,956
- Aaron, take me to Sherry.
- Yes, sir. She's right this way.

344
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,125
- Hasn't your shift ended?
- I stayed on.

345
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:40,039
I sensed it's a difficult day
and I wanted to be here for you.

346
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:43,796
- I appreciate that.
- Right in there, sir.

347
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,515
- Sherry.
- David.

348
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:00,072
- What's wrong?
- Alan Milliken is dead.

349
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:04,150
- What? How?
- Why don't you tell me?

350
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,235
What do you mean?
I told you I didn't go there.

351
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:11,319
I know what you told me. You sat in your car,
made some calls and came here.

352
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,073
That's the truth.

353
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:17,717
Then you won't mind the police checking
your cellphone and the car you used tonight.

354
00:30:17,752 --> 00:30:24,511
You know, you asked me
to take care of a problem, and I did.

355
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:28,960
If you want the police to check phone logs,
then have them check yours first.

356
00:30:28,995 --> 00:30:35,229
Remember, you called me tonight.
I am here because of you, David.

357
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,920
What happened, Sherry?

358
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:57,829
I went over to the house,
just to speak to Julia.

359
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,714
Alan interrupted us,
there was an argument and...

360
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,954
...he had a heart attack.

361
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:23,556
There's going to be an investigation.
You're gonna have to tell the truth about this.

362
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:27,030
The truth isn't gonna save either one of us.

363
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:32,148
All they're going to hear
is that I was there on your behalf

364
00:31:32,183 --> 00:31:34,793
to prevent Alan from meddling
with your presidency

365
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,520
and that he died from natural causes.

366
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:44,752
<i>How do you think that's gonna play out in
The New York Times for the next six months?</i>

367
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,920
What did you do to Alan?

368
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:53,154
Honestly, David?

369
00:31:56,560 --> 00:32:00,792
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

370
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,276
Kim, I transferred that feed.
Do you want me to pull it up for you?

371
00:32:07,311 --> 00:32:08,479
Yeah.

372
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:23,317
She won't give him anything.
We're gonna have to find Alvers.

373
00:32:23,352 --> 00:32:25,509
What can I do?

374
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:30,113
I followed up on his Asian connections,
but there's something for you to look at.

375
00:32:30,148 --> 00:32:32,155
- It's a long shot.
- What is it?

376
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:37,399
A list of cities Alvers has been in the last
three years, each time for a couple of days.

377
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:42,230
Cross it with the other suspects.
Let me know what you come up with.

378
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:53,272
I don't know why we have to go
through this again. I already answered that.

379
00:32:53,307 --> 00:32:56,431
- What is it, Edmunds?
- Just wanted to give you an update on Nina.

380
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:00,918
- Rae, could you pause that?
- Did she give us anything new on Alvers?

381
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,152
No. Other than the probability she knew him
personally, she's not cooperating.

382
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,509
What are we doing?

383
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,068
Richards is working on her now.

384
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:14,165
- I think that's a mistake.
- Why?

385
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:17,749
I don't think anybody should be in there
that hasn't worked with her.

386
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:21,676
- She'll manipulate him.
- All Richards does is inflict pain.

387
00:33:21,711 --> 00:33:24,790
There's no way for her to manipulate him.

388
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,755
Right.

389
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:45,034
How much more of this
do you wanna endure, Nina?

390
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,798
I think this is about it.

391
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,197
- She hit an artery!
- Call Medical!

392
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,555
She's bleeding! We gotta take her there now.

393
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:01,319
- Tell security we need an escort!
- We need Medical.

394
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,909
<i>-  Uncuff her.
-  Now!</i>

395
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,111
So what did Sherry have to say?

396
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:26,165
- That Alan had a heart attack.
- And you believe her?

397
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:31,672
I'd be a fool to believe
anything Sherry says to save herself.

398
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:36,751
But murder... I can't imagine she'd do that.

399
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,833
We can't allow ourselves
to be caught off guard.

400
00:34:39,868 --> 00:34:43,109
Now, we have to assume the worst.

401
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:47,388
Then we'd also have to assume
that Julia was somehow involved.

402
00:34:47,423 --> 00:34:49,873
What?

403
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,589
Whoa, whoa. Listen.

404
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:57,993
David, I'm sorry, but Julia's
not the same kind of person that Sherry is.

405
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:03,233
When we find out all the facts,
we'll proceed from there.

406
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,868
I have to go over
the morning brief with Jerry.

407
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,356
All right.

408
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:28,319
<i>- Hello?
-  Julia, it's me.</i>

409
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,365
Wayne?

410
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,870
I just heard about Alan, and I...
Are you alone?

411
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,949
The police are here. I was just going
to speak with one of the officers.

412
00:35:38,984 --> 00:35:41,109
All right, tell me what happened.

413
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:44,749
Sherry was here when it happened,
but she told me not to tell the police.

414
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,360
I need for you to tell me
exactly what happened.

415
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:53,557
We were talking with Alan. He got excited.

416
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:56,165
Then he started to gasp for air.

417
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:59,112
- He gets angina.
- So you called 911, right?

418
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:04,920
- No, no. I tried to give him his medication.
- What do you mean, you tried?

419
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:11,918
Sherry stopped me.
I went to help Alan and she grabbed my arm.

420
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:18,111
I just stood there. I couldn't move. I...

421
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:23,272
- I killed him, Wayne.
- Shh. Listen, be careful here.

422
00:36:23,307 --> 00:36:24,965
- I killed him.
- Call Alan's lawyer.

423
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:31,439
And do not say anything, anything, to anyone
until he gets there. You understand me?

424
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:34,398
Wayne, could you come down here
and help me?

425
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:37,114
No, and please don't call me.

426
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:41,275
I will help you, but for right now
I have to keep my distance. I'm sorry.

427
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,030
<i> Come on, let's go!</i>

428
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:55,389
One, two, three.

429
00:36:56,680 --> 00:37:00,719
<i> The carotid's been lacerated.
Start a twilight drip.</i>

430
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,438
- Clamp.
- Clamp.

431
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:07,190
- Line, please.
- Keep steady pressure.

432
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,432
- Got it in?
- Yeah.

433
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:14,956
<i>-  3-0 silks.
-  3-0 standing by.</i>

434
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:18,872
<i>-  More gauze.
-  Gauze.</i>

435
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,075
<i>-  Got it open.
-  Clamp it.</i>

436
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,918
Here you go, Doctor.

437
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:26,433
<i> Keep the pressure on.</i>

438
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:30,195
<i> Let's get some more gauze in here.</i>

439
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,838
<i> She's under.</i>

440
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:37,074
I want you two stationed right here. Do not
leave unless you hear directly from me.

441
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:48,678
Those are all the questions I'm obliged to ask.

442
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,713
<i> If you've got anything to add,
now's the time.</i>

443
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,836
That's my statement, as it is.

444
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:58,116
My God! Tony!

445
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:02,439
Nina tried to commit suicide.
She jammed her neck into Richard's needle.

446
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:05,274
- Where is she now?
- In the clinic being operated on.

447
00:38:05,309 --> 00:38:07,372
- Who's with her?
- She'd sedated...

448
00:38:07,407 --> 00:38:09,436
<i>Tony, who's with her?!</i>

449
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,359
Dammit!

450
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:33,075
Which way'd she go?

451
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,645
Lock down the building!

452
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:40,549
This is Ryan Chappelle. Nina Myers
is loose in the building. Lock it down - now!

453
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,596
Nina.

454
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:40,240
Drop the gun. Put your hands on your head.

455
00:39:40,275 --> 00:39:42,231
Now!

456
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:49,277
Kim, what the hell are you doing?

457
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:53,273
- You don't wanna be any part of this.
- Shut up.

458
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:58,269
Just turn around and walk away.

459
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,590
If you leave now, you won't get hurt.

460
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,276
Kim.

461
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:14,116
Don't do it, Nina. I swear to God I'll shoot you.

462
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:17,113
- You won't kill me.
- Nina, dammit.

463
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,800
Kim, back up. Back up.

464
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:30,032
Kim, go back into CTU.
Tell them we've got Nina.

465
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,796
- Dad, we need...
- Kim, go now.

466
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,510
Please, baby. Just go.

467
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:58,840
You don't have any more
useful information, do you, Nina?

468
00:40:58,875 --> 00:41:00,592
I do.

469
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:11,312
No, you don't.
