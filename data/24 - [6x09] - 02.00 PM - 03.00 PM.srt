1
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,751
That's hyoscine pentothal.

2
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:19,960
You will experience pain I can't even describe.
At eight ccs I risk inducing a heart attack.

3
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,439
Four ccs.

4
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,159
That's eight ccs.
His vitals are spiking across the line.

5
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:24,956
Four ccs!

6
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,714
The connection you found
between Dad and Gredenko

7
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,519
had to do with a contract
that was awarded to us.

8
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,160
What did a general
have to do with a contract?

9
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:40,314
It was his job to release the old nukes
into the US for decommissioning.

10
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,118
- He knows you didn't tell him everything.
- I won't, Dad.

11
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,395
I have to be sure.

12
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,594
I'd like you to appear on television and
appeal to members of Islamic communities

13
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,478
to come forward
with any information on Fayed.

14
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,154
I can't reach out to them for help.
I know you can.

15
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,037
Fayed already called me a traitor.

16
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:13,113
Many others will follow if there is
a suspicion I am an American puppet!

17
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,352
Not a puppet, a partner. At least when
it comes to finding these nuclear weapons.

18
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:21,274
The presidentjust rejected
every one of my proposals.

19
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,679
That a change in leadership is imperative
to ensure this nation's security.

20
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,274
I'm not talking about holding hearings.

21
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:31,193
Something more immediate
would have to happen.

22
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,558
- This is the engineer?
- You've got the wrong man.

23
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:39,433
You're going to modify this
so that I can use it to reprogram the bombs.

24
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,112
You will do it.

25
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,875
How much pain will be
inflicted on you before you comply?

26
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,710
Stop!

27
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,915
I'll do it.

28
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,396
Arm it.

29
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,629
Very good.

30
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,319
Fayed's already gone.

31
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,914
The reprogramming device
Fayed had me build -

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,468
if it's not here,
it means he took it with him.

33
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,712
And with it, he can activate
the other bombs he has any time he wants.

34
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,759
Let's go.

35
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,638
<i>- (phone rings)
- Yes.</i>

36
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,713
I have the arming device,
but I had to leave one of the suitcases behind.

37
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,236
- What happened?
- CTU found me.

38
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,118
I needed to preoccupy them
with a bomb to enable my escape.

39
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:24,194
The delivery system software
was programmed for five detonations

40
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,748
at five high-priority targets.

41
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,549
Because of your carelessness,
we are now down to three.

42
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,029
More than enough for our needs, Gredenko.

43
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,396
Just make sure the delivery system
arrives on schedule.

44
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:42,350
The trucks have left Nevada.
They'll reach the location within two hours.

45
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:46,752
Good. Use the time
to reprogram your targeting software.

46
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,400
Call me when it's completed.

47
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,675
The FAA couldn't track Fayed's chopper.

48
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:04,435
We have to assume it's somewhere
outside the containment area.

49
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,478
We may not know where Fayed is,
but we know he has a device

50
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:11,951
enabling him to activate the three
remaining suitcase nukes in his arsenal.

51
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,837
Our only potential lead

52
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,311
was uploaded from a laptop hard drive
recovered by Jack and his team. Milo.

53
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,313
There was an email fragment I restored
from the hard drive.

54
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,598
It referenced recent communications
between Fayed and Dmitri Gredenko.

55
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,750
Gredenko is the former Soviet general

56
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,957
who turned over Russian nukes
to the US for decommission.

57
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,713
He was the source of Fayed's weapons.

58
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,715
Gredenko is more involved than we realised.
What's his interest in helping Fayed?

59
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:45,318
Gredenko is an ultra-nationalist. His desire
to harm this country is in synch with Fayed's.

60
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:49,871
- Any updated intel on his location?
- Interpol confirmed he's not in Moscow.

61
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:54,317
Since the point-of-origin fingerprint
on the email was Pacific time,

62
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,598
it's safe to assume he's somewhere
on the West Coast, possibly Los Angeles.

63
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:04,073
Run a data sweep through INS and customs.
See if we can track how he got in the country.

64
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,752
- Morris.
- We have to take him to Medical.

65
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:25,072
- I want to talk to him. Are you OK?
- Give us ten minutes.

66
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,039
- Bill.
- Jack.

67
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,554
- Did you pull anything off the drive?
- We have.

68
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,108
Fayed was in contact with Dmitri Gredenko.

69
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:58,034
- Gredenko?
- Perhaps aided Fayed's operation all along.

70
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:01,271
- You think he's in LA?
- Evidence on the drive points to that.

71
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,713
What leads on Gredenko?

72
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,475
Your father's company was to dispose of
the nukes Gredenko was to hand over.

73
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,154
My brother oversaw those contracts,
not my father.

74
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,277
- He might have information.
- I'll talk to him. Where is he?

75
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:16,319
He went to see
your brother's body in the morgue.

76
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,595
OK, thanks.

77
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,753
- Chloe, are you all right?
- Yeah. Thank you for saving Morris's life.

78
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,796
Yeah.

79
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,589
I'm really glad
Fayed didn't kill you this morning.

80
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,999
Me too.

81
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:40,156
I have to talk to my father.
I just want to thank you for everything.

82
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,919
<i>(beeping)</i>

83
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,752
Dad.

84
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:05,270
Whatever your brother may have done,
he didn't deserve this.

85
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,953
I didn't mean for this to happen.

86
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,868
Yeah, well...

87
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,680
Dad, I'm sorry about Graem.

88
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,479
I am.

89
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,714
But right now, CTU wants to know about
your connection to Dmitri Gredenko.

90
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,077
What?

91
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:35,392
We believe he's working with Fayed.
They want to know what you know about him.

92
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:40,110
He was the Russian liaison on our contracted
decommissioned Soviet nukes. Why?

93
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:45,069
<i>- What dealings did you have with him?
- Couple of calls to Moscow. That's about it.</i>

94
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:49,517
Does Gredenko have contacts allowing
Fayed to remove the remaining four nukes?

95
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:55,038
Look, Jack. Like I told you,
I had virtually no involvement.

96
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,793
Graem oversaw the project.
He dealt with Gredenko.

97
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,713
Whatever you need to know died with him.

98
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,196
Do you know where Marilyn is?

99
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:09,670
No. Why? You gonna question her too?

100
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,195
She's probably with Josh.

101
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:22,831
He's taking the death of his father pretty hard.

102
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,480
Leave them alone, Jack.

103
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,950
Let them grieve in peace.

104
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,271
I'll make a call
to some of the company executives.

105
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,759
About Gredenko.

106
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:39,875
Maybe Graem shared something
that I wasn't privy to.

107
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,873
Thank you.

108
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,389
Try to rest.
You're doing very well.

109
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,191
You can go in now.

110
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:19,432
Morris?

111
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,750
How are you feeling?

112
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,757
- Say something.
- What is there to say?

113
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:36,835
You were tortured.
You held out as long as you could.

114
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:40,390
- I armed a nuclear bomb.
- You had to. Fayed was gonna kill you.

115
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,074
I wish to God he had.

116
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:47,836
Because of me, Fayed has a device that can
arm all the bloody suitcase nukes he wants.

117
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,319
You can't blame yourself.

118
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:53,678
When the next bomb goes off
and thousands more people die,

119
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:58,515
everybody will remember
that I was the one that made it possible.

120
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:04,513
That's not gonna happen. We'll find Fayed
and stop him, and none of this will matter.

121
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,637
- Are you any closer to finding him?
- No.

122
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,715
Just go, darling.

123
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,236
Go.

124
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,190
<i>(phone rings)</i>

125
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:43,909
- Yes, Mr Bauer.
- We got a problem. Gredenko is here.

126
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,275
In LA? Are you sure?

127
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:51,593
Yes. Only they don't know where he is.
We've got to get to him before they do.

128
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,399
If Gredenko implicates me, everything -

129
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,792
the company I founded, spent my life
protecting - it's over, understand?

130
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,996
Yes. I'll put a team together.

131
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,752
I'll monitor CTU from here.

132
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,354
- If I hear anything, I'll call.
- Yes, sir.

133
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,150
I don't care what you have to do.
You find Gredenko and you kill him.

134
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,639
<i>Understood.</i>

135
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,830
I talked to my father about Gredenko.

136
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:26,310
He'll make some inquiries,
but he doesn't know anything.

137
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,152
The news here isn't better,

138
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,791
but Milo traced the fragment he pulled off
Fayed's computer to a local IP network.

139
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:38,159
It confirms Gredenko is definitely here in LA.
I got my people monitoring chatter,

140
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,153
data-mining backlogs on Gredenko's
activities prior to going underground.

141
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,356
- Right now, that's all we can do.
- OK.

142
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,150
Have a seat, Jack.

143
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:55,831
- What is it?
- Toxicology report on your brother's body.

144
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:00,198
Forensic evidence indicates
the hyoscine pentothal you gave to Graem

145
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:03,909
during his interrogation caused his coronary.

146
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:08,789
There's something else.
I saw the field tape

147
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,553
and Rick Burke's report for Division.

148
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,789
He said you exceeded protocols
after he warned you of dangerous levels.

149
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:20,795
- That's true. Agent Burke tried to warn me.
- Then you pulled a gun on him.

150
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:26,630
You realise how this looks,
coming after he tried to kill you.

151
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,789
I lost control.

152
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,394
You found out he was behind
Palmer's assassination.

153
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:35,873
Yes, I found out he was behind Palmer's
assassination. I found out about everything.

154
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,473
I lost control.

155
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:44,839
I tried to tell you
I didn't think I could do this - this job.

156
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,835
I wanted to kill my brother.
I wanted him dead.

157
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:57,359
I was standing over him and I looked up
and I saw my father in the doorway,

158
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,273
and then everything just stopped.

159
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:06,709
I ordered Agent Burke
to shut down the IV. He did.

160
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,360
I thought we got it in time.

161
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:22,797
Bill, I did not set out to kill my brother.

162
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,598
I swear to you.

163
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:42,153
I can adjust the report
before I send it to Division.

164
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,639
- No!
- Jack.

165
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:48,396
An investigation will impede our search
for Fayed and Gredenko. You are critical.

166
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,119
You cannot cover this up.

167
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:56,069
I ordered Agent Burke
to administer the hyoscine pentothal.

168
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:04,754
I killed my brother. Whatever
the consequences are, I accept them.

169
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:11,908
Bill, do this right.

170
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,717
OK.

171
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:23,148
I'll submit the report as is.

172
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:45,556
There is some difficulty with my statement?

173
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:49,150
More emphasis on religion
and less on politics than I expected.

174
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:54,109
Many of the people you wish me to sway have
been persuaded that our cause is a holy one.

175
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,839
I am not innocent in this manipulation.

176
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:01,232
So I must address them in these terms
if I am to enlist their cooperation.

177
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,470
<i>- (knock on door)
- Yes.</i>

178
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,874
Excuse me, sir.

179
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:10,750
Vice President Daniels is calling for you.
Would you like to take it in your office?

180
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,957
No, I'll take it in here. Thank you.

181
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,438
Excuse me.

182
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:24,557
Noah?

183
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:27,791
Thanks for taking my call.
I know you're pressed for time.

184
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:28,676
<i>What can I do?</i>

185
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:36,394
I'm disappointed you rejected Tom Lennox's
plan for mass internment of Arab nationals.

186
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,914
The plan did not delineate country of origin.

187
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,790
It was a blanket proposal to arrest
and detain thousands of Muslims living here.

188
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,518
Without due process.

189
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:50,390
Since, as I understand it,
the terrorists have acquired the capability

190
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,951
to arm the three remaining nuclear weapons,
I'm asking you to reconsider.

191
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,112
I thought I told you
my decision was not open for debate.

192
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:04,116
That's unfortunate, since the majority of your
cabinet feels you're making a tragic mistake.

193
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:08,876
I respect that. But I believe that
our best chance of stopping further attacks

194
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:13,476
will come from the intelligence
drawn from Islamic communities.

195
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:18,958
And you hope to obtain that
by letting a known terrorist leader

196
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:22,077
address the world on American airwaves.

197
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:27,319
The man has murdered countless innocents
over the past 20 years

198
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:31,313
and you are putting your hopes
for this country's safety on him.

199
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,436
Not entirely.

200
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,954
But to the extent that he can help us, yes.

201
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,917
Mr President,

202
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,757
you approached me cos you knew I'd deliver
voters who questioned your experience,

203
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:53,153
who were afraid that your presidency
would be too weak on national defence,

204
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:58,598
and I assured them otherwise.
But now you're proving them right.

205
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,951
There is a thin line
between conviction and stubbornness.

206
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:09,512
You can stand firm,
butjust know that you are standing alone.

207
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,749
Are we done?

208
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:12,916
Clearly.

209
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:26,038
You are paying a very high price
for doing this.

210
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:29,237
Not as high as my country will pay
if I'm wrong.

211
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:33,279
As someone who's alienated followers
by choosing the unpopular course,

212
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,750
I suggest you tread carefully
among your people.

213
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:44,309
- Mr Assad, our cultures are very different.
- It's notjust a cultural issue, Mr President.

214
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,198
It's simple human nature.

215
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:53,477
They will come after you.
I assure you of that.

216
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:26,316
- Are you sure it's safe to talk in here?
- Yes, this area is currently unmonitored.

217
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:33,192
All right. You intimated you had some
sort of plan of dealing with the president.

218
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,352
Palmer's refusal to implement your proposals

219
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:40,558
will unquestionably lead to the loss
of many more American lives.

220
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,315
And I and many others like me
who love this country

221
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,313
will not stand by idly and let that happen.

222
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,393
- So what is it you propose?
- I think you know.

223
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,793
I need to hear.

224
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,952
Definitive action.

225
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,677
We are in a national crisis
and he is in over his head.

226
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:07,150
He has brought this on himself.

227
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,759
Listen, before you start
reconsidering and report me,

228
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:21,356
just know, I will deny
that we ever had this conversation.

229
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,432
No. I'm not...

230
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,113
I'm not reconsidering.

231
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:33,433
I know what you're saying is necessary.
I just cannot believe it has come to this.

232
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:42,392
- Who else is involved?
- You don't need to know that.

233
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,553
- I'd like to know who I'm dealing with.
- Right now you're dealing with me.

234
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,712
Vice President Daniels - is he involved?

235
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,792
No. The vice president
doesn't know about this.

236
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:58,034
But we do know that he shares our sentiment
in regard to the current state of affairs

237
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:03,592
and that he will enact your initiatives
once he has the power to do so.

238
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:08,196
- You seem pretty certain this is gonna work.
- More so with your help.

239
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:16,075
I need the president's itinerary, specifically
in regards to Assad's televised address.

240
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,879
I do not have the clearance.
I need you to access it.

241
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,757
Why? Why do you need this?

242
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:27,595
Dammit, Reed. We're talking about
removing the President of the United States.

243
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,352
Do not keep me in the dark here.

244
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:35,197
I never said that I was the architect of this.
I'm just a conduit. Besides, for your sake,

245
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:40,798
I think that it is very important we maintain
a certain level of plausible deniability.

246
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,156
The less you know the better.

247
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,110
I'll get you that itinerary.

248
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,758
- Marilyn.
- Hi.

249
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,956
I heard you were with Josh.
I didn't want to disturb you.

250
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:29,672
Yeah, well, he's taking it pretty hard.
He loved his father very much.

251
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,355
- I'm very sorry.
- You don't owe me an apology.

252
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:37,510
Maybe they haven't told you the
circumstances of Graem's heart attack.

253
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,398
They told me enough.

254
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:44,589
Look, Jack,
I know the kind of man Graem was.

255
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:50,234
Even if he did die because of your
interrogation, I don't blame you. I blame him.

256
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:57,115
Truth is, I've been trying
to leave Graem for years.

257
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,794
But he threatened to take Josh away from me.

258
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,110
He said I'd never see him again.

259
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,317
- Did Josh know what he was like?
- No.

260
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,312
I tried to protect him
from the truth about his father.

261
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,198
What have you told him
about his father's death?

262
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:16,751
Only that he had a heart attack.
It's enough for now.

263
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:19,308
Yeah.

264
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:22,437
I'm sorry. I have to go back to work.

265
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,711
If there's anything I can do...

266
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,752
- Is it true there are more bombs out there?
- Yes.

267
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,354
Are you any closer to finding them?

268
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:39,719
No, we hit a roadblock. We're looking for
a Russian operative helping the terrorists.

269
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,030
- Graem knew him.
- Russian?

270
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:46,670
A man named Gredenko.
You know him?

271
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,234
No.

272
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,595
Come here.

273
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,718
But you know something.

274
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:11,637
Maybe. It-it was probably nothing.
It was months ago.

275
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:16,316
Marilyn, anything you can tell us might help.

276
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:23,351
Graem was going out a lot at night. He said
it was work related, but I didn't believe him.

277
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:28,036
I thought he was having an affair on me,
so one night I followed him.

278
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:31,590
It wasn't out ofjealousy.
It was for leverage -

279
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:35,958
anything I could use against him
to get custody of Josh if I left him.

280
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:40,352
- Where did he go?
- It was to a house in West LA.

281
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:45,036
I went to the window. The blinds were drawn,
but I could hear him inside,

282
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,192
talking to some men.
They had Russian accents.

283
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,679
What were they saying?

284
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:54,959
I couldn't hear them clearly. Frankly, once
I realised he wasn't cheating, I went home.

285
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,759
- Do you remember the address?
- No.

286
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,469
Sorry, I didn't pay attention.
I was concerned about getting caught.

287
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:05,109
Marilyn, it is vital that we find Gredenko.

288
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:10,274
If we retrace the route you took that night,
do you think you'd recognise the house?

289
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,396
Maybe.

290
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,835
Maybe?

291
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:19,118
Yeah. Yeah. I think so.

292
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,714
Wait right here.

293
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,152
Jack.

294
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,674
I think I might have a lead on Gredenko.

295
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:47,070
It's a shot in the dark,
but right now we don't have anything.

296
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:50,789
I wanted to know if I had
your permission to follow it up.

297
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,871
What have you got?

298
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,349
- Hey, Marilyn.
- Hey, Phillip.

299
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,750
- How you doing?
- I'm hanging in there.

300
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:05,396
What's goin' on with you and Jack?

301
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:08,711
He's looking for someone.
He thinks I can help.

302
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,916
You mean Gredenko?

303
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,629
He questioned me
about the same thing earlier.

304
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,156
- What do you know about him?
- Nothing, really.

305
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:23,314
I followed Graem to a house one night.
He, um... He met with some Russians.

306
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:27,871
- What house?
- I don't know. It was in West LA.

307
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:32,238
Jack wants to take me over there
to see if we can jog my memory.

308
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,348
Phillip,

309
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:40,356
I don't know how long this is gonna take
and I can't leave Josh alone.

310
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,635
- Could you please stay with him?
- Yeah, sure.

311
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,398
- That will do. Thanks.
- Thanks.

312
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,438
Your TAC team is assembling.
I'm sending Milo with you.

313
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,509
Milo? Why?

314
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:56,559
I want a tech to pull intel off computers
we find at Gredenko's location.

315
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,473
- Chloe will be running point from here.
- Fine.

316
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:04,634
I'm sorry about leaving you. I'll be back
as soon as I'm done helping Uncle Jack.

317
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,836
Helping him with what?

318
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:09,639
And where are you going?

319
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:14,350
I'll explain later. Right now I want you
to stay here with your grandfather.

320
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,759
Marilyn.

321
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:26,353
Maybe I ought to take Josh back to my house.

322
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:29,989
Why? Why can't you just
wait with him here until I get back?

323
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,038
He's frightened of this place.
Understandably so.

324
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:37,716
I think he needs to be
in familiar surroundings right now.

325
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:43,996
All right. All right,
I'll clear it with Mr Buchanan.

326
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,072
- Will you explain things to Josh?
- Yeah, sure.

327
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:55,633
All right, you listen to your grandfather.
He's in charge.

328
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:01,353
- Phillip, thank you.
- Sure.

329
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,635
Sorry to take you away from Josh.

330
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:11,235
All you need to do is identify the house.
I will not put you in danger.

331
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:15,632
I know. Mr Buchanan, I'd like Josh's
grandfather to take him back to his house.

332
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,233
Of course.

333
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:22,271
We should go.
Bill, I'll be on comm.

334
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:27,795
We'll be leaving soon, Josh. I have to make
one phone call. Just be a minute.

335
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:40,995
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

336
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,548
Have your men find and secure
a house in West LA.

337
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,995
Fine. I'll text you with the address.

338
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:08,593
We have a lead. Jack's sister-in-law
thinks she knows where Gredenko is.

339
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:12,150
Jack and a TAC team are heading there.
I need help running Tactical.

340
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,754
Don't be ridiculous.

341
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:18,150
We're short-handed,
so get your shirt on and let's go.

342
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,789
Running Tactical is what you do best.
Why would you need my help?

343
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:27,118
Oh. I get it.
You came in here to give me a pep talk.

344
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:31,034
Get me back behind that computer
and everything will be tickety-boo.

345
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:35,193
You should be a little less obvious, Chloe.
I'm a coward, not an idiot.

346
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:43,353
Morris, I know you've been through a lot
today, but you're really starting to piss me off.

347
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:48,712
Well, let's add that to my list of failings.

348
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:55,557
- Why did you do that?
- I didn't want to.

349
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:00,439
Look.

350
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:05,719
If you're gonna try and save a bloke,
save someone who's worth it.

351
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,833
Stop it. Stop it.

352
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:13,310
Jack and his team are entering
a hostile situation and need backup.

353
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:18,872
Yes, I can do it alone. But there would be
less chance of a mistake if you would help.

354
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:23,272
So why don't you stop feeling
sorry for yourself and get back to work?

355
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,199
We just passed 98th Street.

356
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:38,398
Roger that, Jack. We're maintaining
our position six blocks behind you.

357
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:46,991
I can't imagine
what you went through in China, Jack.

358
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:55,157
When you were over there,
I thought about you.

359
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,117
I tried not to.

360
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:01,838
I guess I've been trying
not to think about you for over 20 years.

361
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:05,993
- We don't need to talk about this.
- It was your father, wasn't it?

362
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:10,790
He drove you away, tried to
pressure you to work for his company.

363
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:14,429
Is that why you left?
Enlisted in the military?

364
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:17,478
There were a lot of reasons.

365
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:20,233
Was I one of them?

366
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,869
No.

367
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,078
<i>(phone rings)</i>

368
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:34,712
Hello?

369
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,268
It's me. Don't say anything, just listen.

370
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:41,114
I don't want Jack to know
I'm on the line, you understand?

371
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,269
OK.

372
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:46,717
You're involved in something
much bigger than you can possibly imagine.

373
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,268
So here's the deal:

374
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:55,071
unless you do exactly what I say,
I will hurt Josh.

375
00:31:55,160 --> 00:32:00,314
If you don't believe that, you might consider
this: Graem's death was not an accident.

376
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:04,598
I killed him.
I want you to say, "Thank you, Susan".

377
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:10,030
Thank you, Susan.

378
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:12,873
You won't take Jack
where Graem met the Russians.

379
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:18,910
<i>You're gonna take him to a different address -
9407 Hindry Place. You got it?</i>

380
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,029
<i>- Yeah.
- Good.</i>

381
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:26,193
Now, you do this for me,
and I promise you you will see Josh again.

382
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,236
If you don't, he dies.

383
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:37,157
<i>- OK.
- 9407 Hindry Place. Do the right thing.</i>

384
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:41,870
I already lost a son today.
Don't make me lose a grandson.

385
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,231
Goodbye, Susan.

386
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:52,434
- You all right?
- Fine.

387
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:55,990
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

388
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:00,596
It was my office. A lot of the roads
are still shut because of the bomb.

389
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,750
- Can we get home?
- No.

390
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:06,549
- And no one knows when they'll open up.
- So what do we do?

391
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,791
We'll go to a hotel.
We can stay there until they clear up.

392
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:34,038
Marilyn, is any of this familiar?

393
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:36,111
Yes.

394
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,910
Jack?

395
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,195
What?

396
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,551
What is it?

397
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:52,356
It's nothing. I thought I saw the house,
but I was wrong.

398
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:01,914
Oh, that was it. Hindry Place.

399
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,275
Milo, we got a street. Hindry Place.

400
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:08,319
Copy that, Jack.
Relaying it to CTU now.

401
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,558
How long before
the new targets are reprogrammed?

402
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:18,915
20 minutes.

403
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:23,674
You still think you can trust the Arabs?

404
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,149
They serve their purpose.

405
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:30,035
Our country lost the Cold War

406
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:35,035
because it was afraid to use these weapons
against the Americans.

407
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:43,315
Today we will correct that mistake.

408
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:46,472
And the Arabs will take all the blame.

409
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:03,389
<i>(man on TV) There's no telling
what this explosion will do...</i>

410
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,755
All right, we're on it. Chloe!

411
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:11,039
Marilyn remembers where she believes her
husband met with Gredenko - Hindry Place.

412
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,712
Is she sure?

413
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,872
That's what she told Jack.
Pull up all access roads in the area.

414
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:19,839
I'm in the middle of reconfiguring the uplink.

415
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,115
I'll put Morris on it.

416
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,794
Your call.

417
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:51,829
I know you're lying to me, just like my mom.

418
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:55,071
You're all treating me
like I'm some stupid little kid.

419
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:58,038
- What?
- I wanna know why my dad died.

420
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:00,395
What's your mom said?
It was a heart attack.

421
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:05,474
I know, but I know he was doing
something illegal or whatever and...

422
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:10,156
But nobody's telling me what it was
and I just want to know.

423
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,270
Did it have to do with the nuke?

424
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:18,798
Look, Josh. You'll hear a lot of things about
what your father may or may not have done.

425
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:22,236
I'm not gonna pretend
it's gonna be easy for you.

426
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:27,792
You know no matter what,
I'm gonna be there for you.

427
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,871
That's it - the blue house on the right.

428
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,359
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

429
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:51,274
We've got an address - 9407 Hindry Place.

430
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:56,195
Have CTU bring up the schematics of the
house. Meet me in the alley behind the target.

431
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,872
All right, I'm on it.

432
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,876
Hold on.

433
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:31,709
We're going after the blue house. Tell them
nonlethal force. We need Gredenko alive.

434
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:34,598
- Jack.
- Stay in the tactical van. You'll be safe there.

435
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,477
- But I have...
- Jack.

436
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,950
There are two entrances -
one in front, one on the west side.

437
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:45,114
I'll contact CTU when we've got Gredenko in
custody. Stay with Marilyn. Your men ready?

438
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,634
- We're set.
- Let's go.

439
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,316
All teams go. Go!

440
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,114
Go, go!

441
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:28,152
Bomb! Everyone out!

442
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,993
Jack!

443
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,638
- We gotta go. Come on.
- No!

444
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:41,269
Get in the van. Get in the van! Close the door!

445
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,396
Jack. Jack, can you hear me?

446
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,840
- Oh, they're coming!
- Get up. Come on!

447
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:35,229
Move, move! Get down, get down!

448
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:40,598
Don't hit the woman!
We need her alive!

449
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,873
Move. Come on, come on. Move.

450
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,633
Go, go, go, go. Don't stop!
