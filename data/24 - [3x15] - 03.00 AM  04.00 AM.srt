1
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,596
Alan Milliken is dead.
All signs point to a heart attack.

2
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,085
What happened, Sherry?

3
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,476
I went to the house to speak to Julia.

4
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,685
There was an argument
and he had a heart attack.

5
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:29,474
- I need you to tell me what happened.
- I tried to give him his medication.

6
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,309
- What do you mean, you tried?
- Sherry stopped me.

7
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,885
We believe Amador
is in possession of the Cordilla virus.

8
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,913
He is either headed to LA or is here already.
Our only lead is Nina Myers.

9
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:43,590
She thinks Amador is meeting with
a man by the name of Marcus Alvers.

10
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,075
- What about Nina?
- She's out of the picture.

11
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:49,112
I hope so. She can point to both of us.

12
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,598
I'll give you an update on Nina.
Richards is working on her.

13
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,085
<i>-  I think that's a mistake.
- Why?</i>

14
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,590
I don't think anybody should be in there
that hasn't worked with her.

15
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:02,190
All he does is inflict pain.
There's no way for her to manipulate him.

16
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,278
<i> Nina, I don't think
you've met Darren Richards.</i>

17
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,198
- How much more do you want to endure?
- I think this is about it.

18
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,278
<i>-  Damn! She hit an artery.
-  Call Medical!</i>

19
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,992
<i> Take her now!</i>

20
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,680
- Nina tried to commit suicide.
- Where is she?

21
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,680
<i>In the clinic being operated on.</i>

22
00:01:21,715 --> 00:01:22,669
Dammit.

23
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,235
- Drop the gun. Put your hands on your head.
- You won't kill me.

24
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,515
Nina. Dammit.

25
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:33,273
You don't have any more
useful information, do you?

26
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,685
I do.

27
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,438
No, you don't.

28
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,514
Tony.

29
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,318
- What happened?
- Nina Myers is dead.

30
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,034
- How?
- Jack shot her.

31
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,637
Chappelle's on his way
to talk to him right now.

32
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,680
Was it... justified?

33
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:08,508
Jack wouldn't risk this operation
just to get vengeance.

34
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,480
Are you sure about that?

35
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:23,285
This is the gun I used.
Send it over to ballistics for a match.

36
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:28,189
Secure this area till Forensics gets here.
And pull the surveillance footage off of there.

37
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:30,759
- Jack. Can I have a word?
- Just give me a minute.

38
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,351
- No, Jack. Now.
- Look, it's OK. I'm all right. Go.

39
00:02:34,386 --> 00:02:36,475
I'll be right back.

40
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,470
- What happened?
- Nina tried to escape.

41
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,676
I know that. How did she get shot?

42
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,793
She pulled her gun.
I pulled mine in self-defence.

43
00:02:45,828 --> 00:02:47,397
- Just like that?
- Just like that.

44
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,285
Nina was our best chance for this virus.

45
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,710
She was a material witness
in an ongoing investigation.

46
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,388
I know exactly what she was, Ryan.

47
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:02,320
- Division'll want me to certify this shooting.
- Then do it.

48
00:03:02,355 --> 00:03:06,757
- Come with me and look at security playback.
- Fine.

49
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,870
- Kim, you all right?
- Yeah, I'm OK.

50
00:03:09,905 --> 00:03:11,829
I got here as soon as I heard.

51
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,798
I've got to go with Chappelle.
I'll be back as soon as I can.

52
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:18,674
- I'll stay with her, Jack.
- It's OK. I'm fine.

53
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,830
- She tried to kill me.
- It's over, OK? Your father stopped her.

54
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:32,113
- Yeah, except I don't know what happened.
- What do you mean?

55
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:35,995
He told me to leave the room
and I heard shots.

56
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,885
Kim.

57
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,912
You're safe, OK? And that's all that matters.

58
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:46,229
I don't know. Ever since she killed my mother
I've been wanting Nina dead,

59
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,793
and now that she is,
it's not gonna bring my mother back.

60
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,830
And I just didn't think
I was gonna feel this way.

61
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,190
How do you feel?

62
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,676
I'm not sure.

63
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,788
It's OK.

64
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,076
Come on.

65
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,871
He's here.

66
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,714
We were getting worried.
We have a job to do.

67
00:04:47,749 --> 00:04:50,114
You've got plenty of time.

68
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,838
<i>-  I'm curious.
- About what?</i>

69
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,045
Why you chose such a limited target.

70
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:05,189
Why not the airport or sports arena? If the
objective was to inflict maximum casualties...

71
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,910
That's not the objective.

72
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,354
Not yet.

73
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,638
Then why are you doing this?

74
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,636
To send a message.

75
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,155
Most of you know, but for those who don't,

76
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:33,158
Jack killed Nina
while she was trying to escape custody.

77
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,193
- Division specified we use nonlethal force.
- It's over, Chloe. She's dead.

78
00:05:37,228 --> 00:05:40,429
So how will we find the virus?
Nina was our only connection to Alvers.

79
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:45,870
Not necessarily. We were on to Alvers
because he was Amador's contact in LA.

80
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:50,396
- The search order for Amador is still active.
- Technically, but we've exhausted all leads.

81
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:56,312
Then run 'em again and widen the parameters.
Cross-refer transactions, itineraries, aliases.

82
00:05:56,347 --> 00:05:58,913
We're still assuming
Amador's in LA with the virus.

83
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:05,394
That's right, and the Russians have just sent
us some intel that supports that assumption.

84
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,880
It's a detonating device, part of the Soviet's
biowarfare arsenal till late 1980s.

85
00:06:09,915 --> 00:06:12,599
It disperses pathogens
throughout the atmosphere.

86
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,872
Three weeks ago, a dozen
were stolen from the Ukraine.

87
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:20,080
We believe Alvers and Amador are arming
these devices with vials of the virus,

88
00:06:20,115 --> 00:06:23,834
which means we all have to work fast.
So let's get going.

89
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:34,077
Place the vial here. To actually arm
the device, flip switches one and two.

90
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:39,952
Then wait ten seconds and flip
the third switch, which activates the timer.

91
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,358
When the timer goes off...

92
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,045
- What's the dispersal radius?
- Hundred meters.

93
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:55,552
The dispersal rate increases geometrically
depending on wind and weather.

94
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,993
- Better than I thought.
- I made some modifications.

95
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,869
So, Michael...

96
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,831
tell me how it went down in Mexico.

97
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,438
You didn't think I would find out.

98
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,595
I didn't think you needed to know,

99
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,831
as long as you got what you wanted.

100
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,556
You were stupid enough to believe
Bauer had turned against CTU,

101
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,245
now you've got every agency
in the country after you?

102
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:49,114
- Bauer's story checked out.
- Don't presume to tell me about Jack Bauer.

103
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:54,600
What you did in Mexico was stupid, greedy
and it may have cost me my advantage.

104
00:07:54,635 --> 00:07:56,999
Alvers and I still expect to be paid.

105
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,870
The authorization code is 7QV78.

106
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:18,150
- This is only half.
- The balance on confirmation on the hotel.

107
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:23,912
- The deal was we get paid in full.
- The deal changed when you went to Mexico.

108
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:29,434
Now, after you've hit the hotel,
you'll get the rest of your money.

109
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,836
Fine.

110
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,076
Adam.

111
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,674
Gotta comb through these.
If it isn't important, I don't have time.

112
00:08:51,709 --> 00:08:54,949
- I think I have a thread on Amador.
- What are you talking about?

113
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,355
A gold certificate account
registered to an alias.

114
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,994
It's a Zurich bank,
but was activated locally.

115
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,165
- When?
- Just a few minutes ago.

116
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,165
- Kim. I need a backtrace.
- What's going on?

117
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,909
- A bank that may be talking to Amador.
- What's the sequencing program?

118
00:09:08,944 --> 00:09:10,950
Beta One.

119
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:16,320
- If this is real, how long to tag the location?
- Five minutes. Ten, tops.

120
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,995
- She was down when you shot her.
- She was going for her gun.

121
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,753
- That's what you keep telling me.
- It's the truth.

122
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,357
You knew where the camera was. You stood
in front of it to obscure any visual record.

123
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:35,193
- Ryan, she was going for her gun.
- I wish I could believe that, but I don't.

124
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,473
For God's sake,
there's something called due process.

125
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,394
It's why we've got judges and juries and laws.

126
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:45,554
Don't you dare tell me about the law.
Nina killed my wife and they let her go.

127
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,152
And she would have killed my daughter
if I hadn't gotten there when I did.

128
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:53,765
Using drugs to maintain your cover
is one thing, I looked the other way,

129
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:58,000
but I've got to answer to my bosses about
the questionable death of a key witness.

130
00:09:58,035 --> 00:09:59,991
- Sir.
- We're in the middle of something.

131
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,365
- I assume finding the virus is a priority.
- What do you got?

132
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:08,030
We may have Amador. A Zurich account
registered to an alias was accessed locally.

133
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,350
- We'll have an origin soon.
- Field teams.

134
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,478
- Tony's on it.
- Jack. This isn't resolved yet.

135
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,160
- We have a live lead.
- What do I tell Division?

136
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,910
That I let you stay on active duty
while still under investigation?

137
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:23,338
- It's my ass on the line.
- I've been working with Jack all day.

138
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:26,476
He's operating at a higher level
than anybody else, including me.

139
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,200
- I didn't ask your opinion.
- I'm giving it.

140
00:10:29,235 --> 00:10:31,191
Excuse me?

141
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,397
Sir, if this lead turns out to be real,
we need Jack on-site.

142
00:10:35,432 --> 00:10:37,839
And, believe me, you will want him there.

143
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:42,591
They'll crucify me
if I let you back out in the field.

144
00:10:42,626 --> 00:10:44,755
Would you give me a minute?

145
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,989
This is your call, Ryan.

146
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,796
I understand the position you're in,

147
00:10:55,831 --> 00:10:58,993
but I give you my word, I can do my job.

148
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,556
Thank you.

149
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:26,880
Listen, Julia, I thought I was clear.
You can't be contacting me today.

150
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,752
I'm scared, Wayne.

151
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:33,238
They've already started to question Beatriz
and I'm next. I don't know what to say.

152
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,918
- Where's your lawyer?
- He's not here yet.

153
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:43,315
OK, first of all, you're innocent.
Remember that, all right?

154
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:48,150
I'm not innocent. I let Sherry convince me
not to give Alan his medication.

155
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,357
- I could have saved his life.
- You don't know that.

156
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:57,954
What about Sherry?
Has she said anything to the president?

157
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:01,796
No. No. And she won't.
She told him it was an accident.

158
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:05,635
Now, whether he believes her or not
is another matter. I just...

159
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,078
- Wayne?
- Yeah?

160
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,925
Wayne?

161
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:14,953
Yeah, Bill. The president just walked in,
so I'll have to get back to you.

162
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:20,632
- I'm so scared.
- I understand. Just... remember what I said.

163
00:12:20,667 --> 00:12:23,120
<i>- Yeah.
- All right.</i>

164
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:28,753
- Well, what did Bill have to say?
- Uh, he found out that Alan died.

165
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,325
- That didn't take long.
- Yeah.

166
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,239
He wants us to know that we have his support
on the healthcare bill.

167
00:12:35,274 --> 00:12:36,951
That's good.

168
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,915
Have you spoken to Julia yet?

169
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,525
No.

170
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,030
Maybe you should call her.
Get her side of the story.

171
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,994
David, I think we should stay
as far away from this as possible.

172
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:55,325
You don't believe Sherry,
that it was an accident.

173
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,325
I don't know what to believe.
All I know is what it will look like.

174
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:04,230
You call in Sherry to deal with Milliken
and a few hours later he winds up dead.

175
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,790
<i> Let's go.</i>

176
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,725
Dad. Just heard back from Division.

177
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,513
They'll have a man on the inside.
His name is Jim Wong.

178
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:16,309
- Here's an update on your strike team.
- Thanks.

179
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,525
You OK?

180
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:21,394
Yeah, I'm OK. Did Chappelle question you
about shooting Nina?

181
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,398
Yeah.

182
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,879
And?

183
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,079
I told him I wasn't sorry Nina was dead,
or that I shot her.

184
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:32,911
She posed an immediate threat to you,
to me, and to thousands of innocent people.

185
00:13:32,946 --> 00:13:34,869
You had to do it, didn't you?

186
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,269
Yeah.

187
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,151
Come here.

188
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,916
- We gotta go.
- OK.

189
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,676
Wayne.

190
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,953
- What's going on?
- You tell me.

191
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:24,355
- Look, it's late and I'm a little too tired for...
- Sherry, I know about Alan Milliken.

192
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,915
Yes. It's awful.

193
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,153
But I already told David what happened.

194
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:37,270
Except you left out the part about preventing
Julia from giving Alan his medication.

195
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,790
You stood there and you watched a man die.

196
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:53,520
- You would've done the same thing.
- I never would've been there in the first place!

197
00:14:53,555 --> 00:14:57,720
David asked me to help clean up your mess.
What did you think he expected me to do?

198
00:14:57,755 --> 00:15:01,315
What he expected was for you
to get Alan off his back, but not like this.

199
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:04,756
Complex problems sometimes
have the simplest solutions.

200
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:05,909
For God's sakes.

201
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:09,351
You're upset. That's understandable.
But what is done is done.

202
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,950
This is insane, Sherry. You are insane.

203
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,954
We can control the situation, Wayne.
We just need to be on the same page.

204
00:15:15,989 --> 00:15:19,076
- I'm sorry, but David will have to handle this.
- David can't know.

205
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:23,520
For his own protection. If he doesn't
know anything, he's got nothing to deny.

206
00:15:23,555 --> 00:15:27,832
- Sherry, we can't cover this thing up.
- We can and we will.

207
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:33,436
That's why you're talking to me not David,
because you understand what has to happen.

208
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,553
Yeah, you've got it all figured out, don't you?

209
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,676
Wayne.

210
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,118
What did you say to Julia?

211
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:47,910
Not to talk to anyone
until she spoke to a lawyer.

212
00:15:47,945 --> 00:15:49,431
Good.

213
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:54,710
And, as long as she keeps her mouth shut,
we'll be fine.

214
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,999
Mrs Milliken?

215
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,110
I'm Detective Norris.

216
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,710
I'm sorry for your loss.

217
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,269
Thank you.

218
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:23,475
I know this is a... difficult time for you,

219
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:26,670
but I'd like to ask you a few questions.

220
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,474
Unless that's a problem.

221
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:35,000
No, no. It's just that my lawyer wanted me
to wait for him before I talked to anyone.

222
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:36,796
Really?

223
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,150
Did he say why?

224
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:43,045
- You know lawyers.
- Unfortunately, I do.

225
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:47,835
But these questions don't require counsel,
they're pretty straightforward.

226
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:52,874
According to the officers, you told them you
were asleep when the body was discovered.

227
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,349
Yes.

228
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,798
Alan and I have had
separate bedrooms since the stroke.

229
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:03,031
You didn't hear anything
until the housekeeper woke you?

230
00:17:03,066 --> 00:17:04,996
That's right.

231
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:12,149
Because, you see, she says she heard a car
starting up and leaving the driveway.

232
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,278
- Our driveway?
- That's what woke her up.

233
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:19,792
She got to the window in time to see
a light-colored car driving away.

234
00:17:19,827 --> 00:17:22,558
She thought it was a Mercedes.

235
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:26,275
I didn't hear anything so I... I wouldn't know.

236
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:31,632
Do you have any friends
who drive a light-colored Mercedes?

237
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:37,277
Detective, half of the people we know own
a Mercedes. And we know a lot of people.

238
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:42,037
Are you aware that the security cameras
in your surveillance system are shut down?

239
00:17:42,072 --> 00:17:44,155
According to the time code,

240
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:48,671
it appears they were shut down
about an hour before your husband's death.

241
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:53,710
Beatriz arms the system before she goes
to sleep. So maybe you should ask her.

242
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,917
My partner did.
She doesn't know anything about it.

243
00:17:56,952 --> 00:17:59,030
Neither do I.

244
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,553
- Are you sure about that?
- Yes.

245
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,675
You don't sound very sure.

246
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:12,445
Detective Norris,
exactly what are you implying here?

247
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:17,508
My husband was a very sick man.
He died because he was sick.

248
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,845
That's... probably true.

249
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:25,749
But it's beginning to look
like he might have had some help.

250
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,988
I'm sending grid coordinates,
so open a data pipe.

251
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,990
- Tony. How close are you?
- A few minutes.

252
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:43,636
Whoever accessed the account was within
this grid. We'll guide the field units as we go.

253
00:18:43,671 --> 00:18:45,356
- Did you get the coordinates?
- Yeah.

254
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:48,120
You're too far north, adjust toward Broadway.

255
00:18:48,155 --> 00:18:50,793
OK. Go right on College.

256
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,593
I won't have an address for a few minutes.
I'll call.

257
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,876
All right.

258
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:04,756
Look, I appreciate
what you said to Chappelle earlier.

259
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,285
- Wouldn't have said it if I didn't mean it.
- Still...

260
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:13,031
Finding the virus is all that matters right now.
Everything else can wait.

261
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:21,152
Are you going to wait
to tell Kim about your daughter?

262
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:26,515
- No. We talked about it.
- How'd she take it?

263
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,715
- She's handling it fine.
- Handling it fine?

264
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:32,595
It's between Kim and me.
If you don't mind, I'd like to keep it that way.

265
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,271
- Yes, I mind. She's my daughter.
- She's a grown woman.

266
00:19:36,306 --> 00:19:38,509
We care about each other.

267
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,749
We should stay focused
on what we're going to do.

268
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,885
<i>-  Where are you?
- I'm here.</i>

269
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,912
<i>- How long will it take?
- About 25 minutes.</i>

270
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,285
<i>- Hurry.
- I will.</i>

271
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:40,790
<i>- Get it done so we can get our money.
- It's gotta be done right.</i>

272
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:46,233
I don't want to be in any of the body bags
they'll be carrying out of here.

273
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,913
<i>- Hello?
-  Is this Sherry Palmer?</i>

274
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,845
Yes. Uh, who is this?

275
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:13,238
I'm Detective Michael Norris of the LAPD.
I'm sorry to bother you at this time of night.

276
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:17,395
Uh, Detective Norris, uh...
how did you get this number?

277
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:21,234
It was given to me
by a woman named Julia Milliken.

278
00:21:21,269 --> 00:21:24,117
- Do you know her?
- Yes, I-I do.

279
00:21:24,152 --> 00:21:26,674
Were you with her tonight?

280
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:31,845
- Tonight? No, I wasn't.
- She says you were.

281
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:36,032
- Well, she's lying. I've been here all night.
- And where's "here"?

282
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:40,639
"Here"'s in the District Offices
with my ex-husband, President Palmer.

283
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,245
He asked for my help on
a political matter and...

284
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:48,229
I'm sorry, Detective,
do you mind telling me what this is about?

285
00:21:48,264 --> 00:21:50,958
Mrs Milliken's husband died
about an hour and a half ago.

286
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,071
Oh, I'm so sorry.

287
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:58,190
<i>She claims that you and she caused his death
by withholding his medication.</i>

288
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:03,229
Well, that's preposterous. I haven't seen
Mr Milliken or his wife in over three years.

289
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:07,870
And you say that you were with
the president since... what time?

290
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:11,714
Since about ten o'clock.
That's over five hours ago.

291
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:16,392
And if we were to contact President Palmer,
he'd be able to confirm that?

292
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,836
I'm sure he will.

293
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:23,270
Thank you, Mrs Palmer. We'll be in touch.

294
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,074
Wayne?

295
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:37,355
Outbreak scenarios from
the National Health Services.

296
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,045
A little light reading.

297
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:42,197
They're sending a liaison
to answer any questions you may have.

298
00:22:42,232 --> 00:22:44,674
No doubt I'll have many.

299
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,389
Anything else?

300
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,959
No.

301
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,677
Wayne.

302
00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:01,671
I'm your brother. I think I know
when there's something on your mind.

303
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,997
No. I just want to make sure you're OK.

304
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,958
I'll let you know when this is all over.

305
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:15,148
- David?
- Yeah?

306
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:19,753
The reason I joined your administration
was because I thought I'd be an asset.

307
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:22,880
The last thing I ever wanted
was to be a thorn in your side.

308
00:23:22,915 --> 00:23:24,552
You are an asset.

309
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,910
There's a lot of smart people
you could've hired.

310
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:30,038
But none that I trust as much as you.

311
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,285
Wayne Palmer.

312
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:41,996
<i>It's Tony. We have a lead. Jack is on his way
with the team. I'll have someone update...</i>

313
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:46,432
I want you to stay on the line with me. I want
to be apprised of everything as it happens.

314
00:23:46,467 --> 00:23:51,030
CTU may have located the virus.
Jack Bauer's leading the operation.

315
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:09,038
- What about this area?
- Lieutenant Wong's heading that way now.

316
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,285
- Jack.
- Bill.

317
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,029
This is my partner, Chase Edmunds.
Have you got a man on the inside?

318
00:24:14,064 --> 00:24:15,990
He's been through about half the rooms.

319
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,311
- Have you seen Alvers or Amador?
- Not yet.

320
00:24:18,346 --> 00:24:20,076
<i> Captain, north room is clear.</i>

321
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,675
Moving down the main corridor.

322
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:47,485
I count 15 people.
I'm still not seeing either target.

323
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:53,152
Copy. There are three rooms
adjacent to the hall. They may be offices.

324
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,432
I'm checking it now.

325
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:06,189
Captain, I got an armed man outside
the door of the southernmost room.

326
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,476
<i> Don't move.</i>

327
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,478
He was looking in your room.

328
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,312
Lieutenant?

329
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,395
- Lieutenant Wong?
- Get your men in there now.

330
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:30,752
<i> Team A, move on target.
Team B, maintain perimeter.</i>

331
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,276
Get out of here.

332
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,117
Get down on the floor!

333
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,485
<i> You're not going anywhere.</i>

334
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:59,273
<i> Let me see your hands.</i>

335
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:11,151
Target's been neutralized.
All units sweep the building.

336
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:15,120
- Where's the virus, you son of a bitch?
- You're too late, Jack.

337
00:26:15,155 --> 00:26:16,872
Chase!

338
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,395
Take him into another room.
We got work to do.

339
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:24,229
I don't want to be disturbed
by the SWAT guys.

340
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,276
Set him down there.

341
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,285
You betrayed me, Jack.
You were with CTU all along.

342
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:56,313
That's right, Amador. You betrayed me too.
I'm just better at it than you.

343
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,715
It won't matter in the long run.
You have no idea what you're up against.

344
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,393
Why don't you tell me?

345
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,757
He knows who you are, Jack.

346
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:11,108
What are you talking about?
Who knows who I am?

347
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:15,229
"Don't presume to tell me about Jack Bauer."
That's what he said.

348
00:27:15,264 --> 00:27:18,715
You go up against him, you're a dead man.

349
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,595
All I want to know right now
is where the virus is.

350
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:25,285
I don't know. I've passed it off.

351
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:30,269
Look, you can do what you want to me.
I'm not going to tell you anything.

352
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,754
What are you afraid of?

353
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,912
Who are you afraid of?

354
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,085
We can protect you.

355
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,078
- Can you, Jack?
- Yes.

356
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:51,032
- And my family?
- Yes.

357
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:54,712
You couldn't even protect your own.

358
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:02,276
I'm going to ask you this one last time.

359
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,710
Where is the virus?

360
00:28:07,745 --> 00:28:09,276
Go to hell.

361
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,075
Chase.

362
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,315
Where's the virus?

363
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:28,912
When he comes to, you do it again.

364
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,872
- This is Bauer.
- Jack, I'm transferring you to Tony.

365
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,951
I'll take it over here.

366
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:44,597
Jack, I'll put you on speaker. Ryan's with me.

367
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,925
- We've got Amador.
- What about the virus?

368
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,599
- We were late. He'd already passed it on.
- To who?

369
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:53,157
We haven't found out.
Amador's terrified and doesn't scare easily.

370
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:58,190
He did tell me one thing. Whoever's
behind this apparently knows me very well.

371
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:01,925
- That's not much to go on, even if it's true.
- Yeah, but we also can't ignore it.

372
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:06,511
<i>Crosscheck everybody I've worked with over
the last five years on both sides of the law.</i>

373
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,360
Check the names against
what we know about the virus.

374
00:29:10,395 --> 00:29:11,839
<i>-  We're on it.
- Bauer?</i>

375
00:29:11,874 --> 00:29:13,516
Yeah?

376
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,515
We found an incubator.
There's no contamination,

377
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:21,075
but we'll isolate it, run a few tests
and then send it back to NHS.

378
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:24,277
We found prints, hairs.
We'll send them to your lab for a workup.

379
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,525
- OK. Good work.
- Jack, what's going on?

380
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:30,872
They found the incubator. They'll run
some tests here, then send it over to NHS.

381
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,794
The other evidence is coming back to our lab.

382
00:29:33,829 --> 00:29:35,525
- Agent Bauer?
- Yeah?

383
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:38,393
- We found Amador's laptop.
- Tony, hold on one second.

384
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:42,519
- Most of the files are heavily encrypted.
- Can you read any of it?

385
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:45,115
- Chandler Plaza Hotel.
- What about it?

386
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:50,280
His hard drive has the full architectural
schematic. Structural, plumbing, electrical.

387
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,925
When's the last time this file was accessed?

388
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,270
- Five hours ago.
- Tony, we've got a high-probability target.

389
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,925
<i>- What?
- The Chandler Plaza Hotel on Wilshire.</i>

390
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,430
Get me head of security at
Chandler Plaza Hotel. Should we evacuate?

391
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:06,269
<i>We don't know if it's been released.
Evacuation could accelerate an outbreak.</i>

392
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:09,957
We need to contain the building
without starting a panic.

393
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:14,911
I'll set up a soft perimeter, no police presence.
We'll send a team, run the operation on-site.

394
00:30:14,946 --> 00:30:17,996
No one goes in or out of that building.
Do you understand me?

395
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,639
- Copy that.
- Good.

396
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:24,633
Dennis, call NHS. Have them send teams
to the hotel as soon as possible.

397
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:27,125
They have to operate
under the radar, all right?

398
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:31,551
Tony, I have the head of security
for the Chandler Plaza Hotel, Craig Phillips.

399
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,349
Mr Phillips, this is Tony Almeida, CTU.

400
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:37,272
<i>- How can I help?
- There's a threat against your hotel.</i>

401
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:41,433
<i>As of now, it's important that you not allow
anybody in or out the structure.</i>

402
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:44,279
I understand. What's the nature of the threat?

403
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:48,725
The release of an infectious substance
inside the hotel.

404
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:54,756
<i>- The substance has already been released?
- It's possible. We don't know for sure.</i>

405
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:58,309
- Who's responsible?
- You're probably looking for a Marcus Alvers.

406
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:03,858
His description's being sent to you.
I want your people to do a search of the hotel.

407
00:31:03,893 --> 00:31:08,757
- Does that mean he's already in the hotel?
- We have to assume that's the case, yes.

408
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:13,676
<i>- All right, I'll start a search.
- I'm bringing a CTU team. We'll call you.</i>

409
00:31:13,711 --> 00:31:15,954
<i>- Right.
- Thanks.</i>

410
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,116
What the hell is this?

411
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:27,197
Ryan assigned me to head the team
that's going to the hotel.

412
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:29,151
- Ryan...
- I don't want to hear it.

413
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:33,712
As the head of CTU you're obliged to stay
here at the center of information flow.

414
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:37,594
Michelle has more hours of
disaster control simulation than anyone else,

415
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:41,953
not to mention her practical experience
from the DC anthrax outbreak.

416
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:46,199
Michelle will lead. Gael will second.
You'll be in constant communication.

417
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:50,911
Pass on any guidance you can
based on intel that comes in.

418
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,469
They're waiting for me.

419
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,516
Michelle.

420
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:04,233
I don't care what Ryan says. I can get
somebody from Division to take your place.

421
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,749
No, he's right.

422
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:09,513
I should be the one to go.

423
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:16,956
All right, then, you let me know
the second you get your people set. All right?

424
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,832
We're a couple of minutes away
from the hotel. Where's NHS?

425
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,669
Getting ready. They'll be there in a while.

426
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,399
What does that mean?
Two minutes? Ten minutes?

427
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:54,150
- Probably closer to 20.
- We don't have that kind of time, Tony.

428
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:59,992
I understand, but you wait till they get there. I
don't want anyone going in without biosuits.

429
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:03,511
We can't wait too long.
If we have to go in and stop the virus...

430
00:33:03,546 --> 00:33:06,033
Michelle, you wait. All right? That's an order.

431
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,838
Fine. Anything else?

432
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,398
No.

433
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:21,631
- What's wrong?
- Just stuff between Tony and me.

434
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,679
Sorry.

435
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:30,239
Things haven't been right
since he got back from the hospital.

436
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:32,157
The last couple of months,

437
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:37,473
Tony and I have been working pretty
closely together, planning this operation.

438
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:43,518
It's been eating away at him
that he wasn't able to talk to you about it.

439
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,555
I just want this day to end.

440
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:56,030
- Did you lock the garden doors?
- Yes, sir.

441
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:10,996
Mr Phillips? CTU has arrived.
They're outside the front door.

442
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:14,311
A maintenance man walked through.
I haven't seen him before.

443
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:18,150
- Turnover's pretty high in Engineering.
- Check it out anyway.

444
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,525
Yeah, sure thing.

445
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:22,120
<i>Oh.</i>

446
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,125
Phillips.

447
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:26,709
<i>Mr Phillips, this is
Agent Michelle Dessler from CTU.</i>

448
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,725
Have you circulated the Alvers photo yet?

449
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,594
<i>So far nobody has seen him. We're halfway
through the common areas of the hotel.</i>

450
00:34:33,629 --> 00:34:35,476
After that, start on the guest rooms.

451
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,911
<i>That'll take us some time
unless you can lend us some manpower.</i>

452
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:43,273
We'll be coming in
as soon as the hazmat suits arrive.

453
00:34:43,308 --> 00:34:45,793
<i>My people don't have any hazmat suits.</i>

454
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:52,072
I know that, Mr Phillips.
We'll bring some when we come in.

455
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:58,037
Yeah.

456
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,125
Michelle.

457
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:06,312
- I pulled this off the security camera.
- Alvers. How long ago was this?

458
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:09,432
- About half an hour ago.
- Has he come back out?

459
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:13,191
- Not as far as I can tell.
- Half an hour.

460
00:35:13,226 --> 00:35:15,269
He may have already released the virus.

461
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:19,319
But if he hasn't, we may be able to stop him.

462
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:26,152
I can't order anyone in
because it's against protocol,

463
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:31,473
but Alvers is in there
and we might still have a chance to stop him.

464
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,925
- Did you find that man?
- No.

465
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:49,589
But Penzo saw someone heading
to the utility room. He's gonna check.

466
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,878
Where can we set up?

467
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:08,954
Use this area and this area here. I thought
you were gonna wait for those hazmat suits.

468
00:36:08,989 --> 00:36:11,638
They'll let us know as soon as they get here.

469
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,960
This guy, we have an idea where he is.
Let me take you.

470
00:36:15,995 --> 00:36:19,316
Why don't you tell me and I'll check it out.

471
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:18,278
- Hands in the air! I'm a federal agent!
- Lady! Lady, take it easy.

472
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:20,510
Slowly!

473
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:25,509
- Move where I can see you!
- I'm a maintenance man, for God's sake.

474
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:29,109
I adjusted the thermostat
in the laundry room.

475
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,549
Stop right there!

476
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:40,393
Put your hands on your head!

477
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,030
Put your hands on your head!

478
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:51,432
Wrap your right arm around the pipe.

479
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,516
Now cuff yourself.

480
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,951
Where's the virus?

481
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:07,197
If this virus gets out, you die,
just like everyone else.

482
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:15,397
It's in the central ventilation unit.

483
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:21,325
<i>- Gael, can you hear me?
- I hear you.</i>

484
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:26,354
- The virus is in the central ventilation unit.
- I'm on my way.

485
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:07,711
- Found it. It's in a vial.
- Stay clear, Gael.

486
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:11,152
<i>NHS should be here any minute.
I'll send down a hazmat suit.</i>

487
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:15,676
There may not be enough time for that.
The vial's inside a detonating device.

488
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:20,112
<i>The timer's armed.
I've got to get to it, try to disarm it.</i>
