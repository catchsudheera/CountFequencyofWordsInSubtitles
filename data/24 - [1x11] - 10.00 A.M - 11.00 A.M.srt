1
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:18,212
Right now, terrorists are plotting
to assassinate a presidential candidate.

2
00:00:18,293 --> 00:00:21,365
My wife and daughter have been kidnapped.

3
00:00:21,453 --> 00:00:24,684
And people that I work with
may be involved in both.

4
00:00:25,253 --> 00:00:31,044
I'm Federal Agent Jack Bauer.
This is the longest day of my life.

5
00:00:34,053 --> 00:00:38,205
Our son is accused of murder.
The story's too big to hide.

6
00:00:38,293 --> 00:00:41,842
We need to control
when and how this story comes out.

7
00:00:41,933 --> 00:00:46,211
- I'm already taking care of the evidence.
- Taking care of it? How?

8
00:00:46,293 --> 00:00:48,170
That's all you really need to know.

9
00:00:49,453 --> 00:00:50,442
Mr. Drazen.

10
00:00:50,533 --> 00:00:54,765
I'd like to know why the David
Palmer situation hasn't been taken care of.

11
00:00:54,853 --> 00:00:57,048
My brother and I are very disappointed.

12
00:00:58,373 --> 00:01:00,523
- CTU. Myers.
- Hey, it's me.

13
00:01:00,613 --> 00:01:04,925
The police have thrown a net over this area.
I can't help Teri until I get through it.

14
00:01:05,013 --> 00:01:07,607
They're bringing in
Alberta Green to run things.

15
00:01:09,093 --> 00:01:11,482
- Hello, Nina.
- Hello, Alberta.

16
00:01:11,853 --> 00:01:15,368
- I'll put you through to Jack.
- Hey, sweetheart. You OK?

17
00:01:15,693 --> 00:01:19,208
Yeah. Who are these guys?
Why are they doing this?

18
00:01:19,293 --> 00:01:21,523
I don't know but I'm gonna find out.

19
00:01:21,613 --> 00:01:25,003
I just wanna make sure that you
and Mommy get home safely, OK?

20
00:01:25,613 --> 00:01:29,288
It's Tony. I've found something on
Jamey's computer. It might be a lead.

21
00:01:29,373 --> 00:01:31,887
- What?
- It's a name. Ted Cofell.

22
00:01:32,613 --> 00:01:35,081
- Have a nice day, . Cofell.
- You, too.

23
00:02:04,533 --> 00:02:09,004
Secret Service thinks the photographer may
have been in on the assassination attempt.

24
00:02:09,093 --> 00:02:11,732
He hasn't been seen since the breakfast.

25
00:02:11,813 --> 00:02:16,887
He was using the name Martin Belkin. Follow
up and report back to me in 30 minutes.

26
00:02:16,973 --> 00:02:20,204
I promised Division
a threat assessment on Palmer by noon.

27
00:02:20,293 --> 00:02:23,569
Check with Secret Service.
I don't want any overlap.

28
00:02:26,733 --> 00:02:29,201
- Still no sign of Jack?
- Nothing.

29
00:03:03,013 --> 00:03:06,528
- Cofell here.
- It's Kevin. Meet me at the Nordoffgarage.

30
00:03:06,613 --> 00:03:08,763
I'm already on my way to the airport.

31
00:03:08,853 --> 00:03:12,323
- This can't wait. Meet me as soon as possible.
- All right.

32
00:03:16,253 --> 00:03:21,088
Mark, change of plans. I'm gonna be meeting
someone in the parking garage on Nordoff.

33
00:03:28,493 --> 00:03:30,484
Did you hear me?

34
00:03:34,613 --> 00:03:36,604
Who are you?

35
00:03:38,213 --> 00:03:40,249
Where's Mark?

36
00:03:43,293 --> 00:03:45,648
What's going on here? Hm?

37
00:03:46,533 --> 00:03:48,524
Stop the car.

38
00:03:49,733 --> 00:03:51,724
Stop the car!

39
00:04:09,933 --> 00:04:13,084
Give me the phone through the divider. Easy.

40
00:04:13,173 --> 00:04:14,652
Now!

41
00:04:23,693 --> 00:04:26,412
Get up against the door
and sit on your hands.

42
00:04:27,213 --> 00:04:29,602
Who are you? What do you want? Money?

43
00:04:29,693 --> 00:04:33,163
I don't have much with me,
but I'm sure I could find some.

44
00:04:33,253 --> 00:04:35,050
Shut up.

45
00:04:35,133 --> 00:04:38,682
I'm Jack Bauer. Since midnight
my wife and daughter have been missing.

46
00:04:38,773 --> 00:04:43,210
I have reason to believe they're being held by
a colleague of yours, a man named Gaines.

47
00:04:43,293 --> 00:04:45,284
Where are they?

48
00:04:46,213 --> 00:04:50,684
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Where's my wife and daughter?!

49
00:04:51,373 --> 00:04:53,329
I'm just a businessman.

50
00:04:53,413 --> 00:04:57,406
An ordinary businessman,
riding around in a bulletproof limousine?

51
00:04:57,493 --> 00:04:59,643
- Yes, for protection.
- From what?

52
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:01,530
People like you.

53
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:12,131
This is your last chance.

54
00:05:12,213 --> 00:05:14,329
Where is my family?

55
00:05:17,053 --> 00:05:20,648
I swear to you, I don't know
what you're talking about.

56
00:05:27,213 --> 00:05:29,886
You're a very good liar.

57
00:05:32,093 --> 00:05:34,084
But I've seen better.

58
00:05:35,773 --> 00:05:37,764
You stay put.

59
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:14,766
CTU. Myers.

60
00:06:14,853 --> 00:06:18,687
- Hey, it's me. Can you talk?
- Let me open a secure line.

61
00:06:23,373 --> 00:06:26,046
- OK. We're clear.
- Has Teri called back yet?

62
00:06:26,133 --> 00:06:28,886
- No.
- What's Green doing?

63
00:06:28,973 --> 00:06:32,283
- Making herself at home in your office.
- She talked to you yet?

64
00:06:32,373 --> 00:06:33,886
Yes.

65
00:06:33,973 --> 00:06:38,489
I told her I severed all ties with you. From
now on, I play on the side of the angels.

66
00:06:38,573 --> 00:06:40,723
- She buy any of it?
- Not a word.

67
00:06:40,813 --> 00:06:43,043
- I've got Cofell.
- What do you mean "got"?

68
00:06:43,133 --> 00:06:46,523
- I've got him in his limousine.
- Has he told you anything?

69
00:06:46,613 --> 00:06:49,685
- I'm working on it.
- In other words, you've kidnapped him.

70
00:06:49,773 --> 00:06:52,128
He's the only link to Teri and Kim I've got.

71
00:06:52,213 --> 00:06:54,602
You don't even know
if he’s the right Ted Cofell.

72
00:06:54,693 --> 00:06:57,161
Every time we talk
you go further out on a limb.

73
00:06:57,253 --> 00:07:01,212
From the second they were taken,
tell me what I could have done differently.

74
00:07:01,293 --> 00:07:06,083
I don't know. I guess you're right. But I don't
know how much longer I can cover for you.

75
00:07:06,173 --> 00:07:10,610
Nina, please. Just focus and stay calm.
I need you right now.

76
00:07:10,693 --> 00:07:13,366
Cofell won't be easy to break.
I need your help.

77
00:07:13,453 --> 00:07:16,331
You want an interrogation profile
in what, 15 minutes?

78
00:07:16,413 --> 00:07:18,802
I'll give you about five.

79
00:07:18,893 --> 00:07:23,842
Nina, if I can't break Cofell, I won't be able
to find my family. Do you understand?

80
00:07:23,933 --> 00:07:26,845
- I'll do what I can.
- Thank you.

81
00:07:26,933 --> 00:07:32,007
I'm gonna look for a place to lay low for
a while. I'll get back to you as soon as I can.

82
00:07:59,013 --> 00:08:03,404
Your father will find us. If he doesn't,
the people that work for him will.

83
00:08:04,133 --> 00:08:06,522
How? They don't know where we are.

84
00:08:06,613 --> 00:08:09,081
They were tracing the call, Kim.

85
00:08:10,373 --> 00:08:13,092
Did they find our location
before the battery died?

86
00:08:13,173 --> 00:08:15,641
Well, we have to hope that they did.

87
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:22,088
Sorry about the phone.

88
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:31,489
- Thank you for helping. We hoped...
- I don't wanna know anything.

89
00:08:31,573 --> 00:08:36,363
- Trust me, it's better if I don't know anything.
- What do you mean?

90
00:08:36,453 --> 00:08:39,047
Eli sent me in here to get
information from you.

91
00:08:39,133 --> 00:08:42,125
But can't tell him what
I don't know, right? So...

92
00:08:43,573 --> 00:08:46,212
Whatever's goin' on, don't tell me about it.

93
00:08:47,573 --> 00:08:49,962
What's he gonna do to you?

94
00:08:50,453 --> 00:08:51,932
Rick.

95
00:09:07,533 --> 00:09:11,367
- What'd they say?
- I told you, they don't trust me.

96
00:09:11,453 --> 00:09:14,763
I saw the way that chick looks at you.
She must have said somethin'.

97
00:09:14,853 --> 00:09:16,844
Who was that guy I talked to? Her father?

98
00:09:16,933 --> 00:09:19,003
- They wouldn't say.
- You're lying!

99
00:09:22,093 --> 00:09:24,163
Stop it.

100
00:09:24,853 --> 00:09:27,083
Leave him alone!

101
00:09:53,213 --> 00:09:57,764
I was reviewing the report on the passenger
list. There was an anomaly in first class?

102
00:09:57,853 --> 00:10:02,369
The manifest made it look like there was an
empty seat, but we don't think there was one.

103
00:10:02,453 --> 00:10:06,765
- Who was actually in the seat?
- The photographer, Martin Belkin.

104
00:10:06,853 --> 00:10:09,083
The real photographer died in the explosion.

105
00:10:09,173 --> 00:10:13,724
And the assassin was at the breakfast.
He was enough of a lookalike to fool security,

106
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:17,408
and according to Secret Service
he had a legitimate ID, not a forgery.

107
00:10:17,493 --> 00:10:19,643
- How'd he get it?
- Still working on that.

108
00:10:25,373 --> 00:10:28,046
- Myers?
- Hey, it's me.

109
00:10:28,133 --> 00:10:30,522
Hi, Bill. Can you hang on a minute?

110
00:10:31,293 --> 00:10:34,603
It's Bill Warner at the bureau.
Shall I call him back?

111
00:10:34,693 --> 00:10:37,491
No. I need to speak to him.
Let me have the phone.

112
00:10:39,373 --> 00:10:43,252
Alberta? I got something
you should probably take a look at.

113
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:45,801
Tell Bill I'll call him later.

114
00:10:46,693 --> 00:10:50,971
The hitter's connection in Germany
may actually lead to the Balkans.

115
00:10:51,053 --> 00:10:53,362
Our sources indicate our guy's...

116
00:10:53,453 --> 00:10:55,762
- Hey. I'm here.
- Bad timing?

117
00:10:55,853 --> 00:10:58,686
No problem. I just could have used
a few more minutes.

118
00:10:58,773 --> 00:11:01,367
I wish I had 'em. Gimme what you got.

119
00:11:04,053 --> 00:11:08,729
All right. He's the oldest of three children.
His father died when he was a boy.

120
00:11:08,813 --> 00:11:11,202
Means he learned responsibility early.

121
00:11:11,293 --> 00:11:13,853
In college at 16. Intelligent.

122
00:11:13,933 --> 00:11:17,926
First in his class. Vice president
of a company three years later.

123
00:11:18,013 --> 00:11:21,244
OK. So he's ambitious, driven.
Maybe too much so.

124
00:11:22,373 --> 00:11:25,843
- He has a heart condition.
- I know. I've got his pills.

125
00:11:25,933 --> 00:11:27,730
He's very organised.

126
00:11:27,813 --> 00:11:30,885
No charities, no...

127
00:11:30,973 --> 00:11:35,888
He's not generous with time or money. Anal.
I'd guess passive-aggressive. Control freak.

128
00:11:35,973 --> 00:11:40,171
So make him sweat it out for a while,
assume control, then behave erratically.

129
00:11:40,253 --> 00:11:43,802
Yeah. One more thing.
Um, a hunch, really.

130
00:11:43,893 --> 00:11:48,762
With people this tightly wound, the threat
of pain can be more effective than pain itself.

131
00:11:48,853 --> 00:11:50,764
OK. I've got it.

132
00:11:50,853 --> 00:11:54,129
This is all just guesswork.
I could have done more if I'd had time.

133
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:57,091
You did great.
I'll get back to you as soon as I can.

134
00:11:57,173 --> 00:11:58,652
OK.

135
00:12:47,293 --> 00:12:49,443
Get over there. Now!

136
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:57,004
This doesn't have to take long. It's up to you.

137
00:12:59,053 --> 00:13:01,283
Do you know a man named Penticoff?

138
00:13:02,173 --> 00:13:04,971
How about Alan York? David Palmer?

139
00:13:05,053 --> 00:13:10,252
- Of course. He's running for president.
- The attempt on his life has failed.

140
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:13,609
The perpetrators will be in custody soon.
You're implicated.

141
00:13:13,693 --> 00:13:18,005
If you cooperate with me now,
I might be able to help you.

142
00:13:18,093 --> 00:13:21,449
I can only repeat, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

143
00:13:25,213 --> 00:13:28,523
- Your hands are sweating.
- Of course. I'm scared.

144
00:13:29,373 --> 00:13:31,489
Who were you meeting?

145
00:13:31,573 --> 00:13:34,883
- A man named Kevin Carroll.
- Who is he?

146
00:13:35,253 --> 00:13:38,484
He's a businessman, like myself.
He sells machine tools.

147
00:13:38,573 --> 00:13:42,805
- Why meet him in a parking garage?
- It was his choice. I don't know why.

148
00:13:43,693 --> 00:13:46,082
I told you everything I know.

149
00:13:53,773 --> 00:13:57,732
Hey, it's me. Run a background check
on a Kevin Carroll,

150
00:13:57,813 --> 00:14:00,088
allegedly a machine-tools salesman.

151
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:02,733
Probably an alias.

152
00:14:02,813 --> 00:14:04,292
Yeah.

153
00:14:09,653 --> 00:14:12,042
Let me show you something.

154
00:14:29,853 --> 00:14:33,050
- You ever hear about the Russian Gulag?
- What?

155
00:14:33,133 --> 00:14:35,601
A string of prisons in Northern Siberia.

156
00:14:36,533 --> 00:14:38,763
Russians didn't have hi-tech equipment,

157
00:14:38,853 --> 00:14:42,402
so they kinda had to make do
with what was around.

158
00:14:42,493 --> 00:14:44,848
Sort of like what I'm doin' right now.

159
00:14:46,693 --> 00:14:50,083
You probably don't think I could
force this towel down your throat.

160
00:14:50,173 --> 00:14:52,846
But trust me, I can. All the way.

161
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:55,891
Except I hold onto
this one little bit at the end.

162
00:14:55,973 --> 00:14:59,409
When your stomach starts to digest it...

163
00:14:59,893 --> 00:15:03,727
I pull it out,
taking your stomach lining with it.

164
00:15:04,533 --> 00:15:08,321
Most people, they take about
a week to die. It's very painful.

165
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:11,130
What kind of man are you?

166
00:15:11,213 --> 00:15:13,602
I don't want to hurt you.

167
00:15:14,853 --> 00:15:18,766
But I will do everything that
I have to do to protect my family.

168
00:15:21,373 --> 00:15:23,933
I wanna show you something.

169
00:15:24,013 --> 00:15:26,004
It's in my wallet.

170
00:15:34,693 --> 00:15:36,331
Open it. Please.

171
00:15:40,933 --> 00:15:43,242
I know you wanna see your family again.

172
00:15:44,293 --> 00:15:47,729
And I wanna see mine
more than anything in the world.

173
00:15:47,813 --> 00:15:50,486
Mr. Bauer, believe me,

174
00:15:50,573 --> 00:15:54,646
if I knew something that
would help you, I would tell you.

175
00:16:29,013 --> 00:16:30,571
- . Drazen.
- Found Bauer?

176
00:16:30,653 --> 00:16:34,646
No, but we're scanning
police frequencies, checking hospitals,

177
00:16:34,733 --> 00:16:37,531
and I'm expecting to hear from
our contact inside the CTU.

178
00:16:37,613 --> 00:16:42,368
- And if Bauer comes here as you suggested?
- We'll be ready for him.

179
00:16:43,133 --> 00:16:45,966
For an American operation
we thought we needed Americans.

180
00:16:46,053 --> 00:16:48,965
Perhaps we undervalued
our own capabilities.

181
00:16:52,213 --> 00:16:53,805
I'm pulling the plug on you.

182
00:16:53,893 --> 00:16:58,728
You were supposed to frame Bauer for the
assassination of Palmer, but he's still alive.

183
00:16:58,813 --> 00:17:01,008
- You don't know where Bauer is.
- No, but...

184
00:17:01,093 --> 00:17:02,924
You have failed.

185
00:17:06,053 --> 00:17:09,966
For over a year, you've been saying how
important this is. Now you're gonna quit?

186
00:17:10,053 --> 00:17:12,851
Quit? Of course not.

187
00:17:13,933 --> 00:17:17,892
We have a contingency plan. Bauer and
Palmer will be dead by the end of the day.

188
00:17:17,973 --> 00:17:21,682
You never said anything to me
about a contingency plan.

189
00:17:21,773 --> 00:17:24,241
It doesn't involve you.

190
00:17:27,453 --> 00:17:33,449
Just give me a little more time to find Bauer.
Till noon. It's not even two hours.

191
00:17:36,373 --> 00:17:38,364
I'll give you 30 minutes.

192
00:17:38,453 --> 00:17:41,650
If you don't find Bauer by then, I take over.

193
00:17:41,733 --> 00:17:46,363
Your last task will be to kill his wife
and daughter, and pull your people out.

194
00:18:03,133 --> 00:18:05,363
I like your education programme.

195
00:18:05,453 --> 00:18:09,332
But with all due respect,
I do have one or two suggestions.

196
00:18:09,413 --> 00:18:11,529
- That's why I'm here.
- David?

197
00:18:12,533 --> 00:18:16,242
I'm not one to say that teachers
shouldn't be accountable, but...

198
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:19,370
- Would you excuse me for just a moment?
- Sure.

199
00:18:27,293 --> 00:18:28,203
Carl.

200
00:18:28,293 --> 00:18:32,764
Hello, David. Since you fired me from
your staff, I assume this is a social call.

201
00:18:33,453 --> 00:18:36,206
I need to talk to you, in person.

202
00:18:36,293 --> 00:18:40,332
- Why's that?
- I got a very disturbing call today.

203
00:18:40,413 --> 00:18:42,005
Oh?

204
00:18:42,093 --> 00:18:44,971
I was told that George Ferragamo's
life may be in danger.

205
00:18:45,053 --> 00:18:47,362
Now, who told you that? Frank Ames?

206
00:18:47,453 --> 00:18:51,651
You know what an old lady he is.
Just don't pay any attention to him.

207
00:18:51,733 --> 00:18:53,883
I need to talk to you. Now.

208
00:18:53,973 --> 00:18:56,851
It's a pretty busy day for me, David.

209
00:18:56,933 --> 00:19:00,721
I know a few things about you, Carl.
Things you don't want spread around.

210
00:19:00,813 --> 00:19:05,728
Are you threatening me? Is that what
it's come to after all these years?

211
00:19:05,813 --> 00:19:09,283
It's come to whatever it takes
to get you over here now.

212
00:19:11,693 --> 00:19:15,049
- Where are you?
- Grant Elementary, in the valley.

213
00:19:16,773 --> 00:19:19,241
I'll be there by 11.

214
00:19:34,933 --> 00:19:36,810
- Nina Myers?
- Hey, it's me.

215
00:19:36,893 --> 00:19:41,364
- You got anything on Kevin Carroll yet?
- Yeah. I show six Kevin Carrolls.

216
00:19:41,453 --> 00:19:44,809
One does, in fact, work for
a machine-tool company.

217
00:19:44,893 --> 00:19:46,451
It's a cover. It's gotta be.

218
00:19:46,533 --> 00:19:49,525
There's another possibility -
you've got the wrong Cofell.

219
00:19:49,613 --> 00:19:52,764
No. He was implicated in Jamey's file,
along with Gaines.

220
00:19:52,853 --> 00:19:57,483
That file was partially erased. We can't
rely on it. I think you’re making a mistake.

221
00:19:57,573 --> 00:20:00,406
There's something about this guy.
This is not a mistake.

222
00:20:00,493 --> 00:20:05,806
Jack, I know you think he's all you’ve got,
but maybe that's affecting your judgment.

223
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:09,570
OK, thanks.

224
00:20:34,453 --> 00:20:37,286
We're going to see your friend Kevin Carroll.

225
00:20:57,053 --> 00:21:00,841
Looks like they're getting ready to leave.

226
00:21:00,933 --> 00:21:05,051
- Mom, what's wrong?
- It's nothing, honey. I'm all right.

227
00:21:05,133 --> 00:21:09,012
Would you stop saying that?
You're not all right. What did he do to you?

228
00:21:09,093 --> 00:21:13,086
Nothing, nothing. I've just...
I've been having this pain in my stomach.

229
00:21:13,173 --> 00:21:15,971
- How bad?
- It comes and goes.

230
00:21:16,613 --> 00:21:19,127
I can manage.

231
00:21:19,213 --> 00:21:21,363
- I should go tell somebody.
- No.

232
00:21:21,453 --> 00:21:24,013
- Mom, you need help.
- I said no.

233
00:21:27,533 --> 00:21:31,003
Your father is coming,
and until then we have to be strong.

234
00:21:35,173 --> 00:21:36,652
- OK.
- OK.

235
00:22:33,933 --> 00:22:35,969
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

236
00:22:36,053 --> 00:22:39,762
- How's the food?
- Oh, better than what we used to eat.

237
00:22:39,853 --> 00:22:45,086
- You went to the same elementary school?
- We've known each other all our lives.

238
00:22:45,173 --> 00:22:47,767
And still as much in love as ever.

239
00:22:48,773 --> 00:22:50,206
Thank you.

240
00:22:50,293 --> 00:22:55,162
I am due at another school, but it's been
wonderful meeting you and those great kids.

241
00:22:55,253 --> 00:22:57,608
- Thank you.
- Would you excuse us a second?

242
00:22:57,693 --> 00:22:59,684
Of course.

243
00:23:04,493 --> 00:23:07,929
I need to know if you've talked
to Carl since I fired him.

244
00:23:09,173 --> 00:23:12,051
- Yes, I have.
- What did you talk about?

245
00:23:12,733 --> 00:23:16,772
I asked him to find a way to stop Maureen
Kingsley from airing the story about Keith.

246
00:23:16,853 --> 00:23:18,844
He said he would.

247
00:23:19,613 --> 00:23:22,366
What did he say exactly?

248
00:23:22,453 --> 00:23:28,289
As near as I can remember, something about
taking care of the evidence against Keith.

249
00:23:34,773 --> 00:23:38,527
And you didn't think
that was worth mentioning to me?

250
00:23:39,613 --> 00:23:42,366
I wasn't sure what he meant, David.

251
00:23:44,573 --> 00:23:49,488
I'm trying to believe that when you deceived
me seven years ago it was a one-time thing.

252
00:23:53,813 --> 00:23:55,963
This isn't making it any easier.

253
00:23:57,493 --> 00:23:59,961
That is so unfair.

254
00:24:05,453 --> 00:24:07,444
See you later.

255
00:24:09,373 --> 00:24:13,810
You asked me to have someone check
on Jack Bauer, the guy at the breakfast.

256
00:24:13,893 --> 00:24:17,966
- Yes. What did you find?
- Typical agency file: lots of gaps, classified.

257
00:24:18,053 --> 00:24:21,363
Was one of those gaps
in the summer about two years ago?

258
00:24:22,453 --> 00:24:27,083
- How'd you know?
- Later. We've got other things to deal with.

259
00:24:38,613 --> 00:24:40,569
Move up to the other seat.

260
00:24:40,653 --> 00:24:42,132
Now!

261
00:25:17,973 --> 00:25:21,682
An average businessman
with a Microtech HALO in his car?

262
00:25:25,213 --> 00:25:27,932
What'd you just say? Say it again.

263
00:25:28,013 --> 00:25:30,573
Say it again! Or I'll break your other wrist!

264
00:25:35,293 --> 00:25:39,650
You speak Serbian? What, are you
from Belgrade? You got family there?

265
00:25:39,973 --> 00:25:42,692
You deserve everything
that's happening to you.

266
00:25:42,773 --> 00:25:45,003
What do you know about
what's happening to me?

267
00:25:45,093 --> 00:25:49,052
There's only one thing that
you need to know, Bauer. You will pay.

268
00:25:51,933 --> 00:25:54,606
- You will pay.
- Who are you?

269
00:25:55,013 --> 00:25:56,332
Who are you?!

270
00:26:07,533 --> 00:26:09,330
What's the matter?

271
00:26:09,413 --> 00:26:11,449
Is it your heart?

272
00:26:13,693 --> 00:26:18,892
I got your medicine here. All I want is a little
information. Where's my wife and daughter?

273
00:26:18,973 --> 00:26:23,603
Where is my family?! I'll give you
the medicine. Tell me where my family is!

274
00:26:32,453 --> 00:26:34,444
Take the medicine.

275
00:26:43,253 --> 00:26:45,608
No. No, no.

276
00:26:52,773 --> 00:26:54,570
No. No!

277
00:26:56,053 --> 00:26:59,250
Please. Please, my wife and family.

278
00:26:59,333 --> 00:27:02,803
Please. Please. Where is
my wife and daughter? Please!

279
00:27:03,173 --> 00:27:05,004
Don't die. Don't.

280
00:27:28,133 --> 00:27:30,283
Hey, listen to me, OK?

281
00:27:30,373 --> 00:27:34,252
It's not your fault. There's no way
you could have seen that coming.

282
00:27:34,333 --> 00:27:36,847
How am I gonna find Teri and Kim?

283
00:27:36,933 --> 00:27:40,448
The man he's meeting, Kevin Carroll,
maybe he knows something.

284
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:43,001
If he shows up - he's already late.

285
00:27:45,013 --> 00:27:49,803
There's something very wrong about this
situation. This is not just about David Palmer.

286
00:27:49,893 --> 00:27:52,043
This is personal. They're comin' after me.

287
00:27:52,133 --> 00:27:55,170
What's the connection between
you and Palmer? Or you and Cofell?

288
00:27:55,253 --> 00:27:57,721
I don't know!

289
00:28:04,613 --> 00:28:07,571
Look, this is what I want you to do.

290
00:28:07,653 --> 00:28:11,362
Dig deeper into Cofell's background.
Check out his extended family.

291
00:28:11,453 --> 00:28:14,729
- Access my field-assignment files.
- They're classified.

292
00:28:14,813 --> 00:28:16,804
I know. Find your way in.

293
00:28:16,893 --> 00:28:21,045
Check out an assignment I had two years
ago. I was in Belgrade, then Kosovo.

294
00:28:21,133 --> 00:28:23,203
It was called Operation Nightfall.

295
00:28:23,293 --> 00:28:27,764
Then crosscheck everything that you find out
from that with Cofell's file. Understand?

296
00:28:27,853 --> 00:28:30,413
- Yeah.
- OK. Do it now.

297
00:28:35,493 --> 00:28:39,042
Come on, Jack. Come on.
Pull yourself together.

298
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:44,044
Come on.

299
00:29:08,733 --> 00:29:10,052
Hey.

300
00:29:11,133 --> 00:29:13,966
- What's this?
- Nothing. Act like you're interested.

301
00:29:14,053 --> 00:29:16,965
Alberta probably thinks
we're helping Jack, right?

302
00:29:17,053 --> 00:29:18,805
She can't prove it.

303
00:29:18,893 --> 00:29:22,124
Why don't we just come clean,
tell her what's goin' on?

304
00:29:22,213 --> 00:29:24,329
Jack says no.

305
00:29:26,373 --> 00:29:31,128
Maybe you should stop thinking about
Jack and start thinking about yourself.

306
00:29:31,213 --> 00:29:34,125
It's Jack's family, so it's Jack's call.

307
00:29:34,613 --> 00:29:38,288
After what happened with Jamey,
we don't know who we can trust.

308
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:42,163
Come on. Green may be a hard-ass,
but I don't think she's dirty.

309
00:29:42,253 --> 00:29:44,562
I agree, but she does things by the book.

310
00:29:44,653 --> 00:29:49,852
If we tell her, she'll call Division, and before
you know it there'll be 30 people in the loop.

311
00:29:51,693 --> 00:29:54,161
If just one of them is another Jamey...

312
00:30:12,773 --> 00:30:14,092
Kim.

313
00:30:14,173 --> 00:30:17,848
Kim, honey. Wake up.
You can't fall asleep. Come on.

314
00:30:17,933 --> 00:30:18,922
Why?

315
00:30:19,013 --> 00:30:22,130
Because if Dad comes,
we might have to move quickly. Come on.

316
00:30:22,213 --> 00:30:24,443
- If we have to move, I'll move.
- Come on.

317
00:30:24,533 --> 00:30:27,684
- Mom, I'm tired.
- I know. And you've been very brave.

318
00:30:27,773 --> 00:30:32,767
You'll just have to stay that way a little
while longer. We can't miss our chance.

319
00:30:37,653 --> 00:30:39,644
Are you OK?

320
00:30:41,013 --> 00:30:43,322
Take it.

321
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:47,045
It's Dan's. He left it in the van.

322
00:30:47,133 --> 00:30:49,124
It's loaded.

323
00:30:51,853 --> 00:30:54,162
That's all I can do.

324
00:30:54,653 --> 00:30:57,121
And I'm sorry about gettin' you into this.

325
00:30:58,093 --> 00:31:00,891
Sorry about...

326
00:31:00,973 --> 00:31:03,009
Sorry about everything.

327
00:31:10,613 --> 00:31:14,572
What are we supposed to do?
Shoot our way out?

328
00:31:21,893 --> 00:31:24,726
They're gonna kill us. This time they mean it.

329
00:31:26,493 --> 00:31:28,131
Oh, God!

330
00:31:28,893 --> 00:31:31,123
No. No.

331
00:31:31,613 --> 00:31:33,365
Hey, hey, hey. Hey.

332
00:31:33,453 --> 00:31:36,604
Kimberly, listen to me.
We're alive. Come here.

333
00:31:39,133 --> 00:31:43,968
We're alive, and as long as we're alive,
I'm not giving up.

334
00:31:44,053 --> 00:31:46,567
And neither are you.

335
00:31:46,653 --> 00:31:48,450
Right?

336
00:31:50,373 --> 00:31:52,011
Right.

337
00:32:32,213 --> 00:32:34,249
I'm sorry I'm late.

338
00:32:34,333 --> 00:32:37,405
I had a couple of calls to make.

339
00:32:40,853 --> 00:32:43,128
Hello, Alan.

340
00:32:43,613 --> 00:32:46,286
Or is it Kevin?

341
00:32:48,773 --> 00:32:51,446
Where's my wife?

342
00:33:55,973 --> 00:33:57,691
Check this out.

343
00:34:06,573 --> 00:34:08,564
Wake up.

344
00:34:20,653 --> 00:34:22,883
- Where's my wife?
- She's safe.

345
00:34:22,973 --> 00:34:25,089
- And my daughter?
- Safe.

346
00:34:26,293 --> 00:34:28,284
- Where?
- Jack...

347
00:34:32,853 --> 00:34:35,845
Don't make this any harder than it has to be.

348
00:34:35,933 --> 00:34:40,449
- I was about to say the same thing to you.
- But I'm the man with the gun.

349
00:34:40,533 --> 00:34:43,445
If you kill me, how are you
gonna find your family?

350
00:34:43,533 --> 00:34:45,524
Who said anything about killing?

351
00:34:50,493 --> 00:34:53,849
I'm pretty good at withstanding pain.

352
00:34:53,933 --> 00:34:58,131
But if you don't get there soon,
it may be too late.

353
00:34:58,213 --> 00:35:01,842
Since you are no longer any use to us, Jack,

354
00:35:03,773 --> 00:35:07,209
there's no reason to keep your family alive.

355
00:35:07,293 --> 00:35:09,761
So we need to come to an agreement.

356
00:35:13,373 --> 00:35:15,170
I'm listening.

357
00:35:15,253 --> 00:35:18,563
You let me go, and I tell you where they are.

358
00:35:23,933 --> 00:35:28,927
As soon as I know they're safe...
I'll let you go.

359
00:35:29,013 --> 00:35:31,481
You've got my word on it.

360
00:35:31,573 --> 00:35:33,928
Your word? That works for me!

361
00:35:36,213 --> 00:35:40,764
We are talking about my family.
Do you understand me?

362
00:35:40,853 --> 00:35:46,849
All I want is to get them back. So as soon
as I know they are safe, I will let you go.

363
00:35:46,933 --> 00:35:49,367
That is the agreement.

364
00:35:51,733 --> 00:35:54,293
If I say no?

365
00:35:54,373 --> 00:35:58,571
We'll find out how good you really are
at withstanding some pain.

366
00:36:08,213 --> 00:36:10,204
Drive the car.

367
00:36:41,373 --> 00:36:43,250
Your half-hour's up.

368
00:36:44,133 --> 00:36:46,772
Kill Bauer's wife and daughter.

369
00:36:46,853 --> 00:36:49,321
Our contingency doesn't involve them.

370
00:36:56,533 --> 00:36:57,761
Eli.

371
00:37:06,213 --> 00:37:08,966
Tell the drivers to make
their final preparations.

372
00:37:12,053 --> 00:37:14,044
Then kill the women.

373
00:37:25,013 --> 00:37:30,531
I'm well aware that often these days you have
to be surrogate parents as well as teachers.

374
00:37:30,613 --> 00:37:34,003
What can be done about that
at the federal level?

375
00:37:36,453 --> 00:37:42,244
That's a good question, one Mike has
become an expert on. Haven't you, Mike?

376
00:37:42,333 --> 00:37:45,211
I'm in charge of preparing
our position paper on education,

377
00:37:45,293 --> 00:37:48,603
and I've reached some conclusions
I think you'll find interesting.

378
00:37:48,693 --> 00:37:52,208
- Wonderful.
- Studies have proven that...

379
00:38:02,213 --> 00:38:03,965
What's this about Ferragamo?

380
00:38:04,053 --> 00:38:06,521
What difference does it make,
if you're protected?

381
00:38:06,613 --> 00:38:10,447
What difference does it make?
That someone may be murdered?

382
00:38:10,533 --> 00:38:14,845
- I didn't say anything about murder.
- You didn't deny it either.

383
00:38:14,933 --> 00:38:17,811
OK, I deny it. Satisfied?

384
00:38:19,973 --> 00:38:25,047
David, power has a price,
and that price has to be paid. Always.

385
00:38:25,133 --> 00:38:27,203
Spare me the civics lesson.

386
00:38:27,293 --> 00:38:31,002
I will not permit anyone to be harmed
in any way in the name of my candidacy.

387
00:38:31,093 --> 00:38:36,451
You don't permit or not permit anything.
Don't you understand that by now?

388
00:38:38,413 --> 00:38:40,847
These are very serious people, David.

389
00:38:40,933 --> 00:38:45,882
They didn't put all this time and money
behind you to let things fall apart now.

390
00:38:45,973 --> 00:38:49,010
They'll find someone
to do what they need done.

391
00:38:49,973 --> 00:38:53,443
- I can't believe you used to work for me.
- I never worked for you.

392
00:38:53,533 --> 00:38:57,287
You and I have always worked for them.

393
00:39:03,293 --> 00:39:06,171
You, maybe.

394
00:39:06,253 --> 00:39:08,244
Not me.

395
00:39:17,573 --> 00:39:19,723
Information. How can I direct your call?

396
00:39:19,813 --> 00:39:23,123
Yes. Give me the number
on a Dr George Ferragamo.

397
00:39:23,213 --> 00:39:25,852
Just put me through immediately, please.

398
00:39:35,613 --> 00:39:38,127
Dad isn't coming, is he?

399
00:39:38,213 --> 00:39:40,010
I don't know, baby.

400
00:39:47,893 --> 00:39:51,886
So I guess your time's up.
Don't worry, I'll make it fast.

401
00:40:04,133 --> 00:40:05,885
No!

402
00:40:37,773 --> 00:40:41,163
Whoever knew he came in to kill us
was expecting two shots.

403
00:40:41,253 --> 00:40:43,721
That was the second shot.

404
00:40:44,773 --> 00:40:47,162
What do we do now?

405
00:40:48,693 --> 00:40:51,082
We hide the body.

406
00:41:07,453 --> 00:41:09,444
Turn left here.

407
00:41:18,773 --> 00:41:21,162
Where are we headed?

408
00:41:22,653 --> 00:41:25,042
Where are we headed?

409
00:41:25,893 --> 00:41:30,125
Just drive straight.
I'm taking you to your family.
