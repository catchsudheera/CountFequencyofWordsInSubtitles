1
00:02:33,317 --> 00:02:35,548
No!

2
00:02:35,638 --> 00:02:37,675
Keep moving.

3
00:02:50,245 --> 00:02:51,998
Shut up!

4
00:02:52,087 --> 00:02:54,079
Put her down. Put her down.

5
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:57,802
Keep movin'.

6
00:02:57,889 --> 00:03:00,644
Shut up! Let's go. Come on, keep goin'.

7
00:03:09,735 --> 00:03:11,727
- We have to go back.
- She's dead.

8
00:03:11,817 --> 00:03:13,648
- You don't know that.
- Get in!

9
00:03:13,738 --> 00:03:16,811
- Take it easy.
- You better decide whose side you're on!

10
00:03:16,899 --> 00:03:19,460
We can't just leave her
in the middle of the street.

11
00:03:22,142 --> 00:03:23,940
Nina...

12
00:03:31,747 --> 00:03:35,378
- Nina, I know you're upset.
- Of course I'm upset. What do you expect?

13
00:03:35,469 --> 00:03:40,591
Sorry. Look, the reason why I had to leave
the office is because I got a call from Walsh.

14
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:44,462
He was meeting one of our agents,
Scott Baylor. He said he had evidence...

15
00:03:44,553 --> 00:03:48,105
That led you to me, I know.
But you should have thought it through.

16
00:03:48,196 --> 00:03:51,588
Nina, listen to me. Richard Walsh is dead.

17
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:56,592
- What?
- He was shot. I watched him die.

18
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,232
What is going on?

19
00:04:00,322 --> 00:04:05,080
He was killed cos he had proof that people
within our agency are behind the Palmer hit.

20
00:04:05,164 --> 00:04:07,554
- Who?
- I don't know yet.

21
00:04:07,646 --> 00:04:10,366
Right before Richard died
he gave me that key card.

22
00:04:10,448 --> 00:04:14,158
I'm hoping that's going to tell us.
Jamey's trying to break it down now.

23
00:04:14,249 --> 00:04:18,085
- You trust Jamey?
- He did. I trust you.

24
00:04:18,171 --> 00:04:20,481
The three of us have to work together.

25
00:04:20,573 --> 00:04:24,807
From this point forward we have to
assume that we can trust nobody else.

26
00:04:26,096 --> 00:04:28,052
- I understand.
- Good.

27
00:04:29,497 --> 00:04:31,454
Are you all right?

28
00:04:31,538 --> 00:04:33,257
Yeah.

29
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:36,492
Work the card with Jamey.
I have to make a call.

30
00:04:45,505 --> 00:04:47,737
Agent Pierce wanted to talk to you.

31
00:04:47,826 --> 00:04:50,183
- Fine. Give me a minute.
- It's very important.

32
00:04:50,268 --> 00:04:52,260
A minute.

33
00:04:58,592 --> 00:05:00,185
- Yeah?
- Find anything out?

34
00:05:00,274 --> 00:05:02,629
It's barely been half an hour
since you told me.

35
00:05:02,715 --> 00:05:07,029
I need you to find out the source of this story.
Not first thing in the morning, now.

36
00:05:07,117 --> 00:05:10,997
This can't be done over the phone.
I have to talk to some people in person.

37
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:13,230
I wanna hear something by four.

38
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:16,234
You've gotta let me...

39
00:05:20,404 --> 00:05:22,396
- Where were you?
- I went for a drive.

40
00:05:22,485 --> 00:05:25,718
A drive? Alone, at this time of night?

41
00:05:25,807 --> 00:05:28,800
- I just needed to get away for a while.
- Away from what?

42
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:34,408
Everything.

43
00:05:35,451 --> 00:05:39,366
They haven't told you, have they?
There's been an assassination threat.

44
00:05:41,614 --> 00:05:44,449
- That's what all the fuss is about?
- Yes.

45
00:05:46,217 --> 00:05:49,609
I thought it was something serious.

46
00:05:57,743 --> 00:06:01,738
Jack. I'm screening the passenger list.
Something doesn't add up here.

47
00:06:01,825 --> 00:06:05,615
- What?
- 2B. Manifest shows an empty seat.

48
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:06,345
So?

49
00:06:06,428 --> 00:06:11,106
According to the ticketing file, first class
was full. Plus there was a waiting list.

50
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:14,229
Why would the plane take off
with an empty seat?

51
00:06:14,312 --> 00:06:16,668
This is good.
What time does Rayburn get in?

52
00:06:16,753 --> 00:06:19,428
- Six.
- Wake him up. Bring him in now.

53
00:06:19,514 --> 00:06:21,313
Jack.

54
00:06:26,038 --> 00:06:28,314
OK. We've got something off the key card.

55
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,633
The encryption is complex. I've asked
Jamey to isolate sectors. She's extracted one.

56
00:06:32,722 --> 00:06:34,201
Just part of one.

57
00:06:34,283 --> 00:06:37,674
That's it, just an address?
What's that got to do with Palmer?

58
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:40,917
- It doesn't say.
- Crosscheck it with his schedule.

59
00:06:41,006 --> 00:06:45,764
- He's not going anywhere near it.
- Has he been near it since he came here?

60
00:06:45,848 --> 00:06:46,644
No.

61
00:06:46,729 --> 00:06:49,768
How about previous visits?
Connection to family members?

62
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:51,524
I can check. It'll take time.

63
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:54,605
No. Let's see what
we can peel off. Start in here.

64
00:06:58,735 --> 00:07:00,852
Just the address on San Fernando Road.

65
00:07:00,936 --> 00:07:04,374
How long will it take you to access
the next level? Minutes or hours?

66
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:07,418
- Hours, most likely.
- We don't have hours.

67
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,890
I'll check out the address myself.

68
00:07:11,262 --> 00:07:13,857
- You want some backup?
- No. I need you here.

69
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:22,942
- What's wrong?
- I can't access our decryption software.

70
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:29,104
Phones are down, too.

71
00:07:29,192 --> 00:07:30,910
It's a lockdown.

72
00:07:36,354 --> 00:07:38,824
It's Mason. Hide the key card.

73
00:07:40,277 --> 00:07:42,269
I'll handle this.

74
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:57,523
Hello, Nina. These men are with Internal
Investigations. You are in official lockdown.

75
00:07:57,606 --> 00:08:00,075
- By what authority?
- District Office.

76
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:05,762
We're trying to stop an assassination. Can't
you find anything better to do than this?

77
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:10,404
Two agents died tonight. A lockdown's
standard procedure until we get answers.

78
00:08:11,493 --> 00:08:13,565
- Where's Jack?
- I don't know.

79
00:08:19,857 --> 00:08:22,247
Station two, coming your way.

80
00:08:33,945 --> 00:08:36,096
Lockdown. Nobody leaves.

81
00:08:36,186 --> 00:08:38,621
- Lockdown? Are you serious?
- No, I'm kidding.

82
00:08:38,707 --> 00:08:41,701
- I gotta get some work from the car.
- You know the drill.

83
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:43,587
Fine. You take the keys.

84
00:08:58,758 --> 00:09:02,354
All right. I assume you're all
familiar with lockdown procedures.

85
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:06,355
You remain in the building.
All communications will be monitored.

86
00:09:06,442 --> 00:09:10,198
Any incoming calls without
secure access codes will be blocked.

87
00:09:10,284 --> 00:09:15,565
In the meantime, continue to work on the
systems available until notified otherwise.

88
00:09:16,607 --> 00:09:19,168
Who called them in, Tony? You?

89
00:09:19,249 --> 00:09:21,081
Yeah, me.

90
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:24,881
- Why?
- Somebody had to. Jack's out of control.

91
00:09:24,972 --> 00:09:26,326
Meaning what?

92
00:09:26,412 --> 00:09:29,087
Two agents are down.
Jack was there when it happened.

93
00:09:29,173 --> 00:09:31,530
You can't believe he was involved in that.

94
00:09:31,615 --> 00:09:34,529
Tell you the truth,
I don't know what to believe.

95
00:09:35,737 --> 00:09:38,651
I'd hate to think this has
anything to do with me.

96
00:09:38,739 --> 00:09:42,734
- You think what you want.
- Could be here for quite a while.

97
00:09:43,782 --> 00:09:45,774
He got past me.

98
00:09:50,665 --> 00:09:52,782
All right, Nina, where'd he go?

99
00:09:52,866 --> 00:09:55,257
I already told you, I don't know.

100
00:09:56,868 --> 00:09:59,463
You let me know, we can
get things up and running.

101
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:02,349
I'm really sorry, George. I can't help you out.

102
00:10:02,431 --> 00:10:04,423
Mm-hm. Me, too.

103
00:10:20,841 --> 00:10:23,310
Senator, could I have a word with you?

104
00:10:31,246 --> 00:10:34,604
I'm not sure you appreciate
the seriousness of this threat.

105
00:10:34,688 --> 00:10:37,203
I get serious threats every morning.

106
00:10:37,289 --> 00:10:41,682
With all due respect, this one's different.
It's a pro from overseas.

107
00:10:42,492 --> 00:10:44,961
- Who's behind it?
- We don't know.

108
00:10:45,053 --> 00:10:50,176
But as I'm sure you're aware, an airliner
exploded an hour and a half ago outside LA.

109
00:10:50,256 --> 00:10:52,566
- No survivors.
- There's some connection?

110
00:10:52,657 --> 00:10:55,332
Again, we don't know. We're looking into it.

111
00:10:55,419 --> 00:10:57,058
What do we know?

112
00:10:57,139 --> 00:11:01,579
That these are serious people,
and they want you dead, today.

113
00:11:15,069 --> 00:11:17,868
- What about my family?
- The threat is against you only.

114
00:11:17,951 --> 00:11:21,342
But of course we'll increase
security for your family as well.

115
00:11:21,432 --> 00:11:23,902
The main thing is your schedule.

116
00:11:24,474 --> 00:11:27,387
Today's primary day.
I'm not gonna hide in my hotel room.

117
00:11:27,475 --> 00:11:31,152
Understood, but we recommend some
changes. The breakfast, for example.

118
00:11:31,238 --> 00:11:36,234
The breakfast is important. The top labour
leaders in the state are gonna be there.

119
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,312
We're trying to keep you alive.

120
00:11:38,402 --> 00:11:41,122
And I'm trying to win an election.

121
00:11:45,885 --> 00:11:47,683
Mom said you wanted to see me.

122
00:11:47,766 --> 00:11:50,486
Wanted to make sure you're all right.
Why are you up?

123
00:11:50,568 --> 00:11:53,561
If I'm not sleeping by three, I'm not sleeping.

124
00:11:53,649 --> 00:11:56,005
I was gonna watch some tube.
Wanna join me?

125
00:11:56,091 --> 00:11:59,129
- Anything on this time of night?
- Nothing good.

126
00:12:00,093 --> 00:12:02,085
I guess I'll pass.

127
00:12:05,095 --> 00:12:07,053
Heard about the threat.

128
00:12:07,136 --> 00:12:09,936
Don't worry about it.
They'll take good care of me.

129
00:12:11,059 --> 00:12:12,538
They better.

130
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:16,770
You better get some rest.

131
00:12:36,751 --> 00:12:39,473
I'm telling you, we have
to go back and get Janet.

132
00:12:39,553 --> 00:12:42,114
Are you gonna tell
your girlfriend to shut her mouth?

133
00:12:42,195 --> 00:12:46,474
- She's probably dead.
- What if she's not? She might need help.

134
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:54,038
Why do you always do what he tells you?
Why don't you think for yourself?

135
00:12:54,121 --> 00:12:57,752
- Just leave it alone, OK?
- I can't. She's my friend.

136
00:13:14,452 --> 00:13:17,843
You know, she may be right after all.

137
00:13:18,934 --> 00:13:22,724
We should go back.
If she's alive, she can ID us.

138
00:13:24,057 --> 00:13:27,688
- We have to shut her up for good.
- What?! What are you saying?

139
00:13:29,219 --> 00:13:32,736
You're gonna kill her?
You're gonna kill Janet, huh? Huh?

140
00:13:32,821 --> 00:13:35,018
Close her mouth. Now!

141
00:13:35,102 --> 00:13:37,822
I'm not gonna let you tie me up! No!

142
00:13:40,705 --> 00:13:43,267
Sounds like she's gonna tie you up.

143
00:13:55,633 --> 00:13:58,432
I just hope the girls are still there.

144
00:14:10,921 --> 00:14:11,956
Oh, no.

145
00:14:14,443 --> 00:14:16,195
I don't believe this.

146
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:36,887
Stay in your car, sir. Back in the car.

147
00:14:36,974 --> 00:14:39,444
Keep your hands where I can see 'em.

148
00:14:42,578 --> 00:14:46,572
- Do you know how fast you were drivin'?
- Yes. Our daughters are missing.

149
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:49,459
We got a phone call.
We're on our way to pick them up.

150
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:52,376
- Licence and registration.
- Did you hear what I said?

151
00:14:52,463 --> 00:14:55,422
Officer, my name is Teri Bauer.
He's telling the truth.

152
00:14:55,504 --> 00:14:59,784
We really could use your help. My daughter
just phoned from Platt's Auto Body.

153
00:14:59,867 --> 00:15:03,258
Different last names.
One's married, one's not.

154
00:15:03,348 --> 00:15:06,467
I just called 91115 minutes ago.
Verify it if you want.

155
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:10,340
- You know what? I'm gonna do that.
- Yeah. Why don't you do that?

156
00:15:19,837 --> 00:15:21,635
- Listen...
- I said remain in the car.

157
00:15:21,718 --> 00:15:25,474
I understand that. Can we speed things up?
Write us a ticket so we can go?

158
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:30,272
The woman asked me to verify the 911.
That's what I'm trying to do.

159
00:15:30,362 --> 00:15:34,152
You know, you are a real
piece of work. You know that?

160
00:15:36,285 --> 00:15:40,360
- My daughter is in trouble. We're finished.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Take it easy.

161
00:15:40,448 --> 00:15:43,726
- Relax, everyone. Whoa.
- Get your hands off me!

162
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:46,723
No. Stop. Don't do that.
Please, don't do this.

163
00:15:47,011 --> 00:15:50,801
Ma'am, he just disobeyed
a direct order from a police officer.

164
00:15:51,213 --> 00:15:55,288
- I'm afraid I'll have to place him under arrest.
- You've gotta be kidding me.

165
00:16:34,035 --> 00:16:37,074
You know Richard Walsh was killed tonight.

166
00:16:37,158 --> 00:16:39,832
Scott Baylor, too.

167
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:43,394
Did you know Jack was there
when it happened?

168
00:16:43,481 --> 00:16:45,552
I don't know anything about it.

169
00:16:47,843 --> 00:16:51,076
- And you have no idea where he is now?
- No.

170
00:16:52,165 --> 00:16:54,760
- You're making a big mistake, Nina.
- No, you are.

171
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:58,079
When this lockdown is over,
I'll talk with the Double I team,

172
00:16:58,169 --> 00:17:01,958
about some highly irregular banking
transactions traced to your account.

173
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:07,002
Trust me, the trouble Jack's in, my bank
accounts won't even raise an eyebrow.

174
00:17:08,053 --> 00:17:12,526
He's going down, Nina. But that doesn't
mean you have to go down with him.

175
00:17:15,497 --> 00:17:17,967
True love is a beautiful thing, but...

176
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:22,051
why go to extremes?

177
00:17:26,704 --> 00:17:31,096
I know about the affair.
I mean, Jack talks about it all the time.

178
00:17:32,346 --> 00:17:35,339
- Sure he does.
- How else would I know about it?

179
00:17:37,428 --> 00:17:42,266
See, it is possible that Jack's not
the shining knight you think he is.

180
00:17:46,113 --> 00:17:48,913
You wanna try again?

181
00:17:48,995 --> 00:17:51,226
Where's Jack now?

182
00:18:27,095 --> 00:18:32,330
This is Mary-138. Need a
transportation unit at the Fifth Street bridge.

183
00:18:32,418 --> 00:18:35,411
Ma'am. OK. Please, ma'am.

184
00:18:35,499 --> 00:18:38,857
1- M-38.
Repeat location with full request.

185
00:18:38,941 --> 00:18:41,696
1- Mary-38. I need a transportation unit.

186
00:18:44,944 --> 00:18:47,584
It's Teri. Leave a message,
and I'll call you back.

187
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:51,899
Honey, it's me. I'm just checking up
on Kim. I'll call you back soon.

188
00:20:20,274 --> 00:20:22,152
Don't move.

189
00:20:27,518 --> 00:20:29,316
Dammit!

190
00:20:37,163 --> 00:20:43,321
2- Adam-14. Reporting shots fired at
18166 San Fernando Road. Request backup.

191
00:20:43,406 --> 00:20:49,484
2- Adam-14.
Backup on the way, 18166 San Fernando.

192
00:20:52,371 --> 00:20:54,567
Stop! Police!

193
00:20:54,651 --> 00:20:56,723
- Hold it right there!
- Federal agent.

194
00:20:56,813 --> 00:21:00,046
- Your badge. Nice and slow.
- Putting my gun down.

195
00:21:05,417 --> 00:21:08,809
- CTU? What the hell is that?
- Counter Terrorist Unit.

196
00:21:08,899 --> 00:21:13,896
This guy is not waiting for me, so you
better shoot me or help me, but decide now.

197
00:21:16,383 --> 00:21:19,502
- All right, I'll help you.
- I'm picking up my gun.

198
00:21:19,585 --> 00:21:21,258
Easy.

199
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:31,743
You be careful with that gun. I need him alive.

200
00:21:40,355 --> 00:21:42,347
Throw me your flashlight.

201
00:22:20,576 --> 00:22:22,568
Take cover.

202
00:22:39,106 --> 00:22:42,657
- 2-Adam-14. Backup's on the way.
- 2-Adam-14. Copy.

203
00:22:42,749 --> 00:22:44,741
Turn off your radio.

204
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:47,860
- I wish you hadn't called for backup.
- Why?

205
00:22:47,951 --> 00:22:51,423
Cops have to play by the rules.
I'll have to break a few with this guy.

206
00:22:51,513 --> 00:22:53,505
Who is he?

207
00:23:01,318 --> 00:23:06,519
So to sum it up, Jack leaves his wife,
shacks up with you for a while,

208
00:23:06,601 --> 00:23:11,393
gets bored, and then moves back home,
leaving you out in the cold.

209
00:23:12,683 --> 00:23:15,199
My personal life is not your concern.

210
00:23:15,286 --> 00:23:18,882
- It is if it affects your work.
- It doesn't affect my work.

211
00:23:22,409 --> 00:23:26,006
How long have you been with
the agency, Nina? Six years, seven?

212
00:23:26,091 --> 00:23:27,969
Seven years.

213
00:23:28,051 --> 00:23:32,844
I remember when you first joined.
You were goin' places. Everybody knew it.

214
00:23:34,616 --> 00:23:37,529
It hasn't quite happened
for you yet, has it?

215
00:23:37,617 --> 00:23:40,611
- You ever wonder why?
- I've done all right.

216
00:23:40,698 --> 00:23:45,138
But you could have done so much better.
You had a great reputation once.

217
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:47,690
You know what your reputation is now?

218
00:23:48,823 --> 00:23:51,976
Jack's flunky. His lapdog.

219
00:23:53,025 --> 00:23:56,018
This is your chance
to get back on track, Nina.

220
00:23:57,587 --> 00:24:00,342
He's a loose cannon.
Rules don't apply to Jack Bauer.

221
00:24:00,429 --> 00:24:05,141
He does what he wants when he wants,
and he doesn't care whose life it affects.

222
00:24:05,232 --> 00:24:07,871
He shot me with a trank gun,
for God's sakes.

223
00:24:07,953 --> 00:24:10,991
- You withheld information.
- I was following orders.

224
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:13,715
Maybe he's following orders
you don't know about.

225
00:24:13,796 --> 00:24:17,312
He violated lockdown,
and he left you holding the bag.

226
00:24:17,398 --> 00:24:21,029
If he cared about you,
he wouldn't have put you in that position.

227
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,760
Let me ask you, would you
have done that to him?

228
00:24:26,162 --> 00:24:30,602
Fact is, I'm just asking you to do
your job and tell me where he is.

229
00:24:32,126 --> 00:24:34,118
I don't know.

230
00:25:01,461 --> 00:25:03,453
Get down! Get down!

231
00:25:10,865 --> 00:25:12,857
Sí. Bueno.

232
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:41,036
- Maybe she's dead after all.
- We have to be sure.

233
00:25:48,365 --> 00:25:51,165
- Let's just put her in the van.
- No.

234
00:26:03,533 --> 00:26:05,526
- Dan...
- Shut up!

235
00:26:21,863 --> 00:26:23,616
Move it!

236
00:27:17,492 --> 00:27:18,242
Yeah?

237
00:27:18,332 --> 00:27:21,564
- Mason's gonna wanna talk to you.
- What do you want me to say?

238
00:27:21,654 --> 00:27:25,444
Jack's made it clear that
the three of us work in confidence.

239
00:27:26,296 --> 00:27:29,370
- But doesn't Mason supersede Jack?
- No, no.

240
00:27:29,458 --> 00:27:32,212
What we're doing came from Walsh.

241
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:36,495
George will say anything to get you to talk.

242
00:27:36,581 --> 00:27:38,732
Do not be intimidated by him.

243
00:27:40,544 --> 00:27:41,613
OK.

244
00:28:14,802 --> 00:28:16,794
Cross me.

245
00:28:54,623 --> 00:28:58,219
- The other building.
- Jeez, this place is like a maze.

246
00:28:59,064 --> 00:29:03,778
All right. I've got a name.
George Ferragamo. Know him?

247
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:06,257
Yeah. I know the name.

248
00:29:08,949 --> 00:29:12,341
You find anything else, leave
a message on the 802 number only.

249
00:29:12,432 --> 00:29:14,867
OK. You got it.

250
00:29:14,953 --> 00:29:16,945
Thanks, Carl.

251
00:29:42,567 --> 00:29:46,882
You've been spending an awful lot of time
behind closed doors, making phone calls.

252
00:29:46,969 --> 00:29:49,485
- Have I?
- What's going on, David?

253
00:29:56,215 --> 00:30:00,005
Phone call earlier tonight
from Maureen Kingsley.

254
00:30:03,139 --> 00:30:06,212
She's digging up old history.

255
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:08,292
Bad history.

256
00:30:09,741 --> 00:30:11,733
Just tell me.

257
00:30:20,307 --> 00:30:23,300
She claims that Keith
murdered the boy who raped Nicole.

258
00:30:23,389 --> 00:30:25,665
What?

259
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:29,870
Well, first, Lyle Gibson
was no boy. He was 19.

260
00:30:29,952 --> 00:30:34,072
Second, he killed himself.
The coroner's report proved it.

261
00:30:34,155 --> 00:30:37,786
- Maureen has new evidence.
- What evidence?

262
00:30:38,836 --> 00:30:40,828
I put Carl on it.

263
00:30:41,998 --> 00:30:45,151
He came up with a name. George Ferragamo.

264
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:50,236
That's the therapist Keith went to.
What about him?

265
00:30:50,323 --> 00:30:54,523
- He claims that...
- Not that Keith confessed in therapy?

266
00:30:54,606 --> 00:30:56,801
- Apparently.
- Well, then he's lying.

267
00:30:56,886 --> 00:31:01,804
- You've gotta get our lawyers on this.
- Yeah, I know. I will.

268
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:06,050
- But, you know...
- What is it, David?

269
00:31:08,412 --> 00:31:13,409
I just don't understand it.
Maureen's always been very responsible,

270
00:31:13,495 --> 00:31:16,454
one of the few real professionals left.

271
00:31:16,537 --> 00:31:18,927
Well, I'd call this unprofessional.

272
00:31:21,419 --> 00:31:23,217
David!

273
00:31:24,621 --> 00:31:28,615
David, you can't seriously think
that our son might be a killer?

274
00:31:31,864 --> 00:31:33,856
No, of course not.

275
00:31:40,509 --> 00:31:43,264
- Look, I apologised.
- You don't get it, do you?

276
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:46,469
- You've committed a serious crime.
- Officer, please.

277
00:31:46,552 --> 00:31:49,113
Clearly he's upset. We both are.

278
00:31:49,194 --> 00:31:51,833
If you could just give us a break, please.

279
00:31:54,437 --> 00:31:57,669
- 1-Mary-38.
- 1-Mary-38. Go.

280
00:31:57,758 --> 00:32:02,835
1- Mary-38. That emergency call was placed at
that location approximately 30 minutes ago.

281
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,913
Copy. Thanks.

282
00:32:09,044 --> 00:32:12,880
That still doesn't justify you
disobeying a police officer.

283
00:32:12,966 --> 00:32:14,958
Idiot!

284
00:32:30,255 --> 00:32:34,250
- Ground units'll be on their way.
- I need him now to claim jurisdiction.

285
00:32:34,337 --> 00:32:37,649
- Where do you want me?
- Keep him pinned down at the exit.

286
00:32:37,739 --> 00:32:40,573
I'll try and go round
the other side. Don't hit him.

287
00:32:40,661 --> 00:32:43,938
- I won't.
- Don't hit me either.

288
00:33:09,716 --> 00:33:12,789
This is the police.
Drop your weapon.

289
00:33:23,923 --> 00:33:26,154
¡Dios mío! ¡Por favor! ¡Por favor!

290
00:33:26,245 --> 00:33:29,044
- I told you to stay put!
- Yo no hice nada.

291
00:33:51,257 --> 00:33:53,249
Over here!

292
00:33:53,338 --> 00:33:57,812
- You want me, come and get me.
- Don't do it! He'll kill both of us!

293
00:34:00,582 --> 00:34:02,574
Don't do it!

294
00:34:05,504 --> 00:34:07,541
Come out! Drop the gun!

295
00:34:07,626 --> 00:34:08,742
Don't!

296
00:34:08,826 --> 00:34:12,538
Step out where I can see you
and throw down the gun.

297
00:34:12,629 --> 00:34:14,268
Don't do it!

298
00:34:14,349 --> 00:34:17,309
- I'll drop the gun, but you've gotta relax.
- Don't do it.

299
00:34:17,391 --> 00:34:19,428
Shut up. Put down the gun.

300
00:34:20,872 --> 00:34:23,069
Speak English, asshole!

301
00:34:23,154 --> 00:34:26,785
I'm putting down the gun!
The gun's going down.

302
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:37,030
Good work. Throw me your cuffs.

303
00:34:38,041 --> 00:34:40,033
Oh, my God.

304
00:34:47,047 --> 00:34:50,518
I think it might be up here,
somewhere to the right.

305
00:34:51,969 --> 00:34:53,961
Yeah, maybe.

306
00:34:55,611 --> 00:35:00,608
There's someone up ahead. Maybe
they saw something. Roll down your window.

307
00:35:02,295 --> 00:35:05,891
Excuse me. Could you tell me
what happened here, please?

308
00:35:05,976 --> 00:35:09,732
- It might involve our children.
- You shouldn't let your children come here.

309
00:35:09,818 --> 00:35:13,290
Yeah, I know. But could you just
please tell me what happened?

310
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:16,340
Girl was hit by a car.

311
00:35:16,422 --> 00:35:19,257
Do you know where they took her?

312
00:35:19,343 --> 00:35:21,335
St Mark's is closest.

313
00:35:23,306 --> 00:35:25,217
Was she alive?

314
00:35:25,306 --> 00:35:28,380
- She didn't look good.
- Go, go, go, go.

315
00:35:42,636 --> 00:35:44,628
Hey, it's Gaines.

316
00:36:13,411 --> 00:36:17,805
- Where's the other one?
- She was a problem, so we killed her.

317
00:36:19,094 --> 00:36:21,451
- The body?
- No one'll find it.

318
00:36:22,697 --> 00:36:24,767
- She been any trouble?
- Not at all.

319
00:36:37,024 --> 00:36:39,664
You're with me now.

320
00:36:39,746 --> 00:36:44,458
Be good, you'll be back at the mall
in a day or two. Be bad, you won't. Clear?

321
00:36:47,069 --> 00:36:49,220
- Mm-hm.
- Good.

322
00:36:54,913 --> 00:36:57,382
Agent Farrell, come with me, please.

323
00:37:06,279 --> 00:37:07,759
Jamey.

324
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:10,514
I've already told these men,
I don't know anything.

325
00:37:10,602 --> 00:37:14,722
Tryin' to protect Jack and Nina?
Don't be naive.

326
00:37:15,444 --> 00:37:17,242
Sit.

327
00:37:20,207 --> 00:37:22,961
Let me tell you how the game is played.

328
00:37:23,048 --> 00:37:27,521
First thing they do is to tell you
that you're the only one they can trust.

329
00:37:27,611 --> 00:37:32,084
That's flattering, and it makes
you trust them in return. All right?

330
00:37:32,173 --> 00:37:35,166
Then they get you to do
something you shouldn't.

331
00:37:35,254 --> 00:37:39,044
Say you don't know where
Jack went, for example.

332
00:37:41,058 --> 00:37:44,688
The next thing you know, Jack's gone,

333
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:48,012
Nina's stonewalling,
and you're in the hot seat.

334
00:37:48,101 --> 00:37:50,093
Sound familiar?

335
00:37:50,742 --> 00:37:55,978
Hey, you're being used.
I've seen it a million times.

336
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:59,343
If you help me out, I'll help you out.

337
00:37:59,427 --> 00:38:01,383
If you hold out...

338
00:38:10,513 --> 00:38:12,390
Mason.

339
00:38:12,474 --> 00:38:15,353
Really? Good. I'm on my way.

340
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:20,626
Seems our boy's surfaced. His name
popped up on a police frequency.

341
00:38:20,718 --> 00:38:23,712
- Not that I'm surprised.
- Is he in trouble?

342
00:38:28,562 --> 00:38:31,840
Off the record, just out of curiosity,

343
00:38:31,924 --> 00:38:34,394
what's so special about Jack Bauer?

344
00:38:37,767 --> 00:38:41,318
All right, we've found Bauer.
We're pulling out. Lockdown's over.

345
00:38:41,409 --> 00:38:44,766
Hope you give some thought
to what we talked about.

346
00:38:48,652 --> 00:38:51,122
Call it in as a DOA.

347
00:39:05,941 --> 00:39:09,379
Everything checked out. Here you go.

348
00:39:09,464 --> 00:39:11,420
What was her name?

349
00:39:11,505 --> 00:39:13,063
Jessie Hampton.

350
00:39:15,187 --> 00:39:17,463
Know anything about this guy?

351
00:39:17,548 --> 00:39:21,428
- No. I gotta take him in for questioning.
- Maybe you didn't notice, he killed a cop.

352
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:26,222
- But there's something else at stake here.
- Not to me. Not to these guys.

353
00:39:29,874 --> 00:39:31,866
All right.

354
00:39:31,956 --> 00:39:34,391
Can I at least have a few minutes with him?

355
00:39:36,918 --> 00:39:39,035
Guys.

356
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:41,111
Thank you.

357
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,872
Get up.

358
00:39:46,043 --> 00:39:48,399
If you tell me who you are,
I might be able to help you.

359
00:39:48,484 --> 00:39:52,035
- Don't let them take me. If they do, I'm dead.
- They seem in control.

360
00:39:52,126 --> 00:39:54,516
I'm not worried about them.

361
00:39:55,487 --> 00:39:58,287
- Who are you worried about?
- You spring me, then I talk.

362
00:39:58,369 --> 00:40:01,408
- That's not gonna happen.
- That's too bad...

363
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:03,164
Bauer.

364
00:40:03,252 --> 00:40:05,528
Bauer. How do you know my name?

365
00:40:05,612 --> 00:40:07,127
Time's up.

366
00:40:07,214 --> 00:40:11,846
I know more than that. If you ever wanna see
your daughter again, get me outta this.

367
00:40:12,056 --> 00:40:14,572
What do you know about my daughter?!

368
00:40:16,458 --> 00:40:18,416
I'm fine! I'm fine!

369
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,297
I'm fine.
