1
00:00:12,848 --> 00:00:14,832
President Hassan's security forces--

2
00:00:14,975 --> 00:00:16,172
they're still cracking down on the opposition

3
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:18,116
and they're not showing any signs of letting up.

4
00:00:18,945 --> 00:00:20,345
The rumors have already started

5
00:00:20,441 --> 00:00:23,726
that the British are pulling out as signatories to the accord.

6
00:00:23,836 --> 00:00:25,187
Assemble the representatives.

7
00:00:25,296 --> 00:00:26,958
I want to appeal to them myself

8
00:00:27,081 --> 00:00:28,298
to stay the course.

9
00:00:28,788 --> 00:00:30,132
One of the suspects

10
00:00:30,255 --> 00:00:31,173
has family connections

11
00:00:31,282 --> 00:00:34,033
to a member of our delegation here at the UN.

12
00:00:34,132 --> 00:00:34,852
Who?

13
00:00:35,417 --> 00:00:36,498
Jamot.

14
00:00:37,874 --> 00:00:39,348
Are you arresting me?

15
00:00:39,543 --> 00:00:41,495
I demand to speak with President Hassan.

16
00:00:41,599 --> 00:00:43,881
President Hassan is the one who gave this order.

17
00:00:44,286 --> 00:00:45,613
What's wrong? You sound upset.

18
00:00:45,748 --> 00:00:47,303
I need to speak with you about your father.

19
00:00:47,406 --> 00:00:48,892
I have to go to the embassy right now.

20
00:00:49,024 --> 00:00:50,461
I'll meet you in private when I get back.

21
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:52,764
This has the address and schematic

22
00:00:52,818 --> 00:00:53,780
of the evidence lockup.

23
00:00:53,912 --> 00:00:56,066
This keycard will get you access.

24
00:00:56,248 --> 00:00:57,388
How do we find the money?

25
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,626
The evidence bins are numbered.

26
00:00:59,762 --> 00:01:01,695
Do exactly what I tell you to do,

27
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:02,767
and you'll be in and out.

28
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:03,984
No one will know you're there.

29
00:01:04,284 --> 00:01:05,337
The authorities know

30
00:01:05,433 --> 00:01:06,904
about the nuclear material.

31
00:01:07,059 --> 00:01:09,311
Putting Oleg in a clinic would lead them right to us.

32
00:01:10,083 --> 00:01:11,160
No doctors.

33
00:01:11,649 --> 00:01:14,545
The doctor said that Oleg could be treated.

34
00:01:14,835 --> 00:01:16,058
He showed me how.

35
00:01:16,186 --> 00:01:18,385
Who are you to question my judgment?

36
00:01:20,612 --> 00:01:22,544
Never disobey an order from your father.

37
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,031
I'm sorry, my son.

38
00:01:27,804 --> 00:01:29,226
Tell me about this buyer.

39
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:30,763
His name is Ernst Meier,

40
00:01:30,885 --> 00:01:32,009
German arms dealer.

41
00:01:32,161 --> 00:01:33,224
What's he looking to buy?

42
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:34,799
Weapons-grade uranium.

43
00:01:35,425 --> 00:01:36,793
I'm going to have to meet this Meier,

44
00:01:36,916 --> 00:01:39,247
and I need a good-faith payment up front.

45
00:01:39,395 --> 00:01:40,506
I'm not going to tell you again.

46
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,962
Leave me alone and let me get dressed.

47
00:01:44,022 --> 00:01:45,436
Damn it, come here

48
00:01:45,777 --> 00:01:47,140
or the deal's off.

49
00:01:50,128 --> 00:01:51,070
Meier?

50
00:01:51,248 --> 00:01:52,357
That's right.

51
00:01:53,227 --> 00:01:55,003
Where is the $5 million?

52
00:01:55,395 --> 00:01:57,001
The money is in your account.

53
00:02:01,021 --> 00:02:03,062
Drop the weapon. Now! Drop it!

54
00:02:03,322 --> 00:02:06,243
Meier. You really think you can roll me for $5 million?

55
00:02:06,409 --> 00:02:07,685
Let me talk to my man.

56
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:09,084
Yes.

57
00:02:09,251 --> 00:02:10,296
Bring him back here.

58
00:02:10,656 --> 00:02:11,918
He wants to see you.

59
00:02:12,677 --> 00:02:13,598
Get up.

60
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:19,461
fjdlafjlasjl

61
00:02:26,314 --> 00:02:27,373
Thank you so much.

62
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,455
Well, that went well.

63
00:02:30,823 --> 00:02:32,156
Unanimous support for the treaty--

64
00:02:32,255 --> 00:02:33,866
well, nearly unanimous, anyway.

65
00:02:33,953 --> 00:02:34,938
I have the distinct impression

66
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:36,655
that I am running out of goodwill.

67
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:37,173
Maybe,

68
00:02:37,256 --> 00:02:38,808
but you bought yourself some breathing room.

69
00:02:39,147 --> 00:02:41,324
These people are already up past their bedtimes.

70
00:02:41,433 --> 00:02:42,607
I don't think we'll be hearing any more grousing

71
00:02:42,695 --> 00:02:44,379
until tomorrow morning at the earliest.

72
00:02:45,344 --> 00:02:47,228
Congratulations, Madam President.

73
00:02:47,364 --> 00:02:49,755
Thank you, I appreciated your support.

74
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:50,391
Good.

75
00:02:50,495 --> 00:02:53,440
Now I hope you'll explain to me what's really going on.

76
00:02:53,686 --> 00:02:54,833
I thought I did.

77
00:02:54,938 --> 00:02:56,444
You invoked national security,

78
00:02:56,565 --> 00:02:58,227
which, with respect, is not an explanation.

79
00:02:58,351 --> 00:02:59,660
It's saying "Don't ask."

80
00:03:00,334 --> 00:03:01,168
Madam President,

81
00:03:01,252 --> 00:03:03,158
our countries have a unique relationship

82
00:03:03,504 --> 00:03:05,884
based on a trust developed over nearly a century now.

83
00:03:06,113 --> 00:03:07,421
Anything you say to me is

84
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:09,177
in the strictest confidence.

85
00:03:11,084 --> 00:03:13,746
You may tell your prime minister and no one else

86
00:03:13,865 --> 00:03:15,644
that President Hassan's crackdown

87
00:03:15,757 --> 00:03:18,247
isn't just a response to the attempt on his life.

88
00:03:18,627 --> 00:03:21,528
There are unsecured nuclear materials in play.

89
00:03:22,048 --> 00:03:25,085
Apparently a faction inside his country was so disturbed

90
00:03:25,188 --> 00:03:26,190
by the prospect of disarmament,

91
00:03:26,283 --> 00:03:28,472
they decided to take matters into their own hands.

92
00:03:28,567 --> 00:03:29,597
Where are the materials?

93
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,193
Here on our soil.

94
00:03:31,546 --> 00:03:34,035
CTU is running an undercover operation

95
00:03:34,119 --> 00:03:35,790
to retrieve them as we speak.

96
00:03:42,453 --> 00:03:43,334
Who is that?

97
00:03:43,579 --> 00:03:45,472
My guess is, it is my backup.

98
00:03:45,941 --> 00:03:47,768
No calls till we get to Vladimir.

99
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:48,807
Does this look like a situation

100
00:03:48,917 --> 00:03:50,426
where you get to make demands?

101
00:03:51,248 --> 00:03:52,231
It's Meier.

102
00:03:52,431 --> 00:03:53,551
I lost my sight line on you.

103
00:03:53,615 --> 00:03:54,376
I'm leaving the building.

104
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:55,585
I understand.

105
00:03:55,711 --> 00:03:56,701
Everything okay?

106
00:03:57,087 --> 00:03:58,968
The money's been transferred to Vladimir's account.

107
00:03:59,092 --> 00:03:59,790
We're going to his office.

108
00:03:59,813 --> 00:04:00,874
We should be there in a few minutes.

109
00:04:00,973 --> 00:04:02,341
I'll follow with a backup team.

110
00:04:02,921 --> 00:04:04,163
That might not be necessary.

111
00:04:04,299 --> 00:04:05,033
After what they just pulled,

112
00:04:05,096 --> 00:04:06,934
you're sure you're comfortable without backup?

113
00:04:07,318 --> 00:04:08,729
There are other considerations.

114
00:04:09,155 --> 00:04:10,289
You mean they have Renee.

115
00:04:10,548 --> 00:04:11,462
That's right.

116
00:04:12,771 --> 00:04:13,862
Okay, we'll stay back.

117
00:04:14,053 --> 00:04:15,037
I'll let you know.

118
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:17,294
What was that?

119
00:04:17,645 --> 00:04:18,566
Let him know what?

120
00:04:18,696 --> 00:04:19,844
Shut up and drive.

121
00:04:22,014 --> 00:04:23,608
Okay, I got 'em on traffic cam.

122
00:04:24,712 --> 00:04:25,709
Is everything okay?

123
00:04:28,927 --> 00:04:30,734
Jack seems to be in control.

124
00:04:30,961 --> 00:04:32,531
Looks fine, all things considered.

125
00:04:32,691 --> 00:04:34,188
Driver looks a little worried.

126
00:04:34,466 --> 00:04:35,709
Who is this guy anyway?

127
00:04:35,836 --> 00:04:37,795
Should I pass him on to facial recognition?

128
00:04:39,558 --> 00:04:40,445
Dana?

129
00:04:40,672 --> 00:04:41,752
I've got to take this.

130
00:04:41,856 --> 00:04:44,136
Yeah, sure, no biggie.

131
00:04:44,264 --> 00:04:46,864
Just unsecured nuclear materials.

132
00:04:50,359 --> 00:04:51,136
Yes.

133
00:04:51,216 --> 00:04:53,533
We're there, outside the evidence building.

134
00:04:54,158 --> 00:04:55,766
You're in the side alley, right?

135
00:04:55,956 --> 00:04:56,887
No,

136
00:04:57,058 --> 00:04:58,759
we parked out front so everyone can see us.

137
00:04:59,453 --> 00:05:00,599
Come on, what do you think I am?

138
00:05:00,732 --> 00:05:02,882
Okay, look, I need to walk you through this step by step.

139
00:05:02,998 --> 00:05:04,100
I know, we're ready.

140
00:05:04,222 --> 00:05:05,725
Well, something just came up here and I need you to hang on

141
00:05:05,861 --> 00:05:06,666
for a few minutes.

142
00:05:06,805 --> 00:05:08,907
Here? We're kind of exposed, Jenny.

143
00:05:09,073 --> 00:05:10,982
You'll be fine if you just stay still.

144
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:13,321
We have a 30-minute window before the next security pass.

145
00:05:13,432 --> 00:05:14,850
I will be with you the second I can.

146
00:05:15,359 --> 00:05:17,993
Arlo, Hastings wants us in his office for a field update.

147
00:05:18,108 --> 00:05:19,980
Can I ask you a hypothetical question?

148
00:05:22,967 --> 00:05:25,261
If it's about Dana, it's not hypothetical.

149
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:27,630
If your fianc? Was cheating on you,

150
00:05:27,756 --> 00:05:28,832
would you want to know?

151
00:05:29,284 --> 00:05:30,911
Hypothetically, who'd be asking--

152
00:05:31,024 --> 00:05:32,952
some creepy stalker who's about to get fired?

153
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:34,527
I'm serious.

154
00:05:34,692 --> 00:05:35,906
So am I. Just go upstairs.

155
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:37,023
It's none of your business.

156
00:05:41,747 --> 00:05:43,588
Dana, Cole just called about Jack.

157
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,502
He's almost to Laitanan.

158
00:05:44,617 --> 00:05:46,467
Hastings wants us in his office.

159
00:05:57,747 --> 00:05:58,963
Pass me back the keys.

160
00:06:07,589 --> 00:06:08,710
Slowly get out,

161
00:06:08,905 --> 00:06:10,188
put your hands on the roof.

162
00:06:16,511 --> 00:06:17,608
Let's go.

163
00:06:29,027 --> 00:06:30,708
So this is how you do business?

164
00:06:30,847 --> 00:06:32,254
I wire you the $5 million

165
00:06:32,354 --> 00:06:36,097
like we agreed, and then you try and take me out.

166
00:06:36,746 --> 00:06:38,379
I did not think you were for real.

167
00:06:38,942 --> 00:06:40,622
It was a misunderstanding,

168
00:06:40,784 --> 00:06:42,040
but it's past.

169
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:43,351
We are here.

170
00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:44,508
As an act of good faith,

171
00:06:44,672 --> 00:06:46,713
Vladimir has already started calling his contacts,

172
00:06:46,855 --> 00:06:48,710
inquiring about the nuclear materials.

173
00:06:48,855 --> 00:06:50,041
I don't care what he's done.

174
00:06:50,148 --> 00:06:51,431
I want to talk to you.

175
00:06:51,563 --> 00:06:52,527
So talk.

176
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:05,733
I want to talk to my partner alone now.

177
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:11,369
Look, he's upset,

178
00:07:11,453 --> 00:07:12,641
understandably.

179
00:07:12,756 --> 00:07:13,579
It will be fine.

180
00:07:13,696 --> 00:07:14,434
Yeah?

181
00:07:20,577 --> 00:07:21,776
This is our chance.

182
00:07:21,925 --> 00:07:23,336
We should take him out now.

183
00:07:23,465 --> 00:07:25,878
No, we need him to do this deal.

184
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,071
Don't risk everything for a whore.

185
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:31,101
You ever talk about her like that again,

186
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:32,483
I'll kill you.

187
00:07:32,999 --> 00:07:34,247
You understand?

188
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:36,415
What the hell are you doing?

189
00:07:36,527 --> 00:07:38,203
I have authorization to pull you out.

190
00:07:38,863 --> 00:07:40,238
No, that's not possible.

191
00:07:40,341 --> 00:07:42,539
Renee, you've taken us this far, I'm going to finish it.

192
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:44,997
Jack, you can't. He doesn't trust you, first of all.

193
00:07:45,095 --> 00:07:46,854
The only reason he's agreeing to continue this is me.

194
00:07:46,926 --> 00:07:48,339
I'm fine, really.

195
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:52,941
You want to make calls,

196
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:53,925
let's go.

197
00:07:54,787 --> 00:07:55,485
You don't have a say in this.

198
00:07:55,596 --> 00:07:57,355
I am pulling you out. No, look,

199
00:07:57,446 --> 00:07:58,650
it's not a big deal.

200
00:07:58,817 --> 00:08:00,439
I know what he did to you six years ago,

201
00:08:00,615 --> 00:08:01,796
and it is a big deal.

202
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:03,366
Jack, if we stop this now,

203
00:08:03,451 --> 00:08:05,911
then everything that I have done is for nothing.

204
00:08:07,252 --> 00:08:08,287
We're running out of time.

205
00:08:08,338 --> 00:08:09,262
Let's go.

206
00:08:09,594 --> 00:08:11,356
We're almost there, it'll be worth it.

207
00:08:34,203 --> 00:08:35,340
Kevin, are you there?

208
00:08:35,955 --> 00:08:37,089
Yeah.

209
00:08:37,448 --> 00:08:38,682
I thought you forgot about us.

210
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:40,670
I wish I could.

211
00:08:40,866 --> 00:08:41,739
Come on, don't be like that.

212
00:08:41,846 --> 00:08:42,709
Are we good to go?

213
00:08:56,447 --> 00:08:57,709
Yes, move now.

214
00:08:57,935 --> 00:08:58,671
Let's go.

215
00:09:00,014 --> 00:09:01,670
There's a security panel next to the door.

216
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:02,672
Use the keycard I gave you.

217
00:09:02,769 --> 00:09:06,619
The code is 1668.

218
00:09:06,967 --> 00:09:08,709
1668.

219
00:09:09,983 --> 00:09:12,409
166...

220
00:09:22,996 --> 00:09:25,127
Keep moving, it will stop in a second.

221
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:26,736
If you want the $120,000

222
00:09:26,821 --> 00:09:29,133
you will be out of there in less than 20 minutes.

223
00:09:30,001 --> 00:09:31,293
Okay, which door is it?

224
00:09:32,612 --> 00:09:33,795
It's the last one on the left.

225
00:09:33,885 --> 00:09:37,945
The code is 4660.

226
00:09:40,781 --> 00:09:43,480
Four...

227
00:09:52,598 --> 00:09:55,782
It's like Christmas... with chain link.

228
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:58,203
Okay, how do we find the money?

229
00:09:59,311 --> 00:10:02,435
It's in section 3101.

230
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,610
3101. It's down the aisle on your left.

231
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:08,086
3101. The code is 2824.

232
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:15,254
The last one on the left.

233
00:10:18,698 --> 00:10:20,408
3101-- do you see it?

234
00:10:21,325 --> 00:10:23,739
Yeah, right here.

235
00:10:29,431 --> 00:10:30,138
What the hell, man?

236
00:10:30,188 --> 00:10:31,404
Jen, what the hell is going on?

237
00:10:32,503 --> 00:10:33,624
What number is it?

238
00:10:33,823 --> 00:10:35,128
Is it 3101?

239
00:10:35,547 --> 00:10:37,753
3101-- this is 3110.

240
00:10:37,997 --> 00:10:38,553
Come on.

241
00:10:38,641 --> 00:10:39,639
What is wrong with you two?

242
00:10:39,747 --> 00:10:40,770
Hey, it's called a mistake, all right?

243
00:10:40,871 --> 00:10:41,570
Back off.

244
00:10:41,763 --> 00:10:43,039
So where is it?

245
00:10:43,466 --> 00:10:47,916
3101 is down the aisle on the left.

246
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:51,954
Down here, down here. The code is 2824.

247
00:10:52,035 --> 00:10:54,880
2824, 2824, 2824.

248
00:11:01,476 --> 00:11:03,496
Bin number's 4301.

249
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,303
4301.

250
00:11:05,524 --> 00:11:06,770
Oh, man, it's too many numbers.

251
00:11:06,867 --> 00:11:09,689
4301, 4301.

252
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:10,984
Boom! Got it!

253
00:11:17,557 --> 00:11:18,948
That's beautiful, man.

254
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:20,552
That's beautiful.

255
00:11:22,281 --> 00:11:23,741
Just shut up and get out of there.

256
00:11:23,903 --> 00:11:26,039
The next patrol is in less than 15 minutes.

257
00:11:26,255 --> 00:11:27,444
You've got the money.

258
00:11:27,689 --> 00:11:29,373
Close the doors and leave.

259
00:11:29,446 --> 00:11:30,709
15 minutes. We're leaving.

260
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:31,869
Call me when you're clear.

261
00:11:32,363 --> 00:11:33,558
I sure will, Jenny.

262
00:11:36,343 --> 00:11:37,224
Let's go!

263
00:11:37,641 --> 00:11:38,701
Not yet.

264
00:11:40,472 --> 00:11:42,001
Check out some of this stuff.

265
00:11:42,218 --> 00:11:43,218
Hey, seriously, come on, man.

266
00:11:43,298 --> 00:11:44,382
Patrol's on its way.

267
00:11:45,412 --> 00:11:47,579
Yeah, 15 minutes.

268
00:12:15,002 --> 00:12:16,403
Are you sure, then?

269
00:12:16,526 --> 00:12:17,591
You haven't heard of anyone

270
00:12:17,665 --> 00:12:18,971
dealing in these materials?

271
00:12:19,983 --> 00:12:24,188
All right. Well, thank you for your time.

272
00:12:24,239 --> 00:12:25,535
I'm sorry to trouble you.

273
00:12:28,152 --> 00:12:29,038
Nothing.

274
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:30,997
They did not appreciate being called so late.

275
00:12:31,188 --> 00:12:32,410
Renee, cut me some bread.

276
00:12:44,409 --> 00:12:45,384
Here.

277
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,420
You might want to ease up on the drinking.

278
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:54,174
You've got some calls to make.

279
00:12:54,298 --> 00:12:55,684
I drink what I want.

280
00:12:57,035 --> 00:12:58,491
Renee, where's the bread?

281
00:12:58,841 --> 00:12:59,917
Coming.

282
00:13:00,218 --> 00:13:01,184
Drink.

283
00:13:08,914 --> 00:13:09,988
What is this?

284
00:13:11,447 --> 00:13:12,678
It is too thin.

285
00:13:14,201 --> 00:13:15,416
It should be thick.

286
00:13:18,619 --> 00:13:20,264
Nice and thick.

287
00:13:21,192 --> 00:13:22,324
There we are.

288
00:13:26,748 --> 00:13:28,246
She's changed, you know?

289
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:32,179
Six years ago,

290
00:13:32,677 --> 00:13:34,468
she thought she was too good for me.

291
00:13:34,932 --> 00:13:37,165
Now, she is much more friendly.

292
00:13:40,179 --> 00:13:43,184
Maybe I should thank you-- all that time you were together

293
00:13:43,267 --> 00:13:44,577
in Mexico City.

294
00:13:45,826 --> 00:13:46,977
Come on.

295
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,691
I see how you look at her.

296
00:13:50,318 --> 00:13:51,343
Don't tell me you didn't.

297
00:13:51,441 --> 00:13:53,949
You want to keep talking, do it on the phone.

298
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:55,943
Otherwise, the nuclear

299
00:13:56,034 --> 00:13:58,858
materials will be gone, and this deal will be dead.

300
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:07,025
Fine, but I don't like you breathing down my neck.

301
00:14:07,089 --> 00:14:09,027
Lugo, get him out of here.

302
00:14:10,843 --> 00:14:12,396
And I'm running out of my vodka.

303
00:14:12,508 --> 00:14:13,556
Go get me some more.

304
00:14:23,574 --> 00:14:24,522
Sit down.

305
00:14:32,965 --> 00:14:33,864
I won't be long.

306
00:14:53,055 --> 00:14:54,439
My younger son.

307
00:14:56,384 --> 00:14:58,526
I wanted to bury him, Father Gregor.

308
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:02,342
Of course, but that will take a little time.

309
00:15:02,728 --> 00:15:04,630
The cemetery workers need to prepare the grave...

310
00:15:04,732 --> 00:15:05,986
No. You will do it now

311
00:15:06,632 --> 00:15:07,862
out back.

312
00:15:08,451 --> 00:15:09,935
My men will dig his grave.

313
00:15:12,019 --> 00:15:13,375
Sergei Petrovich,

314
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:14,607
this isn't right.

315
00:15:14,701 --> 00:15:16,103
Then make it right.

316
00:15:16,905 --> 00:15:18,019
Treat him like a soldier

317
00:15:18,073 --> 00:15:20,385
who died on the battlefield and must be buried there.

318
00:15:23,718 --> 00:15:25,055
Is that how he died?

319
00:15:25,318 --> 00:15:26,496
In battle?

320
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:30,231
You just make it right.

321
00:15:30,986 --> 00:15:32,731
Say all the prayers.

322
00:15:33,076 --> 00:15:35,085
Where I end up, I don't care.

323
00:15:38,056 --> 00:15:40,329
But this boy is with the angels.

324
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,806
My men will be with you soon.

325
00:16:01,974 --> 00:16:03,004
Leave us.

326
00:16:14,124 --> 00:16:15,163
Get up.

327
00:16:22,819 --> 00:16:24,211
Look at me, Josef.

328
00:16:25,221 --> 00:16:26,379
I want you to understand

329
00:16:26,512 --> 00:16:28,668
that everything I've done, I've done for you

330
00:16:28,976 --> 00:16:30,559
and for our family.

331
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:33,045
You killed my brother.

332
00:16:33,532 --> 00:16:34,919
Because I loved him,

333
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:38,850
because I couldn't bear to see him suffer,

334
00:16:39,143 --> 00:16:40,971
because there was no other way.

335
00:16:41,116 --> 00:16:43,182
There's always another way.

336
00:16:43,309 --> 00:16:45,957
Not when we are dealing with nuclear materials.

337
00:16:46,082 --> 00:16:48,155
We cannot risk the authorities finding out.

338
00:16:48,224 --> 00:16:49,097
You know that.

339
00:16:50,815 --> 00:16:52,573
You don't know why I'm doing this?

340
00:16:53,876 --> 00:16:55,413
Because when I die,

341
00:16:56,539 --> 00:16:57,541
I want to leave you

342
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:00,062
and your family a worthy inheritance.

343
00:17:00,457 --> 00:17:02,758
Wealth, respect,

344
00:17:03,056 --> 00:17:04,204
consequence.

345
00:17:06,239 --> 00:17:07,885
Can you understand that?

346
00:17:11,289 --> 00:17:12,732
One day you will.

347
00:17:13,565 --> 00:17:15,879
As your son grows older, you will.

348
00:17:17,887 --> 00:17:19,464
And you will understand

349
00:17:20,025 --> 00:17:21,637
how much I love you.

350
00:17:22,582 --> 00:17:24,223
My only son.

351
00:17:32,311 --> 00:17:34,737
Father Gregor is here to bury Oleg.

352
00:17:35,567 --> 00:17:36,788
Will you help him?

353
00:17:38,922 --> 00:17:40,082
He's my brother.

354
00:17:41,596 --> 00:17:42,442
Thank you.

355
00:17:42,962 --> 00:17:44,391
Call when you are ready.

356
00:17:49,367 --> 00:17:50,367
What is it?

357
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:51,777
Vladimir Laitanan.

358
00:17:51,922 --> 00:17:53,255
He says it's important.

359
00:18:01,821 --> 00:18:03,915
Vladimir, what do you want?

360
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:05,378
Sergei Petrovich.

361
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:09,034
I apologize for calling you out of the blue like this, sir.

362
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:11,174
Uh, your family is well?

363
00:18:11,317 --> 00:18:12,624
I said, what do you want?

364
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,449
I have a business proposition.

365
00:18:15,576 --> 00:18:17,995
Then call me in business time, not in the middle of the night.

366
00:18:18,163 --> 00:18:19,476
No, no, no, this can't wait.

367
00:18:20,408 --> 00:18:23,014
I hear there are materials for sale,

368
00:18:23,094 --> 00:18:25,835
expensive materials, dangerous ones.

369
00:18:25,965 --> 00:18:27,717
Talk straight. What materials?

370
00:18:28,955 --> 00:18:30,383
Nuclear rods.

371
00:18:32,391 --> 00:18:34,277
Highly enriched uranium.

372
00:18:35,335 --> 00:18:36,902
So, why are you calling me?

373
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:38,601
If anyone has the organization

374
00:18:38,691 --> 00:18:40,416
to pull off such a deal, it's you.

375
00:18:40,544 --> 00:18:41,440
I'm flattered.

376
00:18:41,563 --> 00:18:44,432
I have a buyer here, a German.

377
00:18:44,553 --> 00:18:47,258
He's willing to pay a great deal of money for them.

378
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:48,884
Double any offer you have.

379
00:18:48,941 --> 00:18:50,516
Then he is as stupid as you are.

380
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:52,476
Are you out of your mind?

381
00:18:52,608 --> 00:18:54,524
Nobody deals in nuclear rods, nobody.

382
00:18:58,224 --> 00:18:59,010
I'm sorry.

383
00:18:59,079 --> 00:19:00,368
A misunderstanding.

384
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:01,621
Don't call me again.

385
00:19:07,352 --> 00:19:09,361
He had no idea what I was talking about.

386
00:19:10,593 --> 00:19:12,237
All right, then we call the next person.

387
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:14,082
You're not listening.

388
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:16,186
He says nobody sells these things.

389
00:19:16,767 --> 00:19:17,569
Nobody.

390
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,765
You're close to the biggest deal of your life, Vladimir.

391
00:19:19,812 --> 00:19:21,680
He's just jealous that he's not in on it.

392
00:19:25,318 --> 00:19:26,808
Come here. Come here.

393
00:19:29,907 --> 00:19:30,701
Look, later.

394
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:32,393
Later.

395
00:19:32,987 --> 00:19:34,559
Once you've made more calls.

396
00:19:35,939 --> 00:19:37,063
Come on.

397
00:19:42,258 --> 00:19:44,512
Okay. Okay, okay, okay.

398
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:48,674
We have a problem.

399
00:19:48,853 --> 00:19:51,172
Vladimir Laitanan knows about the fuel rods.

400
00:19:51,301 --> 00:19:52,455
What are you going to do?

401
00:20:00,285 --> 00:20:00,925
Da.

402
00:20:01,218 --> 00:20:02,134
fafadsfa

403
00:20:02,693 --> 00:20:06,394
fadfasdfa

404
00:20:07,105 --> 00:20:08,317
fadsfasdfa

405
00:20:08,851 --> 00:20:12,210
fasdfasdfasd

406
00:20:17,574 --> 00:20:18,327
Anton?

407
00:20:18,487 --> 00:20:22,001
fdsafasdf

408
00:20:22,297 --> 00:20:24,583
fsadfasdfasdf

409
00:20:58,235 --> 00:20:59,059
Yes?

410
00:20:59,282 --> 00:21:01,223
Mr. President, it's Allison Taylor.

411
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,459
We were scheduled to resume our discussions.

412
00:21:03,706 --> 00:21:05,293
I'm late, I know. I apologize.

413
00:21:05,642 --> 00:21:06,738
The events of this evening...

414
00:21:06,815 --> 00:21:09,000
The events of this evening make it more important than ever

415
00:21:09,111 --> 00:21:11,656
that we complete our work on this treaty.

416
00:21:12,045 --> 00:21:14,789
Mr. President, I need to know your intentions.

417
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:16,902
My intentions?

418
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:19,088
The crackdown on your countrymen.

419
00:21:19,345 --> 00:21:20,006
I've been informed

420
00:21:20,096 --> 00:21:22,244
that you've even arrested one of your own delegation.

421
00:21:22,352 --> 00:21:23,692
That's an internal matter.

422
00:21:24,036 --> 00:21:25,721
No, sir, it is not.

423
00:21:26,061 --> 00:21:27,235
Less than an hour ago,

424
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:29,320
I assured delegates from two dozen countries

425
00:21:29,423 --> 00:21:31,906
that you were still our best hope for peace.

426
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:34,204
I personally guaranteed them you'd observe

427
00:28:02,897 --> 00:28:05,475
Tarin, are you all right?

428
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:07,140
When did you get back from the embassy?

429
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:08,039
Just now.

430
00:28:08,449 --> 00:28:09,332
May I come in?

431
00:28:10,747 --> 00:28:12,018
What is it?

432
00:28:15,371 --> 00:28:16,665
It's only me here.

433
00:28:18,067 --> 00:28:19,166
It's safe.

434
00:28:29,784 --> 00:28:30,812
What's wrong?

435
00:28:32,781 --> 00:28:35,126
You know your father has had many people arrested,

436
00:28:35,126 --> 00:28:36,794
including Jamot.

437
00:28:37,651 --> 00:28:39,319
Now he's having Jamot's wife

438
00:28:39,319 --> 00:28:41,573
and two children detained back home,

439
00:28:41,798 --> 00:28:43,919
so they can be used to force him to talk.

440
00:28:44,972 --> 00:28:45,996
No.

441
00:28:46,754 --> 00:28:48,224
There must be some mistake.

442
00:28:48,224 --> 00:28:49,821
He gave the order himself.

443
00:28:51,675 --> 00:28:53,653
I thought I'd convinced him not to,

444
00:28:53,653 --> 00:28:55,263
but he was lying to me,

445
00:28:55,263 --> 00:28:56,962
he went behind my back.

446
00:28:59,475 --> 00:29:01,997
Kayla, your father is a great man.

447
00:29:02,446 --> 00:29:06,153
I respect him more than anyone I have ever known.

448
00:29:07,082 --> 00:29:09,509
But Farhad's betrayal has changed him.

449
00:29:10,476 --> 00:29:11,770
What can we do?

450
00:29:12,182 --> 00:29:13,904
Open up, please.

451
00:29:18,291 --> 00:29:19,291
What are they doing here?

452
00:29:19,325 --> 00:29:20,759
I don't know.

453
00:29:20,792 --> 00:29:22,059
Open up.

454
00:29:22,092 --> 00:29:24,059
Tarin, stay here.

455
00:29:29,725 --> 00:29:31,725
Yes, Nabeel? Miss Kayla,

456
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:33,191
we've been looking everywhere for Tarin.

457
00:29:33,225 --> 00:29:34,425
Have you seen him?

458
00:29:34,458 --> 00:29:35,892
No.

459
00:29:35,925 --> 00:29:38,358
Is there some problem?

460
00:29:40,325 --> 00:29:41,725
What do you think you're doing?

461
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:42,959
We have orders, Miss Kayla.

462
00:29:42,992 --> 00:29:44,625
I said he wasn't here.

463
00:29:44,659 --> 00:29:46,659
I'm sorry, but I don't believe you.

464
00:29:46,692 --> 00:29:48,092
You can't just barge in here!

465
00:29:48,126 --> 00:29:51,859
I need to talk to my father!

466
00:29:51,892 --> 00:29:53,625
Nabeel.

467
00:29:55,191 --> 00:29:58,059
Why do you need armed guards to come looking for me?

468
00:29:58,092 --> 00:29:59,625
The president says you may be involved with his brother.

469
00:29:59,659 --> 00:30:00,859
Based on what?

470
00:30:00,892 --> 00:30:02,059
Nothing.

471
00:30:02,092 --> 00:30:03,425
Only that I would not allow

472
00:30:03,458 --> 00:30:04,959
an innocent family to be tortured.

473
00:30:04,992 --> 00:30:06,425
He's ordered me to detain you.

474
00:30:06,458 --> 00:30:07,592
I have no choice.

475
00:30:07,625 --> 00:30:09,126
You do have a choice, Nabeel.

476
00:30:09,158 --> 00:30:11,825
Tell my father he's made a mistake,

477
00:30:11,859 --> 00:30:13,625
that there's no one more loyal than Tarin.

478
00:30:13,659 --> 00:30:14,659
Nabeel, this is insane,

479
00:30:14,692 --> 00:30:15,859
and you know it.

480
00:30:15,892 --> 00:30:18,126
Don't make this worse, please.

481
00:30:18,158 --> 00:30:19,458
Don't you see? My hands are tied.

482
00:30:34,225 --> 00:30:35,458
Let me talk to my father.

483
00:30:35,492 --> 00:30:37,692
He's given orders not to be disturbed.

484
00:30:37,725 --> 00:30:39,692
Even by you.

485
00:30:42,458 --> 00:30:44,592
I'll talk to him!

486
00:30:44,625 --> 00:30:46,625
I'll get him to change his mind!

487
00:31:07,358 --> 00:31:08,525
No, I understand, Roman.

488
00:31:08,558 --> 00:31:10,525
We'll do business some other time, okay.

489
00:31:12,325 --> 00:31:14,126
That's it.

490
00:31:14,158 --> 00:31:15,325
Last one.

491
00:31:15,358 --> 00:31:17,026
He also knows nothing about nuclear rods.

492
00:31:17,059 --> 00:31:19,392
He also said it's suicide to deal in them.

493
00:31:19,425 --> 00:31:21,026
Meier has wasted our time.

494
00:31:21,059 --> 00:31:23,026
No, look, Meier's intel is good. So we need to think.

495
00:31:23,059 --> 00:31:24,558
Who else can we call? No one.

496
00:31:24,592 --> 00:31:26,558
I've called everyone who could possibly deal in these things.

497
00:31:26,592 --> 00:31:27,892
Then somebody that you've already talked to

498
00:31:27,925 --> 00:31:28,925
has to know something.

499
00:31:28,959 --> 00:31:30,258
Renee, it's-it's done.

500
00:31:30,291 --> 00:31:31,892
Look, maybe they don't want to admit it.

501
00:31:31,925 --> 00:31:33,592
Maybe they don't know how serious you are.

502
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:35,258
You should call them back. I said no.

503
00:31:35,291 --> 00:31:36,892
Tell them that you have the buyer, tell them you have the money.

504
00:31:36,925 --> 00:31:38,191
Shut up!

505
00:31:38,225 --> 00:31:40,092
Just because I like your face doesn't mean

506
00:31:40,126 --> 00:31:41,425
I have to put up with your crap.

507
00:31:41,458 --> 00:31:42,659
We made $5 million.

508
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:43,859
A good night's work.

509
00:31:43,892 --> 00:31:45,725
Why settle for five when we can have 50?

510
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:49,492
When did you get so greedy?

511
00:31:49,525 --> 00:31:52,892
$5 million is plenty.

512
00:31:52,925 --> 00:31:55,092
Plus we have each other, that's not too bad, is it?

513
00:31:55,126 --> 00:31:57,759
Oh, it's not bad.

514
00:31:57,792 --> 00:31:59,759
But it could be better.

515
00:32:00,825 --> 00:32:01,992
Call them again.

516
00:32:02,026 --> 00:32:03,191
Do it for me.

517
00:32:03,225 --> 00:32:05,558
I said no.

518
00:32:05,592 --> 00:32:07,859
Come on, Vladimir, push them harder.

519
00:32:07,239 --> 00:32:09,663
Somebody knows something. What is your problem?

520
00:32:09,663 --> 00:32:11,309
Nobody knows. There's no one left to call.

521
00:32:11,309 --> 00:32:12,075
Now you go out there

522
00:32:12,075 --> 00:32:13,372
and you tell Meier to leave, okay.

523
00:32:13,372 --> 00:32:14,871
I'm not telling him anything!

524
00:32:14,905 --> 00:32:16,305
What?

525
00:32:16,338 --> 00:32:17,804
Not until you try again.

526
00:32:17,838 --> 00:32:18,971
Look, it's over!

527
00:32:19,005 --> 00:32:20,771
What is wrong with you?! I need this deal.

528
00:32:22,138 --> 00:32:23,905
That is why you're here? The deal?

529
00:32:23,938 --> 00:32:25,938
Why else? Do you think that I'm here for you?

530
00:32:33,372 --> 00:32:34,571
Get up.

531
00:32:41,771 --> 00:32:43,638
Renee.

532
00:32:43,671 --> 00:32:46,504
Stop! Stop!

533
00:32:46,537 --> 00:32:47,871
Stop!

534
00:32:49,571 --> 00:32:51,871
Oh, God.

535
00:32:51,905 --> 00:32:53,272
Oh, God.

536
00:32:54,671 --> 00:32:55,804
Oh, God.

537
00:32:58,238 --> 00:32:59,871
Oh, God!

538
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:21,704
It's all right. It's all right.

539
00:33:21,738 --> 00:33:23,038
It's over.

540
00:33:30,638 --> 00:33:34,038
It's over. It's okay.

541
00:33:47,508 --> 00:33:49,058
Laitanan contacted everyone

542
00:33:49,058 --> 00:33:50,128
he thought might have information

543
00:33:50,128 --> 00:33:51,409
on the nuclear materials.

544
00:33:51,409 --> 00:33:52,576
No one responded.

545
00:33:52,609 --> 00:33:54,177
That's when he said he was finished.

546
00:33:54,209 --> 00:33:56,177
Renee kept pushing him,

547
00:33:56,209 --> 00:33:58,177
and it got ugly.

548
00:33:58,209 --> 00:34:00,077
Laitanan's dead.

549
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:01,676
He attacked her.

550
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:03,177
And so, what, you took him out?

551
00:34:03,209 --> 00:34:05,143
No, she did.

552
00:34:05,177 --> 00:34:06,143
She did?

553
00:34:06,177 --> 00:34:07,309
Half an hour earlier,

554
00:34:07,342 --> 00:34:08,676
she was having sex with the guy.

555
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:10,143
How does that even happen, Jack?

556
00:34:10,177 --> 00:34:11,309
What, she lose it?

557
00:34:11,342 --> 00:34:12,843
She was defending herself.

558
00:34:12,876 --> 00:34:15,077
Look, we knew this guy was violent before we even went in.

559
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:16,242
He's violent?

560
00:34:16,276 --> 00:34:17,843
He's dead on the floor. Yes, he is.

561
00:34:17,876 --> 00:34:19,077
And right, now,

562
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:20,710
we still don't have the nuclear materials secured,

563
00:34:20,743 --> 00:34:21,943
so I suggest we move on.

564
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:23,342
Move on?

565
00:34:23,376 --> 00:34:25,143
He was our only lead, Jack.

566
00:34:25,177 --> 00:34:26,609
Now, where do we move on to?

567
00:34:26,643 --> 00:34:28,843
We can start by working the phone calls that Laitanan made.

568
00:34:28,876 --> 00:34:30,143
There's also physical files here

569
00:34:30,177 --> 00:34:31,710
and a computer to go through.

570
00:34:31,743 --> 00:34:33,143
Yeah, fine. Cole,

571
00:34:33,177 --> 00:34:34,342
are you getting this?

572
00:34:34,376 --> 00:34:35,576
Yes, sir. We're en route

573
00:34:35,609 --> 00:34:37,276
from the staging area, five minutes out.

574
00:34:37,309 --> 00:34:39,209
We're gonna need forensics to rip this place apart.

575
00:34:39,242 --> 00:34:40,443
Yeah, I got Bennett with me.

576
00:34:40,476 --> 00:34:41,776
He can coordinate till the full team arrives.

577
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:42,943
Just do what you can.

578
00:34:42,976 --> 00:34:44,043
And bring Laitanan's body

579
00:34:44,077 --> 00:34:45,177
back here for autopsy.

580
00:34:45,209 --> 00:34:46,876
I want to know what the hell happened.

581
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:48,643
Any other good news?

582
00:34:48,676 --> 00:34:50,309
Jack?

583
00:34:50,342 --> 00:34:51,476
Cole?

584
00:34:51,509 --> 00:34:53,143
Dana?

585
00:34:53,177 --> 00:34:55,110
Excuse me?

586
00:34:55,143 --> 00:34:56,676
I said, anything else?

587
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:59,143
No, sir.

588
00:35:00,209 --> 00:35:02,242
Okay, then.

589
00:35:02,276 --> 00:35:04,043
We'll see you when you get here. COLE: Yes, sir.

590
00:35:05,077 --> 00:35:07,077
Our entire operation just went south.

591
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:10,509
You think you could show a little interest?

592
00:35:10,543 --> 00:35:12,043
Pull it together!

593
00:35:22,177 --> 00:35:24,643
You didn't have to do that.

594
00:35:24,676 --> 00:35:27,143
Do what?

595
00:35:27,177 --> 00:35:29,342
Cover for me with Hastings.

596
00:35:29,376 --> 00:35:32,543
All I did was tell him the truth.

597
00:35:32,576 --> 00:35:36,543
When they see Vladimir, they'll know what happened.

598
00:35:44,443 --> 00:35:46,443
What do you think happened?

599
00:35:48,443 --> 00:35:50,576
It's like you said.

600
00:35:50,609 --> 00:35:52,710
I couldn't handle it.

601
00:35:55,242 --> 00:35:57,010
God, I'm sorry.

602
00:35:57,043 --> 00:35:58,077
It's all right.

603
00:35:58,110 --> 00:35:59,943
No, it's not.

604
00:35:59,976 --> 00:36:01,276
I could have killed you.

605
00:36:03,943 --> 00:36:06,077
I've made such a mess of everything.

606
00:36:07,976 --> 00:36:10,743
I just thought that if... if I did this,

607
00:36:10,776 --> 00:36:12,776
I could make it all right.

608
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:14,409
I could have my life back.

609
00:36:14,443 --> 00:36:16,276
Hey. Hey!

610
00:36:16,309 --> 00:36:19,810
You can have your life back any time you want.

611
00:36:19,843 --> 00:36:21,876
You just need to want it.

612
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:23,876
How?

613
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:26,576
I've tried, and I don't know how.

614
00:36:26,609 --> 00:36:28,509
I don't...

615
00:36:28,543 --> 00:36:32,242
I don't have anything, anyone.

616
00:36:32,276 --> 00:36:35,043
You've got me.

617
00:36:35,077 --> 00:36:38,209
Okay.

618
00:36:38,242 --> 00:36:40,643
Hey. Hey.

619
00:36:40,676 --> 00:36:44,110
Look at me. Look at me.

620
00:36:48,643 --> 00:36:50,110
Okay?

621
00:36:53,409 --> 00:36:55,576
I didn't want it to end like this.

622
00:36:55,609 --> 00:36:58,276
I know.

623
00:36:58,309 --> 00:37:01,509
Look, we're a lot farther ahead than we were three hours ago.

624
00:37:01,543 --> 00:37:03,476
Every call Laitanan made is a solid lead

625
00:37:03,509 --> 00:37:05,910
that we can follow up, and that's because of you.

626
00:37:05,943 --> 00:37:07,810
You did your part.

627
00:37:07,843 --> 00:37:09,976
Now let CTU do their job.

628
00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:12,843
Please?

629
00:37:12,876 --> 00:37:15,576
Let me take you home.

630
00:37:18,876 --> 00:37:20,876
Okay.

631
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:22,876
Okay.

632
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:26,843
Damn it, they really must have been moving.

633
00:37:26,876 --> 00:37:28,110
CTU's here already.

634
00:37:28,143 --> 00:37:29,843
Listen to me. This is really important.

635
00:37:29,876 --> 00:37:31,609
Vladimir attacked you, and you defended yourself.

636
00:37:31,643 --> 00:37:32,943
That's what happened.

637
00:37:32,976 --> 00:37:34,110
I don't know.

638
00:37:34,143 --> 00:37:35,376
I do, and if anybody else

639
00:37:35,409 --> 00:37:36,943
wants to ask you questions about that,

640
00:37:36,976 --> 00:37:39,010
I'll be right there with you to answer them.

641
00:37:39,043 --> 00:37:42,177
Okay.

642
00:37:42,209 --> 00:37:44,376
Let me go talk to them.

643
00:38:05,443 --> 00:38:06,843
They're Russian.

644
00:38:06,876 --> 00:38:09,077
Vladimir must have contacted whoever's got the rods.

645
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:11,077
They just didn't want him to know.

646
00:38:14,409 --> 00:38:16,476
Hold on to this.

647
00:38:16,509 --> 00:38:18,309
What are you doing?

648
00:38:18,342 --> 00:38:19,943
I need to let them take me.

649
00:38:19,976 --> 00:38:22,010
No. We have to get out of here.

650
00:38:23,509 --> 00:38:24,710
Listen to me.

651
00:38:24,743 --> 00:38:26,843
You want everything you've done so far to matter?

652
00:38:26,876 --> 00:38:27,910
I need to do this.

653
00:38:27,943 --> 00:38:28,910
When CTU gets here, you tell them

654
00:38:28,943 --> 00:38:30,077
to start tracking me from the air.

655
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:31,242
These people are gonna lead us

656
00:38:31,276 --> 00:38:32,409
to everything we're looking for.

657
00:38:32,443 --> 00:38:33,643
They will kill you.

658
00:38:33,676 --> 00:38:36,010
No. At worst, they're going to have to vet me,

659
00:38:36,043 --> 00:38:37,443
find out how much I know.

660
00:38:37,476 --> 00:38:38,943
It should buy us enough time.

661
00:38:43,043 --> 00:38:44,409
Hide in here.

662
00:38:45,609 --> 00:38:47,876
Take this.

663
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:50,177
If this door opens again, you start shooting.

664
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:06,643
Don't shoot!

665
00:39:06,676 --> 00:39:07,810
Please!

666
00:39:07,843 --> 00:39:09,110
I'm opening the door.

667
00:39:09,143 --> 00:39:10,110
I'm unarmed.

668
00:39:10,143 --> 00:39:11,876
See? Both my hands.

669
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:13,676
See? No problem.

670
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:14,843
I'm unarmed.

671
00:39:14,876 --> 00:39:16,043
Don't shoot.

672
00:39:16,077 --> 00:39:18,242
What happened here?

673
00:39:18,276 --> 00:39:20,609
What happened?!

674
00:39:20,643 --> 00:39:21,910
They tried to rip me off.

675
00:39:21,943 --> 00:39:24,342
But you and I-- we can do business. Wait! Wait!

676
00:39:24,342 --> 00:39:25,476
No! Don'

677
00:39:27,443 --> 00:39:30,276
If you kill me, you're gonna cost your boss a lot of money.

678
00:39:31,342 --> 00:39:33,342
Who else is with you here?

679
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:35,843
No one. Everybody else is dead.

680
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:40,443
All I want to do is business.

681
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:20,810
Mikhail!

682
00:40:21,003 --> 00:40:21,833
Ó²

683
00:40:22,321 --> 00:40:23,677
Ó²

684
00:41:28,943 --> 00:41:30,943
Hansen, upload to CTU.

685
00:41:30,976 --> 00:41:33,743
Mr. Hastings,

686
00:41:33,776 --> 00:41:34,910
site is secured.

687
00:41:34,943 --> 00:41:36,110
Video's coming through.

688
00:41:36,143 --> 00:41:37,743
Three bodies. Are you getting this?

689
00:41:37,776 --> 00:41:39,077
Yes, we are.

690
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:40,476
Any sign of Jack or Renee?

691
00:41:40,509 --> 00:41:41,643
No, sir.

692
00:41:41,676 --> 00:41:42,776
I'm here.

693
00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:46,476
Here.

694
00:41:46,509 --> 00:41:48,143
It's Renee, sir. She's alive.

695
00:41:48,177 --> 00:41:51,776
Renee, where's Jack?

696
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:54,543
The Russians took him.

697
00:41:54,576 --> 00:41:56,576
The ones that have the nuclear materials.

698
00:41:56,609 --> 00:41:58,910
How? We've been monitoring the building.

699
00:41:58,943 --> 00:42:00,276
No vehicles left this area.

700
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:01,743
I don't... I don't know.

701
00:42:01,776 --> 00:42:03,743
They just suddenly appeared, but...

702
00:42:03,776 --> 00:42:05,077
Wait. Jack let himself be taken.

703
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:07,710
He said that you'd be monitoring him from the air.

704
00:42:08,743 --> 00:42:11,476
We haven't seen anything.

705
00:42:11,509 --> 00:42:13,976
Our drones have been overhead the whole time.

706
00:42:14,010 --> 00:42:15,309
They saw nothing.

707
00:42:15,342 --> 00:42:16,710
Where is he?

708
00:42:18,943 --> 00:42:20,609
Where is he?

709
00:42:20,643 --> 00:42:22,342
We don't know.

710
00:42:22,376 --> 00:42:24,409
We don't know.

711
00:42:42,443 --> 00:42:44,443
Step up.

712
00:42:44,444 --> 00:42:51,444
