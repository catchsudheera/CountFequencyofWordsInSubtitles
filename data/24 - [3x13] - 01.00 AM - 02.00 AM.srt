1
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,285
David, I still believe in your presidency,

2
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:21,359
and if Milliken threatens your ability
to lead this country, he will be stopped.

3
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,195
Milliken was driving the car
that killed your daughter 12 years ago.

4
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,680
Yeah. I saw Milliken driving the car that night.

5
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:31,237
Kelly was the only one who saw it,
then Milliken got to him.

6
00:00:31,272 --> 00:00:32,633
<i>- He'll swear to this?
- Yes.</i>

7
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,592
Mr Kelly?

8
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,233
<i>-  What is that?
- A baby.</i>

9
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,375
I can see that it's a baby. Whose is it?

10
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:43,231
- Chloe's.
- Chloe doesn't have a baby.

11
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,995
Adam just told me you're not the mother.

12
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,285
I think she's delusional.

13
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:50,630
She's the only one capable
of filtering Chase's audio strains.

14
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:55,277
- If Chloe is unstable...
- We've no alternative. We've got to keep her.

15
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,358
Amador will be here in 15 minutes.

16
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,877
Confirm that he has the virus, give him
his money and bring the virus back to us.

17
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,285
Good job. I don't need you any more.

18
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,709
He's gonna kill him.
Delta teams won't get there.

19
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:10,154
<i>Ram√≥n, we had a deal.</i>

20
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,792
<i>- Chase!
-  Tony, Delta's here.</i>

21
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:19,710
All we want is the virus.
Just put the cylinder down slowly.

22
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:26,915
We do not have the virus.
The cylinder was rigged with a bomb.

23
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,229
<i>Amador switched it. Do we have his position?</i>

24
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,880
<i> Delta has a team on him.
He won't get far.</i>

25
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,198
<i> Hands in the air. Get on the ground.</i>

26
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,714
<i> Amador ambushed Delta Three.
It was a setup.</i>

27
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,918
<i>-  What about his position?
- We lost his signal.</i>

28
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:47,511
Son of a bitch. Delta Three's been taken out.
They don't have a position on Amador.

29
00:01:47,546 --> 00:01:49,390
- What do you wanna do?
- We gotta find Nina.

30
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,885
- Jack.
- This is Bauer.

31
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,920
- I have an area lit past the road. Is that you?
- Negative.

32
00:02:26,955 --> 00:02:29,753
<i>- I'll check it out.
- Be careful.</i>

33
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,917
<i> Stop right there.</i>

34
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,792
Drop your gun.

35
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,355
Drop it! Put your hands on your head.

36
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,195
- You on a two-way with Jack?
- Yeah.

37
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,515
Give him a code six.

38
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,669
I'm gonna reach in my bag
and I'm gonna pull out a two-way.

39
00:03:22,704 --> 00:03:24,631
Slowly.

40
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,205
Jack?

41
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,231
- Yeah?
- Code six.

42
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,393
What about the light you saw?

43
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,990
It was nothing.

44
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,071
Off, not standby. Throw it over here.

45
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,405
- Who is on the grid?
- Just me and Jack.

46
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,440
- You're lying. I saw a Delta team.
- They went north.

47
00:03:57,475 --> 00:04:01,956
- What about Amador?
- He escaped with the virus.

48
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,959
He ripped off everybody.

49
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,605
Son of a bitch.

50
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,552
All right. Move down the hill.

51
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,757
- Where are we going?
- Just walk.

52
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,914
- You OK?
- Yeah.

53
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:21,113
Contact Delta.
Tell them to meet us at the airfield.

54
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,715
- What are you gonna do?
- Interrogate her.

55
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,400
- No, he's not.
- Shut up!

56
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,832
Chase, please, just trust me.

57
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,874
I'll meet you at the airfield.

58
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:42,913
Jack, Amador still has the virus.
I can help you track him.

59
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,396
He chose here cos it's close to the border.
He needs to get back to LA.

60
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:50,189
Once he does, he'll meet somebody,
unload the virus and disappear.

61
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,005
I can help you find him.

62
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:56,556
Jack, I don't want to die.
Let me help you find him.

63
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:03,000
I can help you.

64
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,152
<i>- CTU.
- This is Bauer. Patch me through to Almeida.</i>

65
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,205
Almeida.

66
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:27,119
I've got Nina Myers. Alive.
Any sign of Amador?

67
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,405
No. Once the satellite comes around,
we'll do a sweep.

68
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:35,036
- Nina says he's headed to Los Angeles.
- Do you believe her?

69
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,279
I think she knows something. She wants to
cut a deal. We gotta bring her back to CTU.

70
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,829
OK. I'll get a Delta plane ready.

71
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,796
Copy that.

72
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,108
Get up. Slowly.

73
00:05:55,200 --> 00:06:01,070
Tony, I'm coordinating too many comms. I
need to off-load some of it to Adam's group.

74
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,391
- You have everything?
- Yeah.

75
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,836
Look, Chloe, uh...
you need to go talk to Chappelle.

76
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,911
For what?

77
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,595
You know what for.

78
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,436
- Kim Bauer.
- Did you update the logs?

79
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,109
Most of them.
What's going on with Dad and Chase?

80
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:32,990
That's why I called. They're headed back to
LA. They lost Amador. We're looking for him.

81
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,878
- What about Nina?
- They're bringing her with them.

82
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,958
- Thank you, Tony.
- All right. You got it.

83
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,765
I'd love nothing more,
but we have to prioritize.

84
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:55,830
<i>-  I understand. Keep me posted.
- All right. Yeah. All right. I gotta go.</i>

85
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,965
- Tony said you wanted to talk. Here I am.
- Sit down.

86
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,152
If you want me to talk about the baby, you're
wasting your time because I'm not gonna.

87
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,954
So sit down. Tell me what the hell's going on.

88
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,797
What?

89
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,510
All right. First you told us the baby
was yours. We found out that was a lie.

90
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:21,513
Then you say you and your boyfriend took it
from its mother because it was being abused.

91
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:26,196
I did say that and I'd like
to correct that right now.

92
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,514
I don't have a boyfriend.

93
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:32,198
You're unbelievable.

94
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,965
- Who does the baby belong to?
- I can't tell you.

95
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,675
You brought in an unauthorized person.
That's a federal offence.

96
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:45,216
- It's just a baby.
- I don't care who it is, you're in violation.

97
00:07:45,251 --> 00:07:50,233
- Fine. I'm in violation.
- Who does the baby belong to, Chloe?

98
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,873
Do you want me to take it to the lab
and run blood tests to get an ID? Cos I will.

99
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,565
I'm not gonna talk about this baby.
It's not because I'm an evil person.

100
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:06,197
It's just because I can't do it. Just
please don't start sticking needles in her.

101
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,765
<i>- Eileen?
- Yes, Mr Chappelle?</i>

102
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:18,191
Send security in. I want Chloe O'Brian under
guard while we run some tests on the baby.

103
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,670
<i>Right away, sir.</i>

104
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,365
Tony Almeida from CTU has just informed us

105
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:27,637
that they were unable to confiscate
this Cordilla virus in Mexico.

106
00:08:27,672 --> 00:08:31,875
I thought they located the seller
and had the area surrounded.

107
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:37,474
The seller, a man named Michael Amador,
he never intended to give up the virus.

108
00:08:37,509 --> 00:08:42,000
In fact, it was a well-planned rip-off.
David, we lost six men.

109
00:08:42,035 --> 00:08:44,150
Members of a Delta team.

110
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,153
We lost a Delta team?

111
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,165
This man, Amador, where is he now?

112
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,634
The theory is that Amador has this virus

113
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,589
- and is headed back here to LA.
- To release it?

114
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,275
We don't know, but he has no history
of implementing terrorist strikes.

115
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:01,158
He's an arms dealer with no known ideology.

116
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,352
The bottom line is
we just don't know what his intentions are.

117
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,517
I'm sorry to interrupt.
I finally reached Sherry Palmer.

118
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,072
- Is she on the line now?
- Yes, sir.

119
00:09:12,107 --> 00:09:14,958
Continue here, Wayne.

120
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,165
Sherry?

121
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,351
I'm sorry I couldn't call back.
I had to leave Kelly's in a hurry.

122
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:31,352
- Did you talk to him after we spoke?
- That's just it. When I got back, he was gone.

123
00:09:31,387 --> 00:09:34,165
<i>- Gone? Do you think he ran?
- No, I don't.</i>

124
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,476
He was more than ready
to come forward against Milliken.

125
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,365
- Someone obviously got to him first.
- But you didn't see anyone?

126
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:46,520
No. I ran back to my car and got out of there.
I was, uh... I was pretty there scared, David.

127
00:09:46,555 --> 00:09:51,000
Milliken must be on to you. Get back here.
It's not safe for you out there any more.

128
00:09:51,035 --> 00:09:53,965
I really need to do something first.

129
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,992
<i>- What?
- I've got to go see Julia Milliken.</i>

130
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,788
No. No. I don't want you to go
anywhere near her or Alan tonight.

131
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:06,797
I have to. Milliken had to move fast in order to
kidnap, maybe even kill, this Kevin Kelly guy.

132
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,237
I must take advantage of that
before he covers his tracks.

133
00:10:10,272 --> 00:10:12,395
Sherry, I do not want you confronting Alan.

134
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:16,434
I told you, David,
I'm just going to talk to Julia.

135
00:10:16,469 --> 00:10:18,839
I promise, I'll stay away from Alan.

136
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,952
- Sherry...
- David.

137
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,596
You asked me to help you, right?
Please, let me do that.

138
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,635
- What happened?
- She wants to help find Amador.

139
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:44,880
Agent Bauer? Mike Murphy, Delta Four. The
navy was good enough to reroute a C-130.

140
00:10:44,915 --> 00:10:49,192
- Tell them we said thank you.
- We're taking you and the prisoner to LA.

141
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,238
- Any movement on Amador?
- No.

142
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:54,711
Air Tactical's been monitoring the area.
So far, nothing.

143
00:10:54,746 --> 00:10:58,314
- Jack, you sure you want to leave?
- Secure her.

144
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,478
Amador's already gone.
He's planned this thing well.

145
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,355
We need to find who wants the virus
and where and when they're releasing it.

146
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:07,236
We need to leave.

147
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,245
<i>-  Hello.
- Marcus, it's me.</i>

148
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:36,076
- Where are you?
- I'll be there in an hour.

149
00:11:36,111 --> 00:11:39,873
- You got the virus?
- Yes. Just be ready.

150
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,559
I will be.

151
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,359
- Hello?
- Julia?

152
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,116
- I'm almost there. Where's Alan now?
- He's in his room.

153
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:20,317
- Is he asleep?
- No. He just got off the phone with someone.

154
00:12:20,352 --> 00:12:23,880
- Do you know who was he was talking to?
- No, no.

155
00:12:23,915 --> 00:12:26,997
How do I get to you without him knowing?

156
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,353
The gate code is 41-32.

157
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,468
Park off to the side and walk up
to the service porch. I'll be there.

158
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:39,395
- All right. What's that number again?
- 41-32.

159
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,045
<i>- OK. Are there any security cameras?
- Yes.</i>

160
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:46,080
- Make sure they're disabled.
- I don't know if I can.

161
00:12:46,115 --> 00:12:48,799
Find a way, Julia.

162
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:52,072
<i>I'll be there in a few minutes.</i>

163
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,271
You're up late.

164
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,714
Ken called from Singapore.

165
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:25,237
He still hasn't figured out
how to calculate the time difference.

166
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,845
- You should be in bed yourself.
- I will.

167
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:33,509
I just put on some tea.
I'd like to settle my stomach.

168
00:13:33,544 --> 00:13:36,711
- All right, then.
- All right.

169
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,640
- Good night.
- Good night.

170
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,999
Julia?

171
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:56,272
I know you felt demeaned earlier.

172
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,953
That's behind us now.

173
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,271
I know it is.

174
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,992
I let you live. Tell me what you know.

175
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:35,916
When Amador does business on the West
Coast, he washes his deal through Alvers.

176
00:14:35,951 --> 00:14:37,989
Alvers. What's his first name?

177
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,160
All I is know "Alvers".

178
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,165
- How does Amador contact this Alvers?
- I don't know. I've never met him.

179
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:49,671
But I did check out Amador before our deal
and I kept coming across the name "Alvers".

180
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,199
It was a connector to a lot of his past deals
and Los Angeles was always the hub.

181
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,789
- Chase, you on with CTU?
- Yeah, it's Tony.

182
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:01,952
- Tell him I want to speak to him.
- Tony, Jack wants to talk to you.

183
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,879
- Tony.
- Hey, Jack.

184
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:10,796
I want you to run a check on the name
"Alvers". Cross-reference it with Amador.

185
00:15:10,831 --> 00:15:14,678
- Is that it?
- Yeah. Just the name - "Alvers". A-l-v-e-r-s.

186
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,965
<i>- You got this from Nina?
- Yeah.</i>

187
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,437
- All right. I'll work it up. I'll get back to you.
- OK. Thanks.

188
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,350
Keep it.

189
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,765
- How's the hand?
- Don't worry about it. It's fine.

190
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:43,679
You and I have been through a lot today.
We should move past it and do our job.

191
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,073
You don't trust me, Jack. Why didn't
you tell me about your deal with Hector?

192
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,165
It couldn't go beyond Gael, Tony and myself.

193
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:56,115
What did you think? That I wasn't
going to come after you and Ram√≥n?

194
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:02,072
- I didn't know whether to save or kill you.
- I expected you to follow my orders.

195
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,553
But I probably would've
done the same thing myself.

196
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,633
You put a gun to my head.
And you pulled the trigger.

197
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:14,351
I made a judgment call that Salazar would not
give me a loaded weapon, that it was a test.

198
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,353
And if it was loaded?

199
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,751
- Then what?
- I'd have finished my mission.

200
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,590
You do this job long enough,
you're gonna have to make choices,

201
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,365
and you don't know you've made
the right one until the scenario plays out.

202
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:32,996
The only thing that matters is that if we don't
stop this virus, the world will change forever.

203
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,111
And that fact alone

204
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:41,038
is the only thing that you have to keep
in the front of your mind, and you know that.

205
00:16:41,073 --> 00:16:43,798
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

206
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,237
Keep pressing her.
She probably hasn't told you everything.

207
00:16:48,272 --> 00:16:50,156
No, she probably hasn't.

208
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:55,799
But we're gonna have to wait.
Make sure Alvers is a real lead.

209
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,039
Over a 1,000 "Alvers"
showed up in the database.

210
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,678
I did background checks and consistency refs
with Amador. Only one red-flagged.

211
00:17:08,713 --> 00:17:11,478
Marcus Alvers.
Born in Austria. Moved to England.

212
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,797
Met Amador in Cambridge,
where Alvers studied biology.

213
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:19,273
In 1994 they were suspected
of manufacturing weapons-grade anthrax.

214
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,765
- But there was no evidence.
- Sounds like our guy.

215
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:25,759
The dossier's sketchy, but they've
definitely crossed paths over the years.

216
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,365
The CIA had these on file.

217
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,916
Over the past three years there have been 14
sightings of Alvers and Amador together.

218
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,873
All right. So, how do we find Alvers?

219
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:39,397
We have some threads.
We'll need manpower from Division.

220
00:17:39,432 --> 00:17:41,156
Michelle, hook 'em up.

221
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,870
- Bauer.
- We got a match on Alvers.

222
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,215
Now we gotta find him. It'll take some time.

223
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:58,230
Yeah. I'll see what we can do from here.

224
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,277
We're on.

225
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,875
Looks like the information
you gave us is real.

226
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,710
Of course it is. CTU's not going to
find him before his meeting with Amador.

227
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,565
- But I can help you.
- How?

228
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,989
I know a little more than I said I did.

229
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,434
I know there's no time for a signed deal,

230
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,755
so I'm gonna trust you'll support my case
with the Department of Justice if I help you.

231
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,756
You've got my word.

232
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:30,030
His name is Marcus Frederick Alvers. He's
an amateur biologist and wannabe terrorist.

233
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:34,796
Raised hell from Vienna to Los Angeles,
with a two-year stop in London.

234
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,512
I have a number for him.

235
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,190
Dial a Felco prefix, then you reach him
through an internet socket.

236
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,993
Give me the cold line.

237
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,676
What's the number?

238
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:57,430
It's 1775531.

239
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:01,315
You're gonna get a fast busy signal,
but don't hang up.

240
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:07,077
- I've got the busy signal.
- Hit nine and hold it for three seconds.

241
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,956
- Did you get a tone?
- Yeah, I've got a tone.

242
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,871
Hit 95731-star-6.

243
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,392
It's ringing.

244
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:32,516
When the ringing stops, you're gonna get
a series of numbers. That's your IP address.

245
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,312
It's stopped ringing.

246
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:42,391
- I'm not getting any numbers.
- It's OK. Just wait.

247
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,434
<i>Yeah?</i>

248
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:59,151
The tech room is spiking all over the place.
Can you reset it?

249
00:19:59,186 --> 00:20:01,275
I don't know. I'll have to get back to you.

250
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:04,630
Adam, what's going on? My system's locked.

251
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,885
<i>- Division. Tech.
- It's Adam in CTU.</i>

252
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:13,870
<i>Adam, look, we don't know what's going on.
We're locked up here too. I'll get back to you.</i>

253
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,713
- No need to dial it again. Once was enough.
- What are you talking about?

254
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:28,790
You just triggered a worm that's going
to bring down agency connectivity.

255
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:33,311
My God, what have you done?
What have you done?

256
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:37,793
Until I say otherwise, your anti terrorist
computer network is jammed.

257
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,885
We got a self-propagating code
leaking into the system.

258
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:45,914
Shut down your sockets. Save everything
you can. We gotta find where this came from.

259
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:08,629
<i>-  Nina did this?
- She knew our system better than anyone.</i>

260
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,078
She embedded a worm where
she knew we'd never upgrade.

261
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,873
She told you this? What does she want?

262
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:19,272
- I don't know. Can you stop this thing?
- We're doing our best, Jack.

263
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,617
Pull Chloe out of my sector.

264
00:21:21,652 --> 00:21:23,915
She's been asked to step aside.

265
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,873
<i>- What are you talking about?
- It's a long story.</i>

266
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,156
This is not the time to take Chloe out of play.

267
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:33,035
You know how many terrorist cells
try to hack into our system.

268
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,979
If this eats through our fire walls,
agents will be targets.

269
00:21:36,014 --> 00:21:38,839
What about Nina?
Will she tell us how to neutralize this?

270
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:43,910
<i>- I'll start working on it. I'll get back to you.
- All right.</i>

271
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:47,117
- What do you want?
- Turn around and head back to Mexico.

272
00:21:47,152 --> 00:21:49,798
Once you do, I'll slow down
the spread of the worm.

273
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:53,037
- When I'm safe, I'll give you the kill code.
- That'll never happen.

274
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:57,085
How many terrorist cells are waiting
for a window like this? 200?

275
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:02,638
In 30 minutes they'll all have access to CTU
files everywhere. Turn the plane around.

276
00:22:02,673 --> 00:22:07,753
- You're assuming we can't stop this thing.
- I invite you to try.

277
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,269
Ryan, I know.

278
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:21,872
But Chloe's the only one who knows enough
about this section of code to stop the worm.

279
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:26,233
- Fine. Steve, you can go.
- Yes, sir.

280
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,485
- What's happening?
- There's a worm in our network.

281
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,910
Nina Myers somehow launched it remotely
and it's running rampant.

282
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,475
Tony says you can stop it. Is that correct?

283
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,957
- If it hasn't destroyed the routing data.
- Good. Do it.

284
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,511
- Did you close the gateways?
- Yeah.

285
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,685
- Reopen 12 and 14.
- What for?

286
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,915
They won't leak
and they get us to the kernel.

287
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:58,910
Dalton, ping the nodes in IT. If you stop
getting packet loss, freeze the process.

288
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,912
- I'll be in the tech room.
- All right.

289
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:40,073
I'm not comfortable with you being here,
so just tell me what you want.

290
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:45,309
Come on, Julia, I told you earlier. I know
about your marriage, I know about your life.

291
00:24:45,344 --> 00:24:47,355
I know you'd rather be with a man you love,

292
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:50,996
but you stay with Alan
because of his money and the security.

293
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:54,948
I don't need a drive-through shrink,
so unless you have a real reason to be...

294
00:24:54,983 --> 00:24:57,115
How about murder?

295
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,632
What are you talking about?

296
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:05,629
A man named Kevin Kelly has information
on Alan that could hurt him very badly.

297
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,925
An hour ago, Kelly disappeared.

298
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,599
- Disappeared?
- It's possible he was killed.

299
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:14,873
- And you think Alan is involved?
- Sweetie, I know Alan is involved.

300
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,560
And you're gonna help me prove it.

301
00:25:17,595 --> 00:25:20,154
Even if I could do that, why would I?

302
00:25:20,189 --> 00:25:22,713
Because it's your ticket out of here.

303
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,919
If Alan goes to prison,
you get everything, Julia.

304
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,749
What would you need me to do?

305
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:40,960
First, I need you to find out what phone
calls he's made in the past two hours.

306
00:25:40,995 --> 00:25:44,635
- He makes his calls behind closed doors.
- Does he use the house phone?

307
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:49,073
His cell. He keeps it with him.
It makes things easier with his wheelchair.

308
00:25:49,108 --> 00:25:52,116
- Where's his cellphone now?
- In his room.

309
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:54,430
- I need you to get that phone.
- No.

310
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:57,433
Alan just went to bed.
I'm not sure he's asleep yet.

311
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,274
Well, then, why don't you find out?

312
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:01,925
I can't.

313
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,190
Don't you want to be free of him?

314
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:09,357
- I'm afraid.
- Well, I'm not.

315
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,716
Where's the bedroom?

316
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:22,396
Set the group permission on the beta node
to 577 and make it recursive down the tree.

317
00:27:22,431 --> 00:27:26,200
I want anyone who's on the cipher volume
to stay off until I'm done.

318
00:27:26,235 --> 00:27:28,634
- Adam, are those gateways open?
- Of course.

319
00:27:28,669 --> 00:27:30,965
I'm trying to see the virus definition.

320
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,197
- I hope you have enough to go on.
- We'll know in a minute.

321
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:39,276
It's sad that I have to do this knowing
that you and Kim stabbed me in the back.

322
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:43,791
What do you want me to do? You're breaking
rules and lying about it all the place.

323
00:27:43,826 --> 00:27:46,910
- Tell me what you'd do.
- I'd have faith in my fellow worker.

324
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,365
No, you'd follow protocol.
You're the biggest rule freak of anyone.

325
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:55,837
I've done a good job at breaking the rules,
trying to protect a friend and that baby.

326
00:27:55,872 --> 00:27:57,955
What friend?

327
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,765
It's done. Dammit.

328
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,870
- It didn't work?
- The worm's speeding up!

329
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,165
- How is that possible?
- We triggered something. Open 1 and 4.

330
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:13,228
- Won't that expose the kernel?
- Yeah, but we have no choice. Do it.

331
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,795
<i>-  07?
- No. 47.</i>

332
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,231
Yes. And the last one on here
has a 206 area code.

333
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:29,200
<i>- Washington?
- Yeah. That's 555-0191.</i>

334
00:28:29,235 --> 00:28:30,965
<i>- That's it?
- Yeah.</i>

335
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,878
OK. And, Brian? Thank you so much.

336
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,200
<i>- You OK?
- Yeah. Just call me. All right.</i>

337
00:28:38,235 --> 00:28:39,349
What are you doing?

338
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:42,392
I have someone who can track
the calls made from this phone.

339
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:47,110
If any of them can be connected to Kelly, we
have evidence that we can use against Alan.

340
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,165
- What should I do?
- Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

341
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:55,877
Just go to bed and, as far as you're
concerned, nothing happened here.

342
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:01,393
Julia. Why aren't you in bed?
And who are you talking to?

343
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,311
Sherry?

344
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,995
Hello, Alan.

345
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:11,829
- Julia, I'm disappointed in you.
- I didn't ask her here.

346
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:15,400
But you let her in
and you took my cellphone as well.

347
00:29:15,435 --> 00:29:17,072
No.

348
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,191
I took the phone.

349
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,950
So, what do you think you're going to do,
Sherry? Stop me? That's not likely.

350
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,765
All right.

351
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:33,429
You want to talk about this in the open? Fine.

352
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:37,558
What happened to Kevin Kelly?

353
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:42,273
- Kevin Kelly. The name rings a bell.
- Well, it should ring a bell.

354
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:46,473
He's the man that saw you run over
his daughter and kill her 12 years ago.

355
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:50,673
The man you paid a considerable amount
of money to keep quiet.

356
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:53,737
And the man you made disappear tonight.

357
00:29:53,772 --> 00:29:56,675
So, why don't you chew on that a bit?

358
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:00,790
And maybe we can talk about it
a little more tomorrow.

359
00:30:00,825 --> 00:30:05,030
Or we can end it now
and you can back off David.

360
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,871
<i>- Bauer.
-  Chloe O'Brian for you.</i>

361
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:20,317
<i>- Fine. Patch her through.
- Yes, sir.</i>

362
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:25,990
<i> I understand the system's going down.</i>

363
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:29,989
Have you tried all the security codes?

364
00:30:30,024 --> 00:30:32,245
What do you suggest?

365
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,045
Nina, I've heard all about you.

366
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,868
I know what you've done,
and how you've stayed alive is impressive.

367
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:43,673
But if you try to play Jack one more time...
he's going to kill you.

368
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,911
Is that so?

369
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,999
Yeah.

370
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,190
I'm going to put you on speakerphone.

371
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,845
In three minutes our system will be down.

372
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,952
If you want any leverage,
tell me how to stop this thing now.

373
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:10,951
- It doesn't move that fast.
- You're wrong. Chloe, put it up on the screen.

374
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:15,429
<i>You're running out of time to cut a deal.
Explain it to her, Chloe.</i>

375
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:18,438
When I tried to separate the routers,
the worm speed tripled.

376
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,645
<i>- Who is this?
- Chloe O'Brian.</i>

377
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:22,717
My network monitor's up. What do I do?

378
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:29,431
Log in with user ID: CIS 27 A.

379
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:33,514
- It's asking for a security level.
- Hit Escape 6.

380
00:31:33,549 --> 00:31:35,436
<i>- That's it?
- Yes.</i>

381
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:38,235
<i>-  Chloe, did that stop it?
- No.</i>

382
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:41,352
Wait a minute.
It didn't stop, but it's slowing down.

383
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:44,997
<i>- How much time do we have?
- Our simulation says 20 minutes.</i>

384
00:31:45,032 --> 00:31:47,599
- I'll get back to you.
- OK, I slowed it down.

385
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:50,245
Now turn around and head back to Mexico.

386
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:54,432
If you don't, you can expect your undercover
agents to start dying within the hour.

387
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:58,155
You're going to LA. You're gonna help me
find Amador and then go to prison.

388
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:01,638
That's what's happening here.

389
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:08,495
You come into my house
after everything I've done for your family?

390
00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:11,911
I made your children's father
the president of the United States!

391
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:17,274
Wait a minute. Whatever you did to help
David was not for the benefit of my children.

392
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:22,435
You're just a small man, who lords his money
over his friends because that's all you have.

393
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:26,553
That's all you are. Why do you think your wife
had to go out and find another man?

394
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:29,045
- Don't talk to me like this.
- Because you're not one!

395
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:34,200
Not one woman in her right mind would
find you attractive without your wealth, Alan.

396
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:38,045
That's what people want from you.
That's all Julia wants from you.

397
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:42,995
I'm supposed to be afraid of you? You think
I'm scared of you? You're just a little boy.

398
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:46,295
A pathetic, scrawny, sickly little boy.

399
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:49,111
<i> Julia! My pills, my pills.</i>

400
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,518
- Don't.
- What are you doing?

401
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,159
- Don't.
- Sherry?

402
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,789
<i>- Don't.
-  Julia. Julia.</i>

403
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,871
This is your way out.

404
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,674
Julia!

405
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,632
Julia!

406
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,635
Julia! Julia!

407
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,749
All right. We can't stay here, Julia.

408
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:47,477
- We killed him.
- No, no. No one killed him.

409
00:33:47,512 --> 00:33:50,115
- We watched him die.
- It's over, Julia.

410
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,834
- We watched him!
- It's over! Shh!

411
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:59,670
Now, Alan was a sick little man
and his weak body gave out.

412
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:04,072
Nobody was around to help him and
you were in your bedroom. Understand me?

413
00:34:04,107 --> 00:34:08,033
You're free of him, sweetie.
That's all you need to think about.

414
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:11,152
But there's one thing
you're gonna have to be clear about

415
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:14,516
when the authorities
come around questioning you.

416
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,396
This was an accident.

417
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:23,792
- I don't think I can do this.
- You don't have a choice.

418
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:28,038
Unless you want to spend
the rest of your pretty little life in prison.

419
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,312
Oh, God.

420
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:35,912
All right. You go into your bedroom.
You stay there for about an hour.

421
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:39,113
Then you're gonna come out
for a glass of water,

422
00:34:39,148 --> 00:34:41,593
and then you're gonna see the body.

423
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,873
Now, that's your story.

424
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,076
Who do I call?

425
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,805
911.

426
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:56,752
That's what you would naturally do, right?

427
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,159
OK.

428
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,710
- What about you?
- No, no. You listen.

429
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:04,005
You listen real strong
because this is very crucial.

430
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:09,398
If anyone suspects that I was here,
there will be an investigation,

431
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,557
and both of us will go to prison.

432
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,996
I was never here.

433
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,510
You understand me?

434
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:28,991
Julia, you tell me right now
that you understand what I'm saying.

435
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,679
I understand.

436
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,553
OK.

437
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,459
Stop that process. It's making it worse.

438
00:35:55,494 --> 00:35:57,438
- What is it?
- I'm not getting it.

439
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,477
- What'll it take?
- I don't know.

440
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:03,359
If you can't stop this worm,
I have to tell Jack to reroute that plane.

441
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,636
Tony, please let me work.

442
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,645
<i>- Bauer.
- Jack.</i>

443
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:13,434
- Tell me you've got a handle on this thing.
- We don't.

444
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:18,295
Nina's not gonna give us the kill code until
we turn the plane around back to Mexico.

445
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:22,710
We don't have a choice. Tell the pilot to
reroute now. We have to do whatever it takes.

446
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:26,475
<i>That's not an alternative. Tony? Tony?</i>

447
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,789
Son of a bitch.

448
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:32,839
Once the damage is done, you won't be able
to cut a deal. Give me the kill code.

449
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:35,036
Jack.

450
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:44,552
Think about it.
You should give her what she wants now.

451
00:36:44,587 --> 00:36:46,845
It's not worth it.
We'll deal with her later.

452
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:50,429
If you turn the plane around,
I can slow this thing down even more.

453
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:54,390
But I'm not giving you the kill code
until I'm safe in Mexico.

454
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,871
- What's going on?
- We're going back up.

455
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:00,510
Son of a bitch.

456
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,676
- What are you doing?
- I got orders from Almeida not to land.

457
00:37:06,711 --> 00:37:09,672
- He said to take the plane to Mexico.
- Land the plane now.

458
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,875
I got my orders.

459
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:16,838
Don't even think about it.
Land the plane!

460
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:20,389
What the hell is he doing?

461
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,098
Lieutenant, why aren't you turning around?

462
00:37:25,133 --> 00:37:27,316
- Bauer won't let me.
- What do you mean?

463
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,990
<i>- He's got a gun on me.
- Put me on speaker.</i>

464
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:35,714
- Jack, can you hear me?
- Yeah, and we're landing in Los Angeles.

465
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:40,198
We need that kill code. Tell the pilot
to turn around. That's an order from Division.

466
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:43,845
- We can't keep giving in to her.
- Wait. I think I'm getting something.

467
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:47,873
I can't take that chance. We have to stop this
or agents are gonna wind up dead.

468
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:52,039
- Our people are gonna have to stop it.
- We're trying. We don't have the time.

469
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:55,880
Turning around won't help. It'll take us
farther from where we need to be.

470
00:37:55,915 --> 00:37:58,758
- Chloe.
- Please shut up. Dalton, bring it back to 50.

471
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,235
- OK. I'm clear.
- What branches?

472
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,045
- 14 through 20.
- Dalton?

473
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,878
- Yeah. The routers are coming back up.
- Are we OK?

474
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:09,231
- I can't tell.
- Yeah. Here, here. It's coming back up.

475
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:15,197
- No, stop the process.
- It's cycling through. It's almost back up.

476
00:38:15,232 --> 00:38:18,914
It's a defensive ploy built into the worm.
It's a simple back-pop virus.

477
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:22,750
- I've tripped out the resource fork.
- The CPU is almost 100 per cent.

478
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:27,317
- Stop. What you see on the monitor isn't real.
- Do what she says.

479
00:38:27,352 --> 00:38:29,719
All right. It's stopped.

480
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:35,873
- Wait. What's going on?
- I think it's resetting itself.

481
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,910
We got it.

482
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,632
Jack? We're back up.

483
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:50,910
- Fully functional?
- Fully functional.

484
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:54,914
We're resuming our approach. Good work.

485
00:38:55,880 --> 00:39:00,431
You can file a report
with your commanding officer.

486
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,240
All our systems are up and running.

487
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:16,245
I don't believe you.

488
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,840
I don't care what you believe.

489
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:40,836
- Check your directories.
- I'm on it. What about the network volumes?

490
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:45,192
Let's remount those six at a time
until they're all on.

491
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:48,232
- OK. These all look good. Dalton?
- There's some drop-out.

492
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,595
But it'll self-adjust in ten minutes.

493
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:53,950
Great work today. You averted
what could have been a major loss.

494
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:58,472
- I know. Are Jack and Chase back soon?
- Yeah. Where are you going?

495
00:39:58,507 --> 00:40:01,352
- Back upstairs.
- No.

496
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:05,669
This whole thing with the baby
isn't going to just go away.

497
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:10,392
What you did will certainly bear well
on your case, but the charges still stand.

498
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:13,432
We're handing you over to LAPD
and, no matter what happens,

499
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,273
you'll have to tell them
who this baby belongs to.

500
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:21,036
- Where are they taking Angela?
- Child Protective Services has custody now.

501
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:23,435
- No, they can't do that.
- Of course they can.

502
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:27,240
- Child Services, hold on!
- What are you doing?

503
00:40:27,275 --> 00:40:29,276
I'll tell you who the father is.

504
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:41,189
Don't ask me who the mother is, I don't know.
I was doing a Unauthorized. I swear it's the truth.

505
00:40:41,224 --> 00:40:42,268
Barb.

506
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:48,233
We're gonna hold on to her a little longer.
We just got some more information.

507
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,005
Why didn't you tell me this earlier?

508
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:55,637
He didn't want me to tell anyone.
I was trying to be a friend. Sorry.

509
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,605
Chloe. I heard you stopped the worm.

510
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:05,712
Yeah. Your dad and Chase are back in LA.
You must be relieved.

511
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:09,059
Yes. Thank you.
Look, Chloe, what about the baby?

512
00:41:09,094 --> 00:41:11,879
- What?
- I thought they were pressing charges.

513
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:15,232
- No. That was a misunderstanding.
- Chloe, wait.

514
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,515
- What?
- So, they're not pressing charges?

515
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,949
- No.
- Why not?

516
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:22,998
I told them who the father was
and everything's OK.

517
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:26,237
Everything's OK? Why?
Who's the father?

518
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,996
Chase.
