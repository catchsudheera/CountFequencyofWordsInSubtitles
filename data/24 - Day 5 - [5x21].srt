1
00:00:14,932 --> 00:00:19,005
<i>We'll release the Sentox here
and 200,000 people die.</i>

2
00:00:19,091 --> 00:00:21,730
We need access to the control room.

3
00:00:21,811 --> 00:00:24,405
<i>Jack, Bierko will be ready
to deploy any minute.</i>

4
00:00:30,012 --> 00:00:34,004
<i>If we ignite that gas before it leaves
the plant, the Sentox will be incinerated.</i>

5
00:00:34,091 --> 00:00:35,843
Bierko!

6
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:44,883
Give me a hand.

7
00:00:44,971 --> 00:00:47,723
Organise an escort team.
You get him back to CTU alive.

8
00:00:47,811 --> 00:00:49,005
You got it.

9
00:00:49,091 --> 00:00:53,403
I just got word from the FAA
about a hijacking aboard a diplomatic flight.

10
00:00:53,491 --> 00:00:56,129
- So what?
- Jack Bauer is the hijacker.

11
00:00:56,211 --> 00:00:57,405
<i>What is he doing on that flight?</i>

12
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:01,563
He's looking for the recording
that implicates me in David Palmer's death.

13
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:05,848
Order the plane down
and grab Bauer before he can hurt us.

14
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:08,968
We need to take him down now, dead or alive.

15
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:12,130
- Mr. President.
- I don't care if Bauer is making threats.

16
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:15,759
That plane has to land immediately,
and when it lands,

17
00:01:15,849 --> 00:01:18,080
I want my Secret Service
detail to take him into custody.

18
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:20,685
- Sit down!
- He has a gun!

19
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:23,648
Everybody, stay in your seats
and no one will get hurt.

20
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:27,723
Captain, this is Jack Bauer.
I'm speaking to you on a discreet channel.

21
00:01:27,809 --> 00:01:30,961
The person that I'm looking for
is sitting next to you.

22
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:34,519
He's your copilot Scott Evans.
You need to open the door.

23
00:01:38,569 --> 00:01:41,083
Could you, uh... take the stick for a second?

24
00:01:45,849 --> 00:01:48,124
I'm the only one who can fly this plane.

25
00:01:49,889 --> 00:01:52,607
Give me the recording.

26
00:01:54,609 --> 00:01:58,317
Advise CTU I have the recording.
I'll be on the ground in less than 15 minutes.

27
00:01:58,408 --> 00:02:01,162
Bauer's got the evidence.
He is in control of the plane.

28
00:02:01,248 --> 00:02:04,923
<i>- What do we do?
- You have to shoot down that plane.</i>

29
00:02:05,008 --> 00:02:07,807
Otherwise you go to prison.

30
00:02:07,888 --> 00:02:10,277
<i>For treason and murder.</i>

31
00:02:22,728 --> 00:02:25,401
<i>Sierra Tango clear to flight level 220.</i>

32
00:02:25,488 --> 00:02:29,640
520 Sierra Tango, descend to flight level 220.

33
00:02:29,728 --> 00:02:32,878
- We can expect the approach to Van Nuys.
- Good.

34
00:02:32,967 --> 00:02:37,359
<i>- Can you patch me through to Karen Hayes?
- Hold, please.</i>

35
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:41,042
- You broke my nose.
- You'll get medical attention on the ground.

36
00:02:41,128 --> 00:02:43,880
Your only concern
should be flying this plane.

37
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:48,801
<i>- Jack Bauer on line one.
- Put him through.</i>

38
00:02:48,887 --> 00:02:51,799
<i>- You are connected.
- The recording was on the copilot.</i>

39
00:02:51,887 --> 00:02:54,720
- The copilot?
- Yeah. He was working for Henderson.

40
00:02:54,807 --> 00:02:57,718
I've secured the copilot.
We're en route back to Van Nuys.

41
00:02:57,807 --> 00:03:00,605
- What's our ETA?
- 21 minutes.

42
00:03:00,687 --> 00:03:03,246
We're gonna be on the ground
in 21 minutes. Listen.

43
00:03:03,327 --> 00:03:06,717
This recording proves Logan
was complicit in Palmer's murder.

44
00:03:06,807 --> 00:03:10,959
It is imperative we do not let it fall into
the hands of anyone loyal to the president.

45
00:03:11,047 --> 00:03:15,802
I'm gonna need you to provide me
with a safe corridor back to CTU.

46
00:03:15,886 --> 00:03:20,881
Jack, it's Bill. I'm here with Karen. We can
dispatch a team to meet you at the airfield.

47
00:03:20,966 --> 00:03:23,480
<i>They can take you into protective custody.</i>

48
00:03:23,566 --> 00:03:26,763
OK, good. Bill, how is Audrey?

49
00:03:26,846 --> 00:03:31,362
Curtis just brought her in. She's in Medical,
but it looks like she's going to be OK.

50
00:03:31,446 --> 00:03:35,564
Thank God. OK, I'll get back to you
as soon as we're on final approach.

51
00:03:35,645 --> 00:03:37,636
<i>All right.</i>

52
00:03:44,366 --> 00:03:47,118
I just got off the phone
with the county general.

53
00:03:47,205 --> 00:03:51,676
I have some great news.
Your father survived the crash.

54
00:03:51,766 --> 00:03:53,483
- He's alive?
- Yeah.

55
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:56,796
One of our teams picked him up
30 minutes ago at the accident site.

56
00:03:56,885 --> 00:03:59,718
He's still in ICU,
but they expect him to pull through.

57
00:03:59,805 --> 00:04:02,000
Oh, my God.

58
00:04:02,084 --> 00:04:06,795
We have a team stationed at the hospital.
He'll be well protected.

59
00:04:06,884 --> 00:04:10,082
Thank you.

60
00:04:10,165 --> 00:04:12,725
I have to take this.

61
00:04:12,804 --> 00:04:14,601
Curtis...

62
00:04:14,685 --> 00:04:17,676
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

63
00:04:17,764 --> 00:04:19,721
- Manning.
- Is Henderson secured?

64
00:04:19,804 --> 00:04:22,921
- He's in holding room three.
- I need you to pick up Jack.

65
00:04:23,004 --> 00:04:25,837
- Where is he?
- He's on a plane heading towards Van Nuys.

66
00:04:25,925 --> 00:04:28,392
- ETA is 20 minutes.
- Why is he on a plane?

67
00:04:28,484 --> 00:04:32,193
He had to commandeer the plane in order
to secure the evidence against Logan.

68
00:04:32,284 --> 00:04:34,195
I'll brief you en route.

69
00:04:34,284 --> 00:04:38,994
<i>I cannot emphasise strongly enough
the explosive nature of the evidence.</i>

70
00:04:39,084 --> 00:04:42,997
<i>I need you to put him into protective custody
and bring him back here to CTU.</i>

71
00:04:43,084 --> 00:04:46,679
- Understood.
- Logan will send his men to retrieve it.

72
00:04:46,764 --> 00:04:50,756
- You've got to get to Jack first.
- We will. I'm heading out.

73
00:04:53,604 --> 00:04:56,163
Yes?

74
00:04:56,244 --> 00:04:58,803
We have a solution
to allow the plane to be shot down.

75
00:04:58,883 --> 00:05:03,559
I sure as hell hope so. I may be the president,
but there are certain protocols in place.

76
00:05:03,643 --> 00:05:06,919
- This will circumvent your protocols.
- What is it?

77
00:05:07,003 --> 00:05:09,471
We're going to simulate a VCI distress signal.

78
00:05:09,563 --> 00:05:14,159
It will be broadcast on the plane's code,
and will appear to come from Bauer's flight.

79
00:05:14,242 --> 00:05:16,757
Hold on. What is a VCI distress signal?

80
00:05:16,842 --> 00:05:19,562
It indicates that there's
a hijacking in progress,

81
00:05:19,643 --> 00:05:22,077
and that the aircraft
is to be used as a weapon.

82
00:05:22,163 --> 00:05:24,438
It'll give you the pretext to shoot it down.

83
00:05:24,522 --> 00:05:28,038
<i>There really is no other
legitimate response to this scenario.</i>

84
00:05:28,122 --> 00:05:31,353
<i>All you need to do
is appear to struggle with the ethics,</i>

85
00:05:31,442 --> 00:05:33,831
<i>and then give the order.</i>

86
00:05:36,242 --> 00:05:38,631
<i>- Mr. President?
- Fine.</i>

87
00:05:40,082 --> 00:05:41,800
All right.

88
00:05:41,882 --> 00:05:44,476
You sound reluctant.

89
00:05:46,562 --> 00:05:49,360
I can't believe it's come to this.

90
00:05:49,442 --> 00:05:52,878
I'm going to shoot down
a plane full of innocent people.

91
00:05:52,962 --> 00:05:56,557
None of us is happy about this,
but you don't really have a choice.

92
00:05:56,641 --> 00:05:59,793
Bauer has evidence
implicating you in this conspiracy,

93
00:05:59,882 --> 00:06:05,878
and I don't have to tell you what
the consequences will be if it's released.

94
00:06:11,721 --> 00:06:16,841
We should contact Chloe and bring her in.
We'll want her help bringing Jack to CTU.

95
00:06:16,921 --> 00:06:18,991
Fine. Send an escort.

96
00:06:19,081 --> 00:06:24,360
Karen, I appreciate this. I know you're
putting everything on the line to help us.

97
00:06:24,441 --> 00:06:27,399
This recording better be
everything Jack claims it is.

98
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:33,077
I know Jack. I don't always agree
with his methods, but I trust his judgment.

99
00:06:34,161 --> 00:06:37,072
I'll go make that call.

100
00:06:37,161 --> 00:06:41,631
- What's Buchanan doing out of Holding?
- The situation changed. There's new intel.

101
00:06:41,721 --> 00:06:44,554
- What new intel?
- I don't have time to explain now.

102
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,279
- What?
- I'll brief you when I've got the chance.

103
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,920
Have you completed the orders
for Bierko's transfer?

104
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,869
- I'm still working on it.
- Let me know when you've got them.

105
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,558
What is it?

106
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:05,189
A situation has come up
regarding the hijacked plane.

107
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:10,114
- Tell me what's happening.
- The FAA picked up a VCI distress code.

108
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:14,795
- It originated from flight ST 520.
- What's a VCI distress code?

109
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:19,031
VCI is a coding system that was recently
installed in all commercial airliners.

110
00:07:19,119 --> 00:07:21,713
This code indicates a hijacking is underway,

111
00:07:21,799 --> 00:07:26,190
and that the plane is going to be used
to target installations on the ground.

112
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:31,637
- Oh, my God.
- Admiral Kirkland is on video conference.

113
00:07:31,719 --> 00:07:35,109
He's ready to brief you with the details.

114
00:07:40,119 --> 00:07:43,190
Admiral Kirkland, I'm Mike Novick.
I have the president here.

115
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:47,113
<i>- Mr. President.
- Mike's told me about this VCI signal.</i>

116
00:07:47,198 --> 00:07:49,792
How could that be sent
without Bauer's knowledge?

117
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:53,791
<i>Most likely one of the pilots secretly activated
the transponder code.</i>

118
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:57,268
At last report,
Bauer was in the passenger cabin.

119
00:07:57,358 --> 00:08:00,236
Does this mean that he's now in the cockpit?

120
00:08:00,318 --> 00:08:02,911
<i>It appears that way, sir.</i>

121
00:08:04,678 --> 00:08:08,830
<i>- What do we do, Admiral?
- The protocols are clearly specified.</i>

122
00:08:08,918 --> 00:08:11,512
<i>We're compelled to take pre-emptive action.</i>

123
00:08:11,597 --> 00:08:14,191
<i>- What action?
- The aircraft must be shot down.</i>

124
00:08:14,278 --> 00:08:16,712
<i>We've scrambled an F-18 out of Point Mugu.</i>

125
00:08:16,797 --> 00:08:20,073
<i>We just need your approval to engage.</i>

126
00:08:22,798 --> 00:08:25,470
There are over 50 people
on that plane, Admiral.

127
00:08:25,558 --> 00:08:30,233
<i>We have to think of the people on the ground.
Over 20 million citizens live in Los Angeles.</i>

128
00:08:30,317 --> 00:08:33,275
<i>Each one of them is now a potential target.</i>

129
00:08:33,357 --> 00:08:36,315
- I don't believe this.
- If I could interject.

130
00:08:36,397 --> 00:08:42,916
It's hard for me to accept Bauer intends to use
the aircraft as a weapon against civilians.

131
00:08:42,996 --> 00:08:47,751
<i>Jack Bauer is a distraught individual
with a history of erratic behaviour.</i>

132
00:08:47,836 --> 00:08:51,511
Jack Bauer has spent his entire career
protecting American lives.

133
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:56,113
<i>- There's a reason he's doing what he's doing.
- What would that be?</i>

134
00:08:56,196 --> 00:08:59,074
I don't have the answer,
but we should try to find out.

135
00:08:59,157 --> 00:09:04,514
<i>- We don't have the time.
- We could have the F-18 shadow the aircraft.</i>

136
00:09:04,596 --> 00:09:09,624
We could issue a standing order to fire only
if the target deviates from its present course.

137
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:12,389
<i>- It's not a viable option, Mr. President.
- Why not?</i>

138
00:09:12,475 --> 00:09:16,185
<i>The plane is over the desert.
In 15 minutes, it'll be above Los Angeles.</i>

139
00:09:16,276 --> 00:09:19,585
<i>If we shoot it down then,
there'll be massive casualties.</i>

140
00:09:19,676 --> 00:09:25,387
<i>We must consider the possibility that Bauer
intends to attack the presidential retreat.</i>

141
00:09:25,476 --> 00:09:28,069
<i>- The retreat?
- You're inside the target zone.</i>

142
00:09:28,155 --> 00:09:30,828
<i>Bauer has already been accused
of killing one president.</i>

143
00:09:30,915 --> 00:09:33,873
<i>The simple fact is
we don't know what his intentions are.</i>

144
00:09:33,955 --> 00:09:36,150
- Mr. President...
- Mike, stop.

145
00:09:36,715 --> 00:09:39,149
I've made my decision.

146
00:09:40,515 --> 00:09:43,075
I'm authorising you to shoot down that plane.

147
00:09:43,155 --> 00:09:44,588
<i>- Yes, sir.
- Mr. President...</i>

148
00:09:44,675 --> 00:09:47,143
Mike, please.

149
00:09:48,115 --> 00:09:52,267
Don't make this any more difficult for me
than it already is.

150
00:09:59,114 --> 00:10:03,505
Ms Hayes. This just came in
over the interagency subnet.

151
00:10:03,594 --> 00:10:06,472
What is it?

152
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:10,463
We have to alert Jack.

153
00:10:19,553 --> 00:10:20,702
This is Bauer.

154
00:10:20,793 --> 00:10:24,582
Air Traffic Control received
a VCI distress signal from your aircraft.

155
00:10:24,674 --> 00:10:28,985
- That authorises Logan to shoot you down.
- Shoot us down?

156
00:10:29,074 --> 00:10:32,669
An F-18's been scrambled out of Point Mugu.
You have eight to ten minutes.

157
00:10:32,753 --> 00:10:36,029
- Patch me through to the pilot of the F-18.
- No chance.

158
00:10:36,114 --> 00:10:39,264
It's a coded frequency.
I can get in touch with the White House.

159
00:10:39,353 --> 00:10:42,823
And tell them what? They don't want to hear
anything I have to say.

160
00:10:42,913 --> 00:10:46,508
- We need to land now.
- We're 100 miles from the nearest airport.

161
00:10:46,593 --> 00:10:49,824
They're going to shoot us down.
We need to get on the ground now.

162
00:10:49,913 --> 00:10:53,349
You didn't hear me. There's nowhere to land.

163
00:10:53,432 --> 00:10:56,708
- How much runway do you need?
- At least 5,000 feet.

164
00:10:56,793 --> 00:10:58,431
- Bill?
- Yeah, Jack.

165
00:10:58,512 --> 00:11:02,744
Look for a stretch of freeway at least
5,000 feet long. Straight enough to land on.

166
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:05,300
I'll pull up maps of the area, Jack.

167
00:11:05,392 --> 00:11:07,748
Get back to me
as soon as you got something.

168
00:11:07,832 --> 00:11:10,027
- We can't land on the freeway.
- Yes, we can.

169
00:11:10,113 --> 00:11:14,230
It's late, there's a curfew,
there won't be any cars on the freeway.

170
00:11:14,312 --> 00:11:17,907
Cuff your right hand
to the flight controls now.

171
00:11:22,952 --> 00:11:25,147
All the way.

172
00:11:26,432 --> 00:11:28,821
Just start taking us down.

173
00:11:32,312 --> 00:11:34,268
Do it now.

174
00:11:58,071 --> 00:12:01,381
- What's Chloe O'Brian doing here?
- I don't know.

175
00:12:03,191 --> 00:12:05,466
Ms Hayes.
- You can go.

176
00:12:05,551 --> 00:12:08,509
- What's going on?
- An F-18's been sent to shoot Jack down.

177
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:11,866
Can you open up a socket
with the ATC radar tracking plot?

178
00:12:11,951 --> 00:12:13,383
- I think so.
- Do it.

179
00:12:13,471 --> 00:12:16,985
We need to know the amount of time
Jack has before the plane reaches him.

180
00:12:17,071 --> 00:12:21,109
Look at this. We have two possible
landing sites. This one's the best shot.

181
00:12:21,191 --> 00:12:23,580
I agree. Let's get Jack on the phone.

182
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:30,583
I need to speak with you.

183
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:35,139
We need to make an emergency landing.
Get your passengers ready.

184
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:38,222
- What's happening?
- Everything'll be fine. Get them ready.

185
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:40,744
OK.

186
00:12:40,829 --> 00:12:45,345
OK, listen up, everybody. We're going
to prepare for an emergency landing.

187
00:12:46,629 --> 00:12:49,018
- Bauer.
- I think we've found something.

188
00:12:49,109 --> 00:12:53,900
Bill, hold on one second, I want to
put you on speakerphone. Go ahead.

189
00:12:53,989 --> 00:12:57,777
It's a stretch of the 118 freeway
between mile-markers 91 and 92.

190
00:12:57,869 --> 00:13:01,145
- 4,000 feet, then there's an overpass.
- That's not long enough.

191
00:13:01,229 --> 00:13:04,983
- It's the best we can do.
- Copy that, Bill. Hold on. Give me a second.

192
00:13:05,069 --> 00:13:10,268
You can either try and land this plane
on the freeway, or I will.

193
00:13:11,789 --> 00:13:14,427
Give me the coordinates.

194
00:13:14,509 --> 00:13:20,697
3450.2 north by 11030.4 west.

195
00:13:20,788 --> 00:13:25,304
- We need to know where that F-18 is.
- Jack, it's Chloe. I'm working on it.

196
00:13:25,389 --> 00:13:28,266
- Manning.
- We have the exact location.

197
00:13:28,348 --> 00:13:32,182
- Go ahead.
- 118 freeway. Mile-markers 91 and 92.

198
00:13:32,268 --> 00:13:34,988
- He should be there within minutes.
- Redirecting.

199
00:13:35,068 --> 00:13:36,899
- 118 freeway.
- Yep.

200
00:13:39,628 --> 00:13:43,337
We're five minutes away.
I'm patching us in with the pilot of the F-18.

201
00:13:43,428 --> 00:13:44,543
Go ahead.

202
00:13:45,427 --> 00:13:50,296
<i>Bravo One, it's Kirkland. You're on
with the president and myself. Report status.</i>

203
00:13:50,387 --> 00:13:53,504
My radar is locked on the target.

204
00:13:59,108 --> 00:14:03,544
- OK, I've got the ATC radar plot.
- Put it on the main screen.

205
00:14:03,627 --> 00:14:06,778
Jack, the F-18 is within 15 miles.

206
00:14:06,867 --> 00:14:10,780
- He'll be within range in two minutes.
- You're not descending fast enough.

207
00:14:10,867 --> 00:14:13,256
We won't be able to pull out of the dive.

208
00:14:13,347 --> 00:14:19,582
We don't get on the ground before that F-18
reaches us, it's not gonna matter. Descend!

209
00:14:26,746 --> 00:14:29,500
Put the oxygen masks on!

210
00:14:32,027 --> 00:14:36,781
Target has increased angle and rate
of descent. One minute from missile lock.

211
00:14:37,346 --> 00:14:39,986
Jack, they're almost within weapons range.

212
00:14:40,066 --> 00:14:43,695
- The aircraft can't take this. I have to pull up.
- Not yet!

213
00:14:58,346 --> 00:15:00,654
I can see the freeway!

214
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:04,061
Come on.

215
00:15:04,146 --> 00:15:06,819
OK, level up now. Now!

216
00:15:10,145 --> 00:15:12,705
We can't pull out the dive.

217
00:15:13,945 --> 00:15:16,823
I need your help. Pull!

218
00:15:19,145 --> 00:15:21,261
Ground proximity alert.

219
00:15:23,745 --> 00:15:28,182
<i>20 seconds to missile lock.
Target's at 1,000 feet and levelling.</i>

220
00:15:28,265 --> 00:15:30,459
<i>- Levelling?
- Affirmative, sir.</i>

221
00:15:30,545 --> 00:15:32,103
What does that mean?

222
00:15:32,185 --> 00:15:38,532
Target may be preparing to land.
The objective seems to be the 118 freeway.

223
00:15:41,425 --> 00:15:43,654
- Lower the landing gear.
- We're going too fast!

224
00:15:43,744 --> 00:15:45,895
Lower it!

225
00:15:49,265 --> 00:15:50,538
Lowering his landing gear.

226
00:15:52,464 --> 00:15:54,614
The F-18's in range.

227
00:15:57,664 --> 00:16:01,736
<i>- I have missile lock.
- I recommend we abort.</i>

228
00:16:01,824 --> 00:16:03,735
<i>- What?
- The parameters have changed.</i>

229
00:16:03,823 --> 00:16:07,817
I want that plane shot down.
Order your man to fire, now!

230
00:16:07,904 --> 00:16:10,861
Mr. President. Admiral Kirkland is right.

231
00:16:10,944 --> 00:16:14,903
The aircraft's not a threat.
There's no reason to do this.

232
00:16:14,983 --> 00:16:18,293
I implore you to reconsider.

233
00:16:19,263 --> 00:16:23,461
<i>Sir, we have a lock.
What are your orders?</i>

234
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:26,617
- Abort.
- Yes, sir.

235
00:16:26,703 --> 00:16:30,412
But if they don't land, I want you
to shoot that plane down immediately.

236
00:16:30,503 --> 00:16:34,495
Yes, Mr. President.
Bravo One, hold fire. I repeat, hold fire.

237
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:36,653
Copy, base. Bravo One, holding fire.

238
00:16:36,742 --> 00:16:41,578
We have marine units deployed in the area.
I want them to apprehend Jack Bauer.

239
00:16:41,663 --> 00:16:43,654
Yes, sir.

240
00:16:46,622 --> 00:16:50,615
- 500 feet.
- We're not gonna make it.

241
00:16:58,622 --> 00:17:00,214
<i>CTU.</i>

242
00:17:00,302 --> 00:17:03,977
<i>I've spotted the plane. They're coming in.
We're heading towards them.</i>

243
00:17:04,462 --> 00:17:08,171
I'm handing the controls back to you.
Touch it down.

244
00:17:08,262 --> 00:17:10,651
- We're still going too fast!
- Touch it down!

245
00:17:20,182 --> 00:17:24,220
Target's touched down.
All clear. Returning to base.

246
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:52,935
- Bill, we made it. We're down on the ground.
- We've redirected Curtis to your location.

247
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:56,296
I'm just east of the Balboa overpass.
Have him meet me there.

248
00:17:56,381 --> 00:17:59,929
<i>Send a secondary team to pick up the copilot.</i>

249
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:02,011
Got it. Get out of there, Jack.

250
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:11,128
Everyone keep moving
to the rear of the plane.

251
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:13,609
Exit from the rear, now!

252
00:18:44,539 --> 00:18:47,656
You should have ordered that pilot to fire.

253
00:18:47,739 --> 00:18:52,892
They were landing on the freeway. I had no
pretext to shoot them down. I had to abort.

254
00:18:52,979 --> 00:18:56,972
It's gonna be much harder to contain
now Bauer's on the ground.

255
00:18:57,058 --> 00:19:02,497
Even before the plane touched down, I
ordered two battalions of marines to the area.

256
00:19:02,578 --> 00:19:08,654
They're cordoning off the landing site,
even as we speak. Bauer has nowhere to run.

257
00:19:09,618 --> 00:19:12,496
I hope you're right. This is our last chance.

258
00:19:12,578 --> 00:19:15,172
I know.

259
00:19:15,258 --> 00:19:17,851
I know what's at stake, Graham.

260
00:19:20,018 --> 00:19:23,693
I'll get back to you
as soon as I have any news.

261
00:19:41,577 --> 00:19:43,728
- Yeah?
- Curtis, it's Jack.

262
00:19:43,817 --> 00:19:46,172
The marines are moving in. Where are you?

263
00:19:46,257 --> 00:19:49,852
We're approaching your position
from the north.

264
00:19:51,577 --> 00:19:56,446
OK, I got you. I'll meet you
on the north side of the freeway.

265
00:20:16,297 --> 00:20:19,527
- We gotta get outta here now.
- Move.

266
00:20:30,136 --> 00:20:33,845
Dammit. You're gonna have to try
and talk your way through the roadblock.

267
00:20:33,936 --> 00:20:38,612
- Get your hands up!
- Everybody in the vehicle, hands up!

268
00:20:39,736 --> 00:20:43,205
- Hands where we can see them.
- We're federal agents.

269
00:20:43,296 --> 00:20:45,684
Los Angeles Counter Terrorist Unit.

270
00:20:45,776 --> 00:20:48,448
We have to detain
everybody inside this perimeter.

271
00:20:48,536 --> 00:20:51,971
We're on the same team.
We're trying to apprehend the hijacker.

272
00:20:52,055 --> 00:20:55,286
- Jack Bauer?
- That's right. Now, let us do our job.

273
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:58,173
I need to see individual IDs.
I'm gonna call this in.

274
00:20:58,255 --> 00:21:01,691
The longer we sit here,
the better chance Bauer has.

275
00:21:01,775 --> 00:21:05,324
- This will only take a minute.
- A minute is all Bauer needs to escape.

276
00:21:05,415 --> 00:21:08,487
We're not prepared to let that happen.
We're moving out.

277
00:21:08,575 --> 00:21:12,852
If you really want to fire on federal agents,
that's your call.

278
00:21:15,574 --> 00:21:18,327
- Stand down.
- Move out.

279
00:21:20,414 --> 00:21:22,405
Stand down.

280
00:21:31,014 --> 00:21:34,973
- Head east for a while, then turn south.
- Yes, sir.

281
00:21:35,053 --> 00:21:37,852
<i>- Buchanan.
- We've got Jack. We're heading back.</i>

282
00:21:37,933 --> 00:21:41,973
- OK, Curtis.
- Marines are everywhere. We barely got past.

283
00:21:42,053 --> 00:21:44,966
They must be taking direct orders
from Logan.

284
00:21:45,054 --> 00:21:48,204
We can't run into any more patrols.
We'll use back streets.

285
00:21:48,294 --> 00:21:51,730
Understood.

286
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:55,325
<i>- Hayes.
- I wanna know what's going on.</i>

287
00:21:55,413 --> 00:21:58,167
Miles, I said I would tell you
when the time was right.

288
00:21:58,253 --> 00:22:03,202
I'm watching you work with two people
under arrest for aiding and abetting a fugitive.

289
00:22:03,293 --> 00:22:07,605
<i>If you don't talk to me,
I'll have to get my answers somewhere else.</i>

290
00:22:07,692 --> 00:22:10,525
I'll be right there.

291
00:22:11,812 --> 00:22:14,122
- Don't tell him.
- I can't hold him off any longer.

292
00:22:14,213 --> 00:22:18,968
- You really think that's a good idea?
- I have to trust him.

293
00:22:19,053 --> 00:22:24,366
He's been nothing but loyal. I probably
shouldn't have kept him in the dark this long.

294
00:22:24,452 --> 00:22:26,647
I'll be right back.

295
00:22:40,132 --> 00:22:45,286
- I don't appreciate being threatened, Miles.
- And I don't appreciate being shut out.

296
00:22:45,971 --> 00:22:52,047
We've worked a lot of years together, Karen,
and I have never wavered in my allegiance.

297
00:22:52,532 --> 00:22:54,726
I don't deserve this.

298
00:22:56,732 --> 00:22:58,927
No, you don't.

299
00:23:01,452 --> 00:23:04,045
Come with me.

300
00:23:19,251 --> 00:23:24,450
Jack Bauer's acquired evidence implicating
President Logan in David Palmer's death.

301
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:27,443
- Have you seen this evidence?
- Bauer's bringing it here.

302
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:31,683
- What is it?
- A recording of a conversation.

303
00:23:31,771 --> 00:23:37,845
You haven't heard it. That's what you're doing
with Buchanan and O'Brian? Helping Bauer?

304
00:23:37,931 --> 00:23:39,443
Yes.

305
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:44,684
Logan has done everything in his power
to keep Jack from getting back here alive.

306
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:49,719
You're working against the president
and you haven't actually heard the evidence.

307
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:52,483
- This is why I didn't ask you.
- You knew I'd talk you out of it.

308
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:56,245
I know what I'm doing is risky.
If I'm wrong, my career is over.

309
00:23:56,329 --> 00:24:00,881
- Not just your career, Karen.
- I believe that Bauer is telling the truth.

310
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:04,201
But you don't know. OK, OK.

311
00:24:04,689 --> 00:24:10,446
Let's say he is. Let's say
that recording implicates Logan.

312
00:24:10,529 --> 00:24:12,520
Then what are you gonna do?

313
00:24:12,609 --> 00:24:16,000
Are you gonna arrest
the President of the United States?

314
00:24:16,089 --> 00:24:18,444
- That will be up to the attorney general.
- You're...

315
00:24:18,529 --> 00:24:20,645
- Sorry to interrupt.
- Yes?

316
00:24:20,729 --> 00:24:25,564
- They're ready to move Bierko.
- Thank you. I'll be right out.

317
00:24:26,969 --> 00:24:33,841
Look, I have to go over the transfer protocols.
I know what I'm asking from you is difficult.

318
00:24:33,928 --> 00:24:38,001
Everything rests
with what's on that recording.

319
00:24:40,449 --> 00:24:43,406
- Tell me what you need.
- Bauer will be here any minute.

320
00:24:43,489 --> 00:24:47,276
The best way for you to help me
is to keep things running smoothly.

321
00:24:47,368 --> 00:24:51,680
- All right.
- Miles. It's imperative this stays between us.

322
00:24:51,768 --> 00:24:54,282
- Of course.
- Thank you.

323
00:25:17,208 --> 00:25:18,163
Thank you.

324
00:25:18,247 --> 00:25:24,243
We have a full tactical complement, enhanced
ordinance package, two-vehicle escort.

325
00:25:25,247 --> 00:25:32,005
Vladimir Bierko, you are being transferred to
a primary holding facility at our headquarters.

326
00:25:33,047 --> 00:25:35,686
- Let me know the second he arrives.
- Understood.

327
00:25:35,766 --> 00:25:37,962
Let's move out.

328
00:26:12,846 --> 00:26:14,836
Let's go.

329
00:26:44,764 --> 00:26:46,995
<i>- Where is Novick?
- He's on his way.</i>

330
00:26:47,084 --> 00:26:51,316
<i>- You told me that three minutes ago.
- Yes, sir.</i>

331
00:26:54,284 --> 00:26:57,162
I'm sorry.
I was on the phone with Colonel Owens.

332
00:26:57,244 --> 00:27:00,077
- He's the field commander on the site.
- Is Bauer in custody?

333
00:27:00,164 --> 00:27:02,837
- No, sir.
- What happened?

334
00:27:02,924 --> 00:27:06,883
As ordered, the marines sealed off
a one-mile radius around the landing site.

335
00:27:06,965 --> 00:27:10,354
- They've completed a sweep of the area.
- And?

336
00:27:10,444 --> 00:27:17,474
And it's Colonel Owen's estimation
that Bauer is no longer inside the perimeter.

337
00:27:18,643 --> 00:27:21,442
- He got away?
- It appears so, sir.

338
00:27:24,163 --> 00:27:26,552
I can't believe this.

339
00:27:26,643 --> 00:27:31,512
Mr. President, it's only a matter of time
before Bauer's apprehended.

340
00:27:45,523 --> 00:27:47,957
Sir, are you all right?

341
00:28:01,923 --> 00:28:05,881
Thank you, Mike. I need some time alone now.

342
00:28:58,401 --> 00:29:01,234
The attorney general's
on his way to his office now.

343
00:29:01,321 --> 00:29:03,390
He'll be ready in ten minutes.

344
00:29:03,481 --> 00:29:07,156
OK, good. Chloe, I want you
to prepare the recording for playback.

345
00:29:07,241 --> 00:29:10,916
Apply a digital signature
so we can establish a chain of evidence.

346
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,959
Work alone. I don't want
anyone else near that recording.

347
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:16,474
- Don't let it out of your sight.
- I won't.

348
00:29:16,561 --> 00:29:19,154
You said I had ten minutes.
I'd like to see Audrey.

349
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:22,551
- Of course. She's in Medical.
- Thank you.

350
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:29,078
<i>- He's in ICU.
- When will I be able to speak with him?</i>

351
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:33,039
<i>- I'm sorry, I really don't know.
- All right. I understand.</i>

352
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,429
Just let him...

353
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:43,838
Can you please tell him that his daughter
called and that she loves him very much?

354
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:46,638
<i>- Yes, ma'am.
- Thank you.</i>

355
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:52,078
- It looks like my dad's gonna be all right.
- Yeah, I know. I heard.

356
00:29:53,999 --> 00:29:56,718
Oh, God, I'm so glad to see you.

357
00:29:57,199 --> 00:29:59,190
Me too.

358
00:30:06,199 --> 00:30:08,235
We did it.

359
00:30:08,318 --> 00:30:13,187
We got the evidence.
The attorney general's going to hear it.

360
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:15,712
- So it's over.
- Yeah.

361
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:22,313
President Logan's gonna pay
for David Palmer's assassination.

362
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:24,390
Thank you.

363
00:30:31,318 --> 00:30:35,596
Close your eyes.
I'm gonna sit with you for a minute.

364
00:31:26,476 --> 00:31:28,944
<i>- Yes?
- Graham.</i>

365
00:31:29,037 --> 00:31:32,187
<i>- I've been trying to reach you.
- I know.</i>

366
00:31:32,276 --> 00:31:35,029
- Bauer slipped through, didn't he?
- Yes.

367
00:31:35,117 --> 00:31:40,065
I've just been told that the attorney general's
office received a phone call

368
00:31:40,156 --> 00:31:42,351
from the director of CTU.

369
00:31:42,436 --> 00:31:46,031
I think it's fairly obvious
they're in possession of the recording.

370
00:31:46,116 --> 00:31:48,755
I think that phone call was about you.

371
00:31:49,836 --> 00:31:52,714
I didn't expect it to happen so soon.

372
00:31:53,756 --> 00:31:56,987
I am sorry, Charles. You don't deserve this.

373
00:31:57,075 --> 00:31:59,111
Listen, Graham.

374
00:31:59,196 --> 00:32:04,428
Despite how things turned out,
I still believe that we were in the right.

375
00:32:04,515 --> 00:32:07,985
I still believe that we acted
in the best interests of the country.

376
00:32:08,075 --> 00:32:11,511
And we have to keep putting
the country's wellbeing ahead of our own.

377
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:15,747
<i>The spectacle of a sitting president
on trial for murder would be devastating.</i>

378
00:32:15,835 --> 00:32:17,712
Yes.

379
00:32:17,795 --> 00:32:19,911
Yes, it would.

380
00:32:19,995 --> 00:32:22,509
Aside from the psychological damage
to the country,

381
00:32:22,594 --> 00:32:28,749
a trial would expose certain realities
that should never see the light of day.

382
00:32:28,835 --> 00:32:31,906
If only we could keep such a trial
from taking place.

383
00:32:34,075 --> 00:32:36,713
That thought occurred to me as well.

384
00:32:36,795 --> 00:32:39,706
<i>I'm glad we agree.</i>

385
00:32:39,794 --> 00:32:45,949
I've taken steps to ensure that you and your
associates won't be implicated in any of this.

386
00:32:46,034 --> 00:32:49,947
I appreciate that, Charles. We all do.

387
00:32:54,554 --> 00:32:57,591
I have nothing more to say.

388
00:32:57,674 --> 00:33:04,307
I'm going to hang up now. There are a few
things I'd like to take care of before...

389
00:33:05,594 --> 00:33:07,265
Goodbye, Charles.

390
00:33:09,833 --> 00:33:11,869
Goodbye, Graham.

391
00:33:54,312 --> 00:33:56,872
Martha, may I come in?

392
00:33:58,272 --> 00:34:01,308
- Now you want to talk?
- Marty, please.

393
00:34:03,792 --> 00:34:06,385
What do you want?

394
00:34:16,351 --> 00:34:19,980
Is there something else you wanna confess?

395
00:34:20,071 --> 00:34:21,663
No.

396
00:34:33,511 --> 00:34:36,309
I wanna tell you how sorry I am.

397
00:34:36,391 --> 00:34:39,064
For everything.

398
00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:49,506
When you forget to give me something
for my birthday,

399
00:34:49,591 --> 00:34:53,266
that's when you say you're sorry.

400
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:59,346
I know what I did was wrong. It was horribly
wrong, and unforgivable. I know that.

401
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:04,828
But what I can't live with
is the fact that I hurt you.

402
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:09,461
That's the last thing I wanted to do.

403
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:16,949
Marty? Marty, please.

404
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:23,342
That's the truth.

405
00:35:26,109 --> 00:35:28,100
The truth?

406
00:35:35,589 --> 00:35:38,467
You know what really gets me, Charles?

407
00:35:38,549 --> 00:35:42,258
- What?
- That you had me going for so long.

408
00:35:44,068 --> 00:35:47,141
I had no idea you were such a good liar.

409
00:35:49,028 --> 00:35:55,548
If I wasn't so horrified by that fact that I'm
married to you, I might actually be impressed.

410
00:38:05,744 --> 00:38:08,213
<i>- Yes?
- I'm sorry to disturb you, sir.</i>

411
00:38:08,305 --> 00:38:11,297
<i>I have an urgent call coming in from CTU.</i>

412
00:38:12,305 --> 00:38:17,094
<i>- I don't want to talk to anyone from CTU.
- He insists that you'll want to speak with him.</i>

413
00:38:17,184 --> 00:38:20,176
<i>He says it's concerning Jack Bauer.</i>

414
00:38:26,744 --> 00:38:29,099
<i>- Put him through.
- Yes, sir.</i>

415
00:38:29,184 --> 00:38:33,257
<i>- Go ahead. You're on with the president.
- Mr. President?</i>

416
00:38:33,344 --> 00:38:39,499
- Yes, go ahead.
- Miles Papazian. I work under Karen Hayes.

417
00:38:39,584 --> 00:38:43,099
<i>- What is this about?
- It's about a recording, sir,</i>

418
00:38:43,184 --> 00:38:46,699
that Jack Bauer
has just delivered here to CTU.

419
00:38:46,783 --> 00:38:52,699
Sir, my understanding is it's a recording
of a conversation of yours that, if leaked,

420
00:38:52,784 --> 00:38:57,493
could significantly compromise
national security.

421
00:38:58,023 --> 00:39:01,299
- Go on.
- My superior, Ms Hayes,

422
00:39:01,383 --> 00:39:04,978
is working with Bauer and Bill Buchanan.

423
00:39:05,063 --> 00:39:08,612
Their intention is to play the recording
for the attorney general.

424
00:39:10,902 --> 00:39:14,657
- Why are you telling me this?
- Because, sir,

425
00:39:14,742 --> 00:39:17,131
I feel compelled to intervene.

426
00:39:18,182 --> 00:39:22,812
<i>And I just wanted to make sure
that you would approve.</i>

427
00:39:26,022 --> 00:39:29,219
I do, Mr. Papazian. I do approve.

428
00:39:32,262 --> 00:39:38,292
Listen, um... I'm going to text you
my private number.

429
00:39:39,701 --> 00:39:41,772
Let me know how it goes.

430
00:39:41,862 --> 00:39:43,341
And Miles...

431
00:39:44,982 --> 00:39:48,019
I promise you I won't forget this.

432
00:39:48,101 --> 00:39:51,139
Thank you, sir. That's all I wanted to hear.

433
00:39:51,702 --> 00:39:56,492
<i>Mr. President, I look forward
to speaking with you again soon.</i>

434
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:37,378
How long before the teleconference starts?

435
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:40,770
Five minutes. Get out of here, Miles.

436
00:40:40,861 --> 00:40:43,613
- We'll be ready?
- Not if you keep interrupting me.

437
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:48,410
- I'm just doing my job, Chloe.
- If your job is to slow things down.

438
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:52,094
- I'll tell Karen you'll be ready.
- Thanks.
