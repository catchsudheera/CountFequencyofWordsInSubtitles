1
00:00:13,907 --> 00:00:20,065
What happened to Palmer shouldn't have. He
got involved in something he shouldn't have.

2
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:23,702
- You know who killed David?
- He works for me.

3
00:00:23,792 --> 00:00:25,227
You lied to me.

4
00:00:25,313 --> 00:00:29,594
This entire day has been one giant lie.

5
00:00:29,676 --> 00:00:32,636
- What you've done makes me sick!
- Martha, enough.

6
00:00:32,717 --> 00:00:35,279
I need you to swear to me

7
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:38,478
that you will do as I ask...

8
00:00:38,561 --> 00:00:39,711
for the country.

9
00:00:39,802 --> 00:00:40,917
I hate you.

10
00:00:41,764 --> 00:00:43,675
The situation with Martha is taken care of.

11
00:00:43,764 --> 00:00:47,759
There are too many loose ends.
We cannot have her unravel everything.

12
00:00:47,846 --> 00:00:48,882
She won't.

13
00:00:48,967 --> 00:00:50,242
I have the recording.

14
00:00:50,328 --> 00:00:52,559
- Have you destroyed it?
- No, sir, I have not.

15
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:55,768
You and I have been in this
from the beginning.

16
00:00:55,852 --> 00:00:58,242
Destroying that recording protects both of us.

17
00:00:59,294 --> 00:01:01,684
- I got O'Brian.
- Where is she?

18
00:01:01,775 --> 00:01:04,051
She's working out of Bill Buchanan's house.

19
00:01:04,137 --> 00:01:06,732
Did Chloe tell you why she
was helping Audrey Raines and Bauer?

20
00:01:06,818 --> 00:01:11,815
She thinks Jack is innocent.
That President Logan framed Bauer.

21
00:01:12,622 --> 00:01:14,739
<i>This is Karen Hayes. Miles traced Chloe.</i>

22
00:01:14,823 --> 00:01:17,338
<i>You have less than seven minutes
to get Chloe out.</i>

23
00:01:17,425 --> 00:01:20,657
- Karen, why are you warning us?
- Because I may have made a mistake earlier.

24
00:01:20,746 --> 00:01:24,058
Chloe, if they find you here,
you'll be arrested. You have to go now.

25
00:01:24,149 --> 00:01:25,502
Not yet.

26
00:01:34,354 --> 00:01:37,632
It's over, Christopher. Turn around.

27
00:01:38,277 --> 00:01:40,109
- Give me the recording.
- I don't have it.

28
00:01:40,198 --> 00:01:41,267
Where is it?

29
00:01:41,358 --> 00:01:44,671
Henderson doesn't have the recording.
There must've been a hand-off.

30
00:01:44,761 --> 00:01:47,481
- Henderson rendezvoused with another car.
- Can you track the other car?

31
00:01:47,562 --> 00:01:52,161
We're tracking it. It headed back to Van Nuys.
Looks like the civilian side of the airfield.

32
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:53,998
<i>Pulled onto the tarmac.</i>

33
00:01:54,086 --> 00:01:57,046
<i>Whoever it was got onto the plane.</i>

34
00:01:57,127 --> 00:01:58,720
<i>It is a chartered diplomatic flight.</i>

35
00:01:58,809 --> 00:02:02,724
<i>We've tried everything.
We can't delay the plane.</i>

36
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:19,179
OK, call me when you got 'em. Yeah.

37
00:02:19,261 --> 00:02:21,492
Are you out? The team's almost there.

38
00:02:21,582 --> 00:02:24,337
Chloe's packing the comm gear she needs.

39
00:02:24,425 --> 00:02:26,894
<i>- Where is Jack?
- Van Nuys airport.</i>

40
00:02:26,986 --> 00:02:30,343
- He stowed away on a flight that just took off.
- What? Why?

41
00:02:30,428 --> 00:02:33,341
He's trying to find a recording
that implicates Logan.

42
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:37,664
- And someone on that flight has it?
- Yes. Chloe's been trying to find out who.

43
00:02:37,752 --> 00:02:39,186
Hang on. Yeah?

44
00:02:39,273 --> 00:02:42,950
Field team's a block away.
I'll set up here for the debrief of O'Brian.

45
00:02:43,035 --> 00:02:45,596
- No, put it in the situation room.
- I thought...

46
00:02:45,677 --> 00:02:49,114
I want it in the situation room. Go.

47
00:02:53,961 --> 00:02:56,876
The field team will be there any second.
Get Chloe out.

48
00:02:56,963 --> 00:02:58,761
- How close are they?
- One block.

49
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:01,964
I'll run interference.
It's more important she gets away.

50
00:03:02,046 --> 00:03:05,564
I'll bring you in. You'll be treated
as a suspect. We never talked.

51
00:03:05,648 --> 00:03:08,848
- Understood. They're here. Out the back.
- Bill, wait.

52
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:13,131
Have Chloe call me on a dry channel,
either one-five or two-seven.

53
00:03:13,213 --> 00:03:16,332
Dry channel one-five or two-seven. Got it.

54
00:03:17,856 --> 00:03:20,816
There's a gate in the back.
Follow the path to the alley.

55
00:03:20,898 --> 00:03:23,493
- Turn right.
- What about the curfew?

56
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:26,812
There's a hotel.
You should make it without being spotted.

57
00:03:26,901 --> 00:03:30,976
- What about you?
- I'll be at CTU, probably in Holding.

58
00:03:31,064 --> 00:03:33,625
- Why Holding?
- Karen will place me under arrest.

59
00:03:33,706 --> 00:03:38,577
If you need anything, contact her.
Chloe, please, just go.

60
00:03:53,717 --> 00:03:56,916
- Who is it?
Homeland Security.

61
00:03:56,999 --> 00:04:01,678
Mr. Buchanan, we need you to open the door.
We're under order from Karen Hayes.

62
00:04:01,762 --> 00:04:03,958
I'll be right there.

63
00:04:10,607 --> 00:04:13,726
- What's going on?
- Step aside. We need to search the house.

64
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:16,644
No, I'm not stepping aside.
Do you have a warrant?

65
00:04:16,731 --> 00:04:19,201
- Where's Chloe O'Brian?
- I have no idea.

66
00:04:19,293 --> 00:04:21,854
Don't make us use force.
We know she's been here.

67
00:04:21,934 --> 00:04:25,008
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Where is she?

68
00:04:25,096 --> 00:04:28,089
I don't know where Chloe O'Brian is.

69
00:04:37,743 --> 00:04:39,735
She's not here.

70
00:04:42,386 --> 00:04:45,266
Sir, this is a recent file from Comm.

71
00:04:45,348 --> 00:04:47,817
Only O'Brian could access it.

72
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:50,747
Talk to us, sir.

73
00:04:52,672 --> 00:04:55,950
I'm not talking to you. I'll talk to Karen Hayes.

74
00:05:03,599 --> 00:05:06,273
- Papazian.
Mr. Papazian, we are on site.

75
00:05:06,361 --> 00:05:09,399
<i>It appears Chloe O'Brian was here
but she has gone.</i>

76
00:05:09,482 --> 00:05:12,043
<i>- Is Bill Buchanan there?
- Yes, sir.</i>

77
00:05:12,124 --> 00:05:13,876
- We lost O'Brian.
- Dammit.

78
00:05:13,965 --> 00:05:16,355
Put him on the phone, please.

79
00:05:17,287 --> 00:05:19,244
- Hello?
- Don't play games with me.

80
00:05:19,328 --> 00:05:22,879
Just give me O'Brian's location
or I will make it very bad for you.

81
00:05:22,971 --> 00:05:26,328
From what I understand,
she got out of CTU right under your nose.

82
00:05:26,412 --> 00:05:29,531
- You're the one who ought to be concerned.
- This is Hayes.

83
00:05:29,614 --> 00:05:33,735
Tell us what you know now.
Stop wasting our time.

84
00:05:33,817 --> 00:05:35,888
I'm not saying any more.

85
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:41,409
- This is Ed.
- Ed, bring Buchanan in.

86
00:05:41,502 --> 00:05:46,055
Set up a search for Chloe. She's probably got
a car which means she's about 15 miles out.

87
00:05:46,144 --> 00:05:47,863
<i>Copy that.</i>

88
00:05:47,945 --> 00:05:50,859
But the agents on site
are trained for interrogation.

89
00:05:50,947 --> 00:05:53,462
- Why are you bringing him in?
- I wanna run this.

90
00:05:53,549 --> 00:05:58,705
- But now it's us who are wasting time.
- Don't worry. I will make him talk.

91
00:05:58,792 --> 00:06:01,307
I'll be in my office.

92
00:06:58,147 --> 00:07:01,026
<i>- Yeah.</i>

93
00:07:01,109 --> 00:07:03,829
I'm at the Miramont.
Make sure no one looks here.

94
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:06,745
I'll take care of that.
Tell me what else you need.

95
00:07:06,832 --> 00:07:10,030
Jack's on diplomatic flight 520.
Pull up the manifest.

96
00:07:15,037 --> 00:07:16,869
Got it. Flight 520 to Frankfurt.

97
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:21,751
OK. Put everything you've got from that flight
onto the shared volume so I can get to it.

98
00:07:27,204 --> 00:07:29,766
- Done.
- OK. I see it.

99
00:07:29,845 --> 00:07:31,838
Thanks.

100
00:07:38,571 --> 00:07:41,246
Yeah.

101
00:07:41,332 --> 00:07:43,324
<i>- Are you OK?
- Did you get it?</i>

102
00:07:43,413 --> 00:07:46,248
I got the passenger list.
I'll cross it against Henderson.

103
00:07:46,335 --> 00:07:48,771
- What about the air marshal?
- In a minute.

104
00:07:48,857 --> 00:07:52,374
- What's happening at CTU?
- They're still under orders to stop you.

105
00:07:52,459 --> 00:07:54,610
- Karen Hayes is backing us.
- Openly?

106
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:58,615
No, but she's letting me help you.
If there's proof against Logan she wants it.

107
00:07:58,703 --> 00:08:01,172
The proof is on this plane.
Check the manifest.

108
00:08:01,264 --> 00:08:04,941
Figure out who has a connection
to Henderson. Find the air marshal's seat.

109
00:08:05,027 --> 00:08:06,620
I will.

110
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:13,862
We could grab some shuteye.
- I don't think so.

111
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:18,744
Oh, hey. I was just asking.
You don't have to go all feminist on me.

112
00:08:18,834 --> 00:08:22,273
You see that? 21st-century woman.

113
00:08:22,357 --> 00:08:25,236
We'd better get used to it.

114
00:08:31,923 --> 00:08:35,041
Yeah.

115
00:08:35,124 --> 00:08:38,801
I found the air marshal.
His name is George Avila. He's sitting in 7 A.

116
00:08:38,886 --> 00:08:40,924
- Is anyone sitting next to him?
- No.

117
00:08:41,008 --> 00:08:45,084
Get back to me when you've got
the connection to Henderson.

118
00:09:21,511 --> 00:09:23,505
Excuse me.

119
00:09:37,962 --> 00:09:40,318
Excuse me. Is that seat taken?

120
00:09:41,684 --> 00:09:43,641
No.

121
00:09:43,725 --> 00:09:46,878
Thanks.
The stewardess said I could change seats.

122
00:09:46,967 --> 00:09:52,522
I was next to the galley. It's kinda noisy.
I'm trying to get some rest.

123
00:10:15,704 --> 00:10:17,536
Yeah.

124
00:10:18,706 --> 00:10:22,497
The man you're looking for is in seat 12D.
His name is Hans Meyer.

125
00:10:22,588 --> 00:10:26,219
He's been connected to Omicron
since the mid-1990s.

126
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:29,110
He's worked directly with Henderson.
That's it.

127
00:10:29,192 --> 00:10:31,184
OK, I've got it.

128
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,316
- Mr. Meyer.
- Yes?

129
00:10:46,402 --> 00:10:50,193
- My name's George Avila. I'm the air marshal.
- What's wrong?

130
00:10:50,285 --> 00:10:54,917
We found something we think is yours. It
should've been in the baggage compartment.

131
00:10:55,007 --> 00:10:59,049
We'd like you to come back to the galley
and identify it for us so we can stow it.

132
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:03,045
Please, sir. We'd really appreciate it.

133
00:11:03,132 --> 00:11:06,730
- If you have any carry-on bags, bring them.
- I don't.

134
00:11:06,814 --> 00:11:09,535
Very well.

135
00:11:15,179 --> 00:11:17,854
- What makes you think it was mine?
- Ticket stub.

136
00:11:58,005 --> 00:12:00,805
They have taken away all my medication.
I need it.

137
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:05,405
I'm sorry, ma'am.
They won't let me give that to you.

138
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:08,642
What do they think I'm gonna do?
Kill myself?

139
00:12:08,731 --> 00:12:11,200
Over that son of a bitch?

140
00:12:13,254 --> 00:12:17,454
I just called the President of the United States
a son of a bitch. No reaction?

141
00:12:17,537 --> 00:12:22,739
He must have some kind of law on the books
against that. Or am I immune?

142
00:12:22,819 --> 00:12:25,016
Just like he is.

143
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:33,060
Do you have a first name, Agent Adams?

144
00:12:33,146 --> 00:12:35,263
It's Justin, ma'am.

145
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:40,941
You don't have much of a personality,
do you, Justin?

146
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:51,586
This is Novick.

147
00:12:51,677 --> 00:12:54,750
I- it's Martha. Are you still on the retreat?

148
00:12:55,919 --> 00:13:02,032
- Yes. I'm just down the hall from your room.
- I need you to come here right away.

149
00:13:02,123 --> 00:13:04,319
I'll be right there.

150
00:13:20,774 --> 00:13:24,405
- They've cut me off from my medication.
- You haven't been cut off.

151
00:13:24,496 --> 00:13:29,015
Dr Hill said you had enough in your system
right now. You need to wait a few hours.

152
00:13:29,098 --> 00:13:33,778
I don't want to wait a few hours, Mike.
I need something now.

153
00:13:33,862 --> 00:13:36,582
- What's going on?
- I don't need counselling, Mike.

154
00:13:36,663 --> 00:13:39,133
I just want a damn pill.

155
00:13:39,225 --> 00:13:41,786
Sit down.

156
00:13:41,866 --> 00:13:45,304
Thank you, Agent. You are dismissed.

157
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:52,187
We've, uh, been through
some tough times before, Martha.

158
00:13:52,273 --> 00:13:55,664
Just follow the doctor's orders for now.

159
00:13:57,316 --> 00:14:00,754
This is more than just a tough time.
None of this is gonna go away.

160
00:14:00,838 --> 00:14:02,909
I just have to live with it.

161
00:14:02,999 --> 00:14:08,794
What do you mean, it's not going to go away?
What are you talking about?

162
00:14:10,364 --> 00:14:12,640
I shouldn't have said that.

163
00:14:12,725 --> 00:14:14,921
Martha.

164
00:14:15,006 --> 00:14:16,998
It's me.

165
00:14:17,088 --> 00:14:19,683
You say what needs to be said.

166
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:24,804
What needs to be said I can't say to you.

167
00:14:24,892 --> 00:14:27,966
Why not?

168
00:14:29,455 --> 00:14:33,815
Listen, Mike, I-I just...
I just need to get some sleep.

169
00:14:33,897 --> 00:14:35,889
I'm just...

170
00:14:35,979 --> 00:14:38,653
My nerves are shot from today.

171
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:42,451
I just need something to calm me down.
I just need to get my medication.

172
00:14:42,542 --> 00:14:45,342
The president doesn't want you
to leave the room.

173
00:14:45,424 --> 00:14:47,382
Then you can bring it here.

174
00:14:48,506 --> 00:14:54,300
I just want to take a couple of pills.
I need to sleep. You can watch me take them.

175
00:14:59,233 --> 00:15:01,543
I'll see what I can do.

176
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,874
<i>- Yes?
- Have they found Bauer yet?</i>

177
00:15:15,963 --> 00:15:18,957
- No, they haven't.
- That's not good.

178
00:15:19,044 --> 00:15:23,598
I know that's not good.
I'm putting pressure everywhere I can.

179
00:15:23,687 --> 00:15:28,480
I don't have to tell you how disastrous it'd be
if Bauer gets his hands on that recording.

180
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:32,042
That's exactly right.
You don't have to tell me. I know.

181
00:15:32,132 --> 00:15:36,367
When I find him, I will call you.
Is there anything else?

182
00:15:36,455 --> 00:15:37,889
No.

183
00:15:37,975 --> 00:15:39,968
Good.

184
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:46,252
Mr. President.

185
00:15:48,462 --> 00:15:51,740
- What is it, Mike?
- Something I should call to your attention.

186
00:15:51,824 --> 00:15:52,814
Yes?

187
00:15:52,905 --> 00:15:56,262
Your wife is in a very agitated state.

188
00:15:56,347 --> 00:15:58,942
- I don't know how to proceed.
- Proceed with what?

189
00:15:59,028 --> 00:16:04,230
She wants me to bring her
her medication against doctor's orders.

190
00:16:04,312 --> 00:16:08,705
That's all I need right now, is to deal with her.
No, no! No more pills!

191
00:16:08,794 --> 00:16:11,788
And she shouldn't be wasting your time
with this anyway.

192
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:13,867
Mr. President.

193
00:16:15,718 --> 00:16:20,272
- Is there something I should know about?
- Why? What did she say?

194
00:16:20,841 --> 00:16:23,641
She needs more medication
to calm herself down.

195
00:16:23,723 --> 00:16:29,596
Something's clearly bothering her
but she didn't wanna talk about it.

196
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:33,247
I don't see where any of this
becomes your business.

197
00:16:33,328 --> 00:16:37,609
I'll tell you where, Mr. President.
I'm your Chief of Staff.

198
00:16:37,691 --> 00:16:43,052
If there's something going on that involves
national security, it is my business.

199
00:16:51,059 --> 00:16:55,612
This isn't national security, Mike.
It's our marriage.

200
00:16:55,702 --> 00:16:58,696
I think both of us realised today...

201
00:16:59,704 --> 00:17:02,539
that our relationship
is nothing more than a facade,

202
00:17:02,626 --> 00:17:05,938
and one that we'll have to keep up
for as long as I'm president.

203
00:17:06,028 --> 00:17:08,463
I think that...

204
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:11,588
she's reacting to that, Mike.

205
00:17:13,072 --> 00:17:14,904
I see.

206
00:17:16,154 --> 00:17:18,544
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Mike.

207
00:17:19,756 --> 00:17:21,953
Give her what she wants.

208
00:17:22,037 --> 00:17:24,712
Lord knows she's in a lot of pain.

209
00:17:37,487 --> 00:17:41,846
- Where are you hiding it?
- Hiding what? What the hell is this?

210
00:17:41,929 --> 00:17:44,843
I know who you are.
I know your connection with Omicron.

211
00:17:44,931 --> 00:17:49,086
Henderson asked you to take something
out of the country for him. Where is it?

212
00:17:49,174 --> 00:17:52,293
Henderson. I have not seen him in months.

213
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:55,210
- Don't you lie to me.
- I am not lying, I swear.

214
00:17:55,297 --> 00:17:59,930
I know Henderson,
but I don't know what you're talking about.

215
00:18:00,019 --> 00:18:02,297
- Did you check your luggage?
- Yes.

216
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:04,453
Find it. Move!

217
00:18:09,225 --> 00:18:12,025
What are you doing?
- Nothing.

218
00:18:12,468 --> 00:18:14,538
- Homework?
- Homework, yeah.

219
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:18,702
I didn't know they had Wi-Fi in here.

220
00:18:19,712 --> 00:18:22,273
Could you leave me alone?
I can't talk right now.

221
00:18:22,353 --> 00:18:28,626
You're a little, uh, freaked out
because of the curfew thing. Join the club.

222
00:18:28,717 --> 00:18:30,436
Yeah, OK.

223
00:18:30,518 --> 00:18:33,512
When you come up for air, I'm buying.

224
00:18:41,525 --> 00:18:44,643
<i>- Airport customs.
- This is Chloe O'Brian from CTU.</i>

225
00:18:44,727 --> 00:18:46,958
I need to talk to Passenger Clearing.

226
00:18:47,048 --> 00:18:50,838
<i>- I'll need your verification.
- Agency ID CTU99A-12.</i>

227
00:18:52,211 --> 00:18:56,651
The captain turned on the "Fasten seat belt"
sign as we are expecting turbulence.

228
00:18:56,733 --> 00:19:01,857
Please return to your seat and make sure
your seat belt is securely fastened.

229
00:19:12,102 --> 00:19:16,702
The passenger in 12D must be in the lavatory.
Get him out. It's gonna shake pretty hard.

230
00:19:16,785 --> 00:19:20,701
- There's nobody in those. I just checked.
- Then where is this guy?

231
00:19:20,788 --> 00:19:23,907
I don't know.
Maybe he changed seats.

232
00:19:31,394 --> 00:19:35,515
Call the captain. Tell him the air marshal's
down and a passenger's missing.

233
00:19:35,597 --> 00:19:40,276
- What's going on here?
- Please be seated, sir. Now, sir.

234
00:19:41,961 --> 00:19:45,592
<i>- Yeah?
- The air marshal's been assaulted.</i>

235
00:19:45,683 --> 00:19:48,916
What? Assaulted?
What's going on back there?

236
00:19:49,004 --> 00:19:51,804
<i>He's been knocked out
and a passenger's missing.</i>

237
00:19:51,886 --> 00:19:56,360
OK. OK. Secure the cabin.
Keep the passengers under control.

238
00:19:56,449 --> 00:19:59,488
- What's going on?
- There's a problem. Is our door secure?

239
00:19:59,571 --> 00:20:03,726
- It is. What kind of problem?
- The air marshal's been knocked out.

240
00:20:03,813 --> 00:20:08,048
Call LA Center.
Get vectors for an emergency return.

241
00:20:09,137 --> 00:20:13,769
- Mr. Avila, what happened?
- The man seated next to me, where is he?

242
00:20:13,859 --> 00:20:17,331
- I didn't see him.
- We gotta find him. Dammit!

243
00:20:17,421 --> 00:20:20,540
- What?
- He's got my gun.

244
00:20:38,354 --> 00:20:40,346
Mike, come in.

245
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:48,433
So, do you have something for me?

246
00:20:52,363 --> 00:20:57,724
- This is enough for a couple of days. Dr Hill...
- Thank you, Mike.

247
00:21:08,372 --> 00:21:11,092
I'll get ready for bed now.
Is there something else?

248
00:21:11,174 --> 00:21:13,166
Yes, there is.

249
00:21:14,976 --> 00:21:21,612
Earlier, you said something to the effect that
I didn't know everything that was going on.

250
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:25,057
I was confused. I wanted my pills.

251
00:21:25,142 --> 00:21:29,423
- I don't think so.
- Are you calling me a liar?

252
00:21:30,105 --> 00:21:32,666
I just spoke with the president

253
00:21:32,747 --> 00:21:36,297
and I got the same feeling from him
that I get from you.

254
00:21:36,389 --> 00:21:39,588
- Which is?
- That you're both covering something up.

255
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:44,064
You know, Mike, I'm the one around here
who's supposed to be paranoid, not you.

256
00:21:44,153 --> 00:21:46,794
I know you, Martha.

257
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:52,396
And I know the president.
He said this is all about marital difficulties.

258
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:55,313
I think there's something else.

259
00:21:55,399 --> 00:21:57,392
What is it?

260
00:22:00,043 --> 00:22:02,274
Don't shut me out.

261
00:22:02,364 --> 00:22:06,075
- Maybe I can help you.
- There is something else, Mike.

262
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:08,477
It's between me and Charles.

263
00:22:08,567 --> 00:22:12,244
If that changes, I promise I'll let you know.

264
00:22:21,335 --> 00:22:24,534
I don't know what you think
Henderson gave me. I saw no one.

265
00:22:24,618 --> 00:22:28,214
I was picked up at the consulate
and brought directly here.

266
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:31,134
Is this your only luggage?
If you're lying, I'll know.

267
00:22:31,221 --> 00:22:33,417
I am not lying. Please.

268
00:22:33,503 --> 00:22:37,259
If someone on this plane
has something you want, it is not me.

269
00:22:37,345 --> 00:22:39,337
Yeah.

270
00:22:39,426 --> 00:22:42,419
- Jack, I don't think Hans Meyer is our guy.
- Why not?

271
00:22:42,508 --> 00:22:48,222
The time line doesn't match.
He's been in customs for the last three hours.

272
00:22:48,311 --> 00:22:51,032
The plane's turning. They know I'm on board.

273
00:22:51,113 --> 00:22:53,582
- Chloe, keep looking.
- OK.

274
00:23:05,001 --> 00:23:08,552
- Are you sure he's down there?
- There's nowhere else he can be.

275
00:23:08,644 --> 00:23:13,515
- Tell the pilot he can do it.
- There's a passenger with him. He could die.

276
00:23:13,607 --> 00:23:17,442
There's over 50 passengers up here.
Call them now.

277
00:23:17,529 --> 00:23:19,599
Do it.

278
00:23:23,612 --> 00:23:28,370
Captain, the air marshal says
the baggage area is secure

279
00:23:28,855 --> 00:23:31,166
a- and that you should begin.

280
00:23:37,981 --> 00:23:40,815
- Air's coming in.
- It's not coming in. It's going out.

281
00:23:40,903 --> 00:23:43,498
- What?
- They're depressurising this area.

282
00:23:43,584 --> 00:23:48,422
- What's gonna happen to us?
- If we don't get out we'll lose consciousness.

283
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:55,982
Jack, what's going on?
The security net issued a bulletin.

284
00:23:56,071 --> 00:23:58,826
- Patch me through to the pilot.
- I don't know if I can.

285
00:23:58,913 --> 00:24:02,749
They're depressurising this area.
We're gonna lose consciousness.

286
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,471
Yeah, Chloe.

287
00:24:12,561 --> 00:24:17,001
Jack needs us to patch him into the pilot.
Can you get through on a CTU subchannel?

288
00:24:17,084 --> 00:24:20,556
- I'll try. Hold on.
- I'll stay on the line.

289
00:24:23,008 --> 00:24:25,078
<i>- Air control officer 404.
- Yes.</i>

290
00:24:25,169 --> 00:24:29,403
Patch me through to the pilot
of diplomatic flight 520 out of Van Nuys.

291
00:24:30,211 --> 00:24:34,651
Hey, what've you got?
A little voice-over IP going on there?

292
00:24:34,734 --> 00:24:38,012
- Please leave me alone.
- No, seriously, I can help.

293
00:24:38,096 --> 00:24:42,331
I know a way for you
to get some free bandwidth.

294
00:24:42,419 --> 00:24:44,217
- Really?
- Absolutely.

295
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:47,260
- Sit down.
- Cool.

296
00:24:48,903 --> 00:24:51,623
Wow, nice piece.

297
00:24:52,385 --> 00:24:55,663
I've never seen one of these before.
What is that?

298
00:24:57,508 --> 00:25:00,103
It's a CTU series four.

299
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:03,024
Chloe, they've opened the line to the pilot.

300
00:25:03,112 --> 00:25:05,866
Thanks.
Jack, I'm putting you on with the pilot.

301
00:25:05,953 --> 00:25:07,945
Go ahead.

302
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:11,395
<i>This is Captain Stan Cotter.
Who am I speaking to?</i>

303
00:25:11,476 --> 00:25:14,311
My name is Jack Bauer.
I'm with CTU in Los Angeles.

304
00:25:14,398 --> 00:25:17,073
<i>- I'm in your baggage hold.
- What are you doing?</i>

305
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:20,757
I'll explain everything,
but you have to restore air pressure.

306
00:25:20,842 --> 00:25:22,959
Sir, I remind you I am a federal agent.

307
00:25:23,043 --> 00:25:26,674
What kind of a federal agent
knocks out an air marshal?

308
00:25:26,765 --> 00:25:30,647
I was patched through by CTU.
I couldn't have done that without clearance.

309
00:25:30,728 --> 00:25:33,927
Look, you have a gun
and you've breached airplane security.

310
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:38,403
Captain, this is a matter of national security.
Now, open the damn hatch.

311
00:25:39,293 --> 00:25:42,685
He couldn't have patched in through CTU
if he was hostile.

312
00:25:42,775 --> 00:25:48,536
There's no point taking a chance. In a minute
he'll pass out. The air marshal can handle it.

313
00:25:48,618 --> 00:25:52,056
Captain,
we are running out of air down here.

314
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:55,930
Captain, there is a man on board your plane
that is of danger to you.

315
00:25:56,023 --> 00:25:58,697
That's why I am here. Open the hatch.

316
00:26:03,267 --> 00:26:07,342
<i>- I can't do that.
- OK, you son of a bitch.</i>

317
00:26:38,648 --> 00:26:41,039
Move forward.

318
00:26:56,179 --> 00:26:59,092
- What was that?
- Aileron conduit's been breached.

319
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:01,332
- What?
- What do you think you're doing?

320
00:27:01,422 --> 00:27:05,178
- You'll kill everybody on this plane.
- That's up to you. Open the hatch.

321
00:27:05,264 --> 00:27:10,294
- I'm not letting you up here.
- Then you'll be responsible for everything.

322
00:27:12,268 --> 00:27:14,545
All right, all right, all right.

323
00:27:16,751 --> 00:27:20,302
I'm gonna stabilise the pressure
and let him up. Unlock the hatch.

324
00:27:20,392 --> 00:27:22,909
<i>The cockpit's secure. He can't get in here.</i>

325
00:27:22,994 --> 00:27:24,987
Yes, Captain.

326
00:27:27,957 --> 00:27:33,797
- Hey, what do you think you're doing?
- The captain ordered me to open the hatch.

327
00:27:35,162 --> 00:27:39,476
Both of you, turn around
and grab the wall. Now!

328
00:27:48,409 --> 00:27:50,606
You, in the baggage hold.

329
00:27:52,052 --> 00:27:53,963
Do it, now.

330
00:28:04,859 --> 00:28:06,851
Close it.

331
00:28:08,142 --> 00:28:10,134
Lock it.

332
00:28:13,424 --> 00:28:15,986
- Take me to the galley.
- Get back to your seats.

333
00:28:16,066 --> 00:28:18,535
- What's going on?
- Sit down!

334
00:28:18,627 --> 00:28:21,587
Stay in your seats.
Put your hands on your head.

335
00:28:21,669 --> 00:28:26,108
Do what I tell you and no one will get hurt.
If you don't, people will start to die.

336
00:28:26,192 --> 00:28:31,474
- Get the captain on the phone now.
- Sir, he's in the main cabin. He has a gun.

337
00:28:31,555 --> 00:28:36,188
- First class passengers to the main cabin.
- Everyone to the main cabin.

338
00:28:37,639 --> 00:28:41,111
This is Bauer. I have no intention
of hurting your passengers.

339
00:28:41,201 --> 00:28:45,162
- I need to find something that's on the plane.
- What do you want, Bauer?

340
00:28:45,243 --> 00:28:47,759
Remain in a holding pattern so I can search.

341
00:28:47,845 --> 00:28:50,963
If you're a federal agent
you know I have to land this plane.

342
00:28:51,047 --> 00:28:53,927
- That won't give me enough time.
- Not my problem.

343
00:28:54,008 --> 00:28:57,127
I have a gun. Your air marshal is down.
It is your problem.

344
00:28:57,210 --> 00:29:01,206
- You need to remain in a holding pattern.
- You do what you have to do, Bauer.

345
00:29:01,293 --> 00:29:06,050
My job is to land this airplane,
and that is what I am going to do.

346
00:29:06,136 --> 00:29:08,128
Captain! Captain!

347
00:29:28,381 --> 00:29:31,056
<i>- That's all we have on flight 520, sir.
- OK.</i>

348
00:29:31,143 --> 00:29:35,423
Look, I want updates on the situation
on a minute-by-minute basis if necessary.

349
00:29:35,506 --> 00:29:37,498
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

350
00:29:45,792 --> 00:29:46,781
<i>Yes?</i>

351
00:29:46,872 --> 00:29:49,341
I just got word from the FAA
about a hijacking

352
00:29:49,433 --> 00:29:53,111
aboard a diplomatic flight
that left Van Nuys a half-hour ago.

353
00:29:53,196 --> 00:29:54,470
So what?

354
00:29:54,557 --> 00:29:58,757
<i>- Jack Bauer is the hijacker.
- What is he doing on that flight?</i>

355
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:03,393
He's looking for the recording
that implicates me in David Palmer's death.

356
00:30:03,482 --> 00:30:08,035
Henderson handed it to somebody before he
was arrested. Jack must know it's on board.

357
00:30:08,125 --> 00:30:11,676
You shouldn't waste your time
talking to me. Order the plane down

358
00:30:11,767 --> 00:30:15,125
and grab Bauer before he can hurt us.

359
00:30:20,292 --> 00:30:22,967
What are you saying?
That he hijacked the plane?

360
00:30:23,053 --> 00:30:25,011
He has control of the cabin.

361
00:30:25,095 --> 00:30:27,816
- The pilot is landing the plane.
- The recording?

362
00:30:27,896 --> 00:30:31,254
There's no guarantee he'll find it
before the plane lands.

363
00:30:31,339 --> 00:30:36,132
After that it's all over. The president will have
his people arrest Jack at the airport.

364
00:30:36,221 --> 00:30:38,339
What are we supposed to do?

365
00:30:38,422 --> 00:30:42,418
Just keep helping Jack.
Chloe, I need to see that evidence.

366
00:30:42,506 --> 00:30:45,624
- Call me if you need anything from here.
- Fine.

367
00:30:52,271 --> 00:30:54,787
Give me a second.

368
00:30:55,273 --> 00:30:57,310
What's Bauer doing on flight 520?

369
00:30:57,394 --> 00:30:59,990
You have no idea, you little ass-kisser.

370
00:31:00,076 --> 00:31:04,117
You don't talk to my people like that, Bill.
Take him to Holding.

371
00:31:04,198 --> 00:31:06,760
It's no wonder CTU fell apart under that guy.

372
00:31:06,839 --> 00:31:12,759
Miles, I know you're trying to help,
but I'll take it from here, OK?

373
00:31:19,767 --> 00:31:23,365
<i>- Western Operations.
- Miles Papazian, Homeland Security.</i>

374
00:31:23,449 --> 00:31:26,410
Pass code 2166.
Put me through to Mike Novick.

375
00:31:26,491 --> 00:31:28,961
<i>One moment, please.</i>

376
00:31:29,933 --> 00:31:31,572
What is it?

377
00:31:32,094 --> 00:31:36,808
I need your input, sir, because
I'm having a problem with Karen Hayes.

378
00:31:36,897 --> 00:31:40,449
I'd like to preface what I'm about to tell you
by saying that I...

379
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:44,455
I don't have time for prefaces.
Hayes was called in to replace Buchanan.

380
00:31:44,542 --> 00:31:49,061
- She was hand-chosen by the vice president.
- I understand that, sir.

381
00:31:49,145 --> 00:31:51,865
Are you saying you feel
she's unfit to do the job?

382
00:31:51,947 --> 00:31:55,827
Four hours ago she relieved Bill Buchanan
for ineffectual leadership.

383
00:31:56,349 --> 00:32:01,506
<i>He's been working covertly with Chloe
O'Brian to aid Jack Bauer, a federal fugitive,</i>

384
00:32:01,592 --> 00:32:04,506
<i>which means he needs
to be dealt with appropriately.</i>

385
00:32:04,594 --> 00:32:07,952
- What has Karen done?
- She sent in a tac team to pick them both up.

386
00:32:08,036 --> 00:32:10,346
By the time they got there
O'Brian was gone.

387
00:32:10,437 --> 00:32:14,558
But instead of having the team
do the interrogation of Buchanan on site,

388
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:18,760
Karen wasted 20 minutes
by bringing him into CTU.

389
00:32:19,723 --> 00:32:24,003
Maybe she felt the interrogation
would be more effective with CTU resources.

390
00:32:24,086 --> 00:32:27,205
But sir, she isn't even using
rudimentary CTU resources.

391
00:32:27,287 --> 00:32:30,008
She wants to do a soft Q and A by herself.

392
00:32:30,089 --> 00:32:33,561
<i>Any leads we may have had
on O'Brian have dried up.</i>

393
00:32:33,651 --> 00:32:38,489
Wait a second, Miles. I'm not going to pass
judgement on Karen Hayes at this point.

394
00:32:38,574 --> 00:32:43,332
She's not interrogating a terrorist,
but a high-ranking federal employee.

395
00:32:43,417 --> 00:32:48,255
Sometimes finesse and diplomacy
are better than coercion.

396
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:53,371
Your concern is duly noted, Miles. If you'll
excuse me, I need to see the president.

397
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:06,667
- Karen...
- Shut up, Bill.

398
00:33:15,156 --> 00:33:17,751
We're offline. Now we can talk.

399
00:33:17,838 --> 00:33:21,958
Look, you can continue this charade
if you want to, but Jack needs our help.

400
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:25,512
And he's getting it.
But I am still in charge of this facility

401
00:33:25,602 --> 00:33:30,360
and until I see that evidence,
I must remain sceptical.

402
00:33:30,445 --> 00:33:33,917
Have you talked to Chloe?
What's Jack's status?

403
00:33:34,007 --> 00:33:37,206
He's searching the cabin
but the pilot is going to land.

404
00:33:37,289 --> 00:33:39,600
- How much time does Jack have?
- 15 minutes.

405
00:33:39,691 --> 00:33:44,642
To search 50 passengers? That's impossible.

406
00:33:45,454 --> 00:33:46,444
Yes?

407
00:33:46,535 --> 00:33:51,896
<i>The president and Mike Novick
want an update on the hijacking of flight 520.</i>

408
00:33:51,978 --> 00:33:53,207
Put them through.

409
00:33:53,739 --> 00:33:58,532
<i>- Go ahead, sir.
- This is the president. Talk to me about 520.</i>

410
00:33:58,622 --> 00:34:01,980
We know that Bauer's involved,
but we don't know why.

411
00:34:02,064 --> 00:34:06,936
Isn't it obvious? Bauer is a fugitive and he's
looking for safe passage out of the country.

412
00:34:07,026 --> 00:34:10,988
- That's certainly a possibility.
- Listen to me. This man is desperate.

413
00:34:11,069 --> 00:34:13,982
He will say or do anything.
He's not to be trusted.

414
00:34:14,511 --> 00:34:17,186
We need to take him down now, dead or alive.

415
00:34:18,713 --> 00:34:21,149
- Yes, sir.
- Mr. President.

416
00:34:21,235 --> 00:34:25,868
Look. You call the pilot. You tell him that
I don't care if Bauer is making threats or not.

417
00:34:25,958 --> 00:34:29,509
That plane has to land immediately,
and when it lands,

418
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:34,882
I want my Secret Service detail
to take him into custody. Is that clear?

419
00:34:34,963 --> 00:34:37,763
- Ms Hayes?
- Yes, Mr. President.

420
00:34:42,008 --> 00:34:45,241
The president had knowledge
of everything that's happened.

421
00:34:45,329 --> 00:34:50,726
He wants that plane down before Jack finds
the evidence. We have to buy him more time.

422
00:34:50,812 --> 00:34:55,252
I don't have the authority
to keep that plane from landing.

423
00:34:56,056 --> 00:35:00,176
- Sir, this still doesn't make sense to me.
- What?

424
00:35:00,259 --> 00:35:04,732
Jack Bauer has been on the right side of
everything that's happened today until now.

425
00:35:04,821 --> 00:35:07,781
Well, right now he is hijacking a plane.

426
00:35:07,863 --> 00:35:11,016
This man is not stupid.
He's appeared to do the right thing

427
00:35:11,105 --> 00:35:14,816
but right now he's backed into a corner
and he's desperate.

428
00:35:14,907 --> 00:35:19,779
- Do you really believe that, sir?
- I absolutely do. Bauer's lied to us all day.

429
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:21,862
He's played us all for fools.

430
00:35:50,728 --> 00:35:54,406
<i>- Flight Operations.
- This is Chloe O'Brian again.</i>

431
00:35:54,490 --> 00:35:57,882
The copilot Don Fagenson
didn't check in when he boarded 520.

432
00:35:57,973 --> 00:36:00,534
<i>- Mr. Fagenson didn't board.
- Why not?</i>

433
00:36:00,614 --> 00:36:03,083
<i>- He was replaced at the last minute.
- By whom?</i>

434
00:36:03,176 --> 00:36:06,010
<i>Scott Evans, the new copilot.</i>

435
00:36:15,463 --> 00:36:20,335
Here are your things. Go back to your seat.

436
00:36:22,547 --> 00:36:25,541
- Jack, it's the copilot Scott Evans.
- How do you know?

437
00:36:25,629 --> 00:36:30,069
He used to fly for Hatton Air, a charter
company that work exclusively for Omicron.

438
00:36:30,152 --> 00:36:33,065
Evans flew Henderson around for over a year.

439
00:36:33,154 --> 00:36:36,704
I need you to patch me through to the captain
so Evans can't hear me.

440
00:36:36,796 --> 00:36:38,275
OK.

441
00:36:40,918 --> 00:36:42,990
Sit down! Now!

442
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:47,553
Everybody, stay in your seats
and no one will get hurt.

443
00:36:48,963 --> 00:36:51,558
<i>- Are you OK?
- I'm fine.</i>

444
00:36:55,327 --> 00:36:59,288
<i>- Incoming comm on 139.
- Go ahead.</i>

445
00:36:59,369 --> 00:37:03,080
Captain, this is Jack Bauer.
I'm speaking to you on a discreet channel.

446
00:37:03,171 --> 00:37:06,483
The person that I'm looking for
is sitting next to you.

447
00:37:06,573 --> 00:37:09,408
- He's your copilot Scott Evans.
- That's ridiculous.

448
00:37:09,495 --> 00:37:12,489
Sir, Evans was a last-second replacement.

449
00:37:12,577 --> 00:37:17,176
Can you explain to me why you're not flying
with your regular copilot Don Fagenson?

450
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:22,823
Captain, Scott Evans has been connected
to a known terrorist.

451
00:37:22,903 --> 00:37:25,099
<i>You need to open the door.</i>

452
00:37:26,385 --> 00:37:28,661
This conversation is over.

453
00:37:30,508 --> 00:37:32,500
Dammit.

454
00:37:37,472 --> 00:37:41,308
- What did he want?
- He's desperate. He wants us to land.

455
00:37:41,754 --> 00:37:44,145
- This is messed up.
- Yeah.

456
00:37:45,837 --> 00:37:49,036
- Bad luck for you, huh?
- Why?

457
00:37:49,118 --> 00:37:51,681
Wasn't Don supposed
to have your seat tonight?

458
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,673
Yeah.

459
00:37:54,762 --> 00:37:57,197
What happened to him?

460
00:37:57,284 --> 00:38:00,164
I don't know. I got the call, so I'm here.

461
00:38:00,245 --> 00:38:02,237
Yeah.

462
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:10,042
Oh, God.

463
00:38:10,131 --> 00:38:12,044
What's wrong?

464
00:38:12,133 --> 00:38:16,413
Could you, uh...
could you take the stick for a second?

465
00:38:16,495 --> 00:38:18,886
- Are you OK?
Yeah.

466
00:38:18,977 --> 00:38:21,172
Just got a cramp in my leg.

467
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:27,051
Yeah. Those are a bitch.

468
00:38:27,141 --> 00:38:28,495
Yeah.

469
00:38:40,189 --> 00:38:43,661
I'm the only one
who can fly this plane.

470
00:38:45,873 --> 00:38:50,505
Now, you don't strike me as a man who's
willing to die for Christopher Henderson.

471
00:38:50,595 --> 00:38:53,065
Give me the recording.

472
00:38:54,157 --> 00:38:56,514
Do it.

473
00:39:05,764 --> 00:39:08,155
Slowly get up.

474
00:39:10,608 --> 00:39:12,803
Get back in your seat.

475
00:39:16,211 --> 00:39:21,083
You're gonna land this plane
or I'm gonna put a bullet in your head.

476
00:39:24,535 --> 00:39:27,449
- Yeah, Jack?
- Advise CTU I have the recording.

477
00:39:27,537 --> 00:39:31,214
I'll be on the ground in less than 15 minutes.

478
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:33,292
Got it.

479
00:39:53,393 --> 00:39:55,271
<i>- Yes?
- Charles.</i>

480
00:39:55,353 --> 00:40:00,306
If I'm gonna live with this
then you're gonna have to help me.

481
00:40:01,397 --> 00:40:05,074
- Help you do what, Martha?
- Understand.

482
00:40:05,159 --> 00:40:06,513
I...

483
00:40:06,601 --> 00:40:10,151
I know you're... a good man

484
00:40:10,243 --> 00:40:13,237
and that deep down you...

485
00:40:13,325 --> 00:40:16,921
you do what's best for this country.

486
00:40:17,007 --> 00:40:19,603
- Of course I do.
- Then why...

487
00:40:21,169 --> 00:40:24,800
why didn't you come to me? Why...?

488
00:40:24,891 --> 00:40:29,649
<i>I- I would have been there for you.
I... could've talked you through it.</i>

489
00:40:29,734 --> 00:40:34,287
For the last three years you've been one click
away from a nervous breakdown every day,

490
00:40:34,377 --> 00:40:37,371
and I'm gonna come to you for advice?

491
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:43,054
- I have to take another call.
- Oh, no. Charles, no...

492
00:40:43,142 --> 00:40:44,861
We'll talk later.

493
00:40:51,507 --> 00:40:53,703
- Yes?
- Bauer's got the evidence.

494
00:40:53,789 --> 00:40:57,545
- He is in control of the plane.
- How do you know that?

495
00:40:57,631 --> 00:41:02,150
We just picked up a call
from Chloe O'Brian to Karen Hayes.

496
00:41:02,233 --> 00:41:04,225
What do we do?

497
00:41:04,315 --> 00:41:08,595
You are going to have to shoot down
that plane, Mr. President.

498
00:41:08,677 --> 00:41:11,147
- What?
- It's the only option we've got.

499
00:41:11,239 --> 00:41:13,914
Otherwise you go to prison.

500
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,197
<i>For treason and murder.</i>
