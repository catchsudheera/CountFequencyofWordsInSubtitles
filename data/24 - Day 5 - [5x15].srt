1
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:18,539
I am issuing an executive order
imposing a curfew on all civilians

2
00:00:18,622 --> 00:00:21,821
in the Los Angeles metropolitan area.

3
00:00:21,903 --> 00:00:25,738
<i>This will be effective immediately
and will be enforced by the military.</i>

4
00:00:25,825 --> 00:00:28,544
They're talking like it's an illegal action.

5
00:00:28,625 --> 00:00:32,904
Don't worry, Mr. President.
I'm in control of the situation.

6
00:00:32,986 --> 00:00:36,059
Has it occurred to you
that he proposed this to set you up?

7
00:00:36,147 --> 00:00:40,824
- Hal's only motivation is what's best.
- There's going to be fallout. And you know it.

8
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:43,105
You're here to shut this place down.

9
00:00:43,189 --> 00:00:45,943
- I told you, the White House...
- I know what you told me.

10
00:00:46,029 --> 00:00:49,341
- Now tell me the truth.
- CTU is being absorbed by Homeland.

11
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:52,662
From now on every operational decision
needs to go through me.

12
00:00:53,071 --> 00:00:57,191
There's something from my brother
I need to give you. I'll be there in an hour.

13
00:00:57,272 --> 00:01:00,744
<i>- You're coming here?
- I'd rather see you sooner than later.</i>

14
00:01:00,833 --> 00:01:02,824
<i>I'm hoping we can meet discreetly.</i>

15
00:01:18,958 --> 00:01:23,316
- Does she have the schematics and codes?
Yes. Everything we need.

16
00:01:23,399 --> 00:01:27,712
We'll release the Sentox here
and 200,000 people die.

17
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:31,919
The decryption key
is Charlie, Alpha, three, nine, Alpha.

18
00:01:32,001 --> 00:01:34,197
It worked. This is what you wanted.

19
00:01:34,682 --> 00:01:35,910
Drop the gun!

20
00:01:36,002 --> 00:01:38,563
I'm with the German
Federal Intelligence Service.

21
00:01:38,643 --> 00:01:41,954
I've been gathering intel
on Collette's clientele.

22
00:01:42,044 --> 00:01:45,958
If we don't find Bierko, hundreds
of thousands of innocent people will die.

23
00:01:46,045 --> 00:01:48,161
Let him go. He's given us what we want.

24
00:01:48,246 --> 00:01:50,635
Put your hands up!

25
00:01:50,726 --> 00:01:55,084
As for the data I sold Bierko, I received it
from a contact at the Department of Defense.

26
00:01:55,167 --> 00:01:58,763
- What's his name?
- Her name. Audrey Raines.

27
00:01:59,768 --> 00:02:01,487
You are lying to me.

28
00:02:01,569 --> 00:02:06,007
She sold me the information, Mr. Bauer.
Apparently, she had a price.

29
00:02:20,374 --> 00:02:23,253
Chloe, I need you
to do something for me right away.

30
00:02:23,334 --> 00:02:26,168
Check out Audrey's activities
in the last 18 months.

31
00:02:26,255 --> 00:02:29,168
- Audrey? Why?
- I'll explain later.

32
00:02:29,256 --> 00:02:33,295
I'm particularly interested in any connection
to Henderson or Cummings.

33
00:02:33,377 --> 00:02:38,498
- You think she's part of their conspiracy?
- I don't know what to think. Do it quickly.

34
00:02:40,339 --> 00:02:42,136
- Audrey?
- Yes?

35
00:02:42,219 --> 00:02:46,498
- I'm afraid I have to take you into custody.
- What? Am I being arrested?

36
00:02:46,581 --> 00:02:48,173
- Detained.
- On what grounds?

37
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:54,132
Collette Stenger's been passing information
to Bierko for him to use in his next attack.

38
00:02:54,222 --> 00:02:57,659
She claims she got the information
from DOD, and she named you.

39
00:02:57,743 --> 00:02:59,381
That's impossible.

40
00:02:59,464 --> 00:03:03,013
We already uncovered one mole
in the White House. I have no choice.

41
00:03:03,104 --> 00:03:06,177
What kind of information
did Stenger say I gave her?

42
00:03:06,265 --> 00:03:10,464
I've told you as much as I can at this point.
Prep Ms Raines for interrogation.

43
00:03:10,546 --> 00:03:15,940
- Does Jack know that I'm being detained?
- Yes. He sanctioned it.

44
00:03:17,308 --> 00:03:21,507
It's the truth. Audrey Raines was my contact
at the Department of Defense.

45
00:03:21,589 --> 00:03:23,820
- You met with her face to face?
- Yes.

46
00:03:23,909 --> 00:03:26,141
- Then you'd recognise her.
- Of course.

47
00:03:26,231 --> 00:03:30,191
She identified Ms Raines
through photographs on the way.

48
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:37,062
If you are lying to me, I'm gonna make this
the worst day of your life. You understand?

49
00:03:37,754 --> 00:03:40,143
Put her in Holding.

50
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,589
- Burke's interrogation method is a last resort.
- This warrants a more aggressive approach.

51
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,197
- Then do the same to Collette Stenger.
- Stenger has immunity.

52
00:04:11,282 --> 00:04:15,595
We can't touch her unless the information
she's provided turns out to be false.

53
00:04:15,683 --> 00:04:20,041
So we can torture our own people,
but we can't touch a criminal.

54
00:04:20,124 --> 00:04:24,642
I've known Audrey Raines for years.
I trust her implicitly. So does everyone else.

55
00:04:24,725 --> 00:04:28,196
Maybe that's the problem.
Bill, we don't have the luxury of time.

56
00:04:28,286 --> 00:04:31,757
Intel indicates that an attack is imminent.
Within an hour.

57
00:04:31,847 --> 00:04:34,203
Hundreds of thousands
of Americans are at risk,

58
00:04:34,288 --> 00:04:39,238
and we just got information
that Audrey Raines knows about it.

59
00:04:39,329 --> 00:04:41,480
Karen, the decision is yours.

60
00:04:41,569 --> 00:04:46,769
But any adverse consequences that result
from insufficiently aggressive action now

61
00:04:46,851 --> 00:04:49,605
will come down hard on you.

62
00:04:51,732 --> 00:04:55,248
- Why is Burke here?
- We're talking about medical interrogation.

63
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:56,402
- On Audrey?
- Yes.

64
00:04:56,494 --> 00:04:58,962
- That's ridiculous. I'll do it.
- I can't allow that.

65
00:04:59,054 --> 00:05:02,491
I brought this to you. I called it in.
You can't pull me off of this.

66
00:05:02,574 --> 00:05:05,932
Your emotional involvement
with Ms Raines is not a secret.

67
00:05:06,015 --> 00:05:09,407
- That has nothing to do with this.
- That's right.

68
00:05:09,497 --> 00:05:14,253
You always put the work first.
You never let your feelings get involved.

69
00:05:14,338 --> 00:05:17,251
Is that what happened with Nina Myers?

70
00:05:20,339 --> 00:05:23,093
Nina Myers was a mistake.
I've never denied that.

71
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:25,820
But she was deep cover for years
before I met her.

72
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:28,495
She fooled a lot of people, not just me.

73
00:05:28,582 --> 00:05:31,938
Well, maybe Audrey is fooling people too.

74
00:05:33,543 --> 00:05:38,902
You might be right. But I'd think twice about
who you're willing to invasively interrogate.

75
00:05:38,984 --> 00:05:42,660
Audrey is a senior advisor
to the secretary of defense, James Heller,

76
00:05:42,745 --> 00:05:44,623
who happens to be her father.

77
00:05:44,705 --> 00:05:48,824
And if you are wrong,
he's gonna eat you alive.

78
00:05:54,549 --> 00:05:59,225
At least let Jack talk to her
for ten minutes first. She deserves that much.

79
00:05:59,309 --> 00:06:03,349
If she's guilty... she doesn't deserve anything.

80
00:06:03,431 --> 00:06:07,505
That's the point.
She hasn't been proven guilty.

81
00:06:09,192 --> 00:06:11,183
You can see her for ten minutes,

82
00:06:11,273 --> 00:06:15,903
but at the first sign
you're less than objective, you're out.

83
00:06:17,954 --> 00:06:20,230
Understood.

84
00:06:31,278 --> 00:06:32,552
Thanks, Bill.

85
00:06:32,638 --> 00:06:35,915
- I don't believe Audrey's guilty of anything.
- Neither do I.

86
00:06:35,998 --> 00:06:41,233
The one thing we do know is Bierko's gonna
release the Sentox in the city in the next hour.

87
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:44,916
If Audrey knows anything that could help us,
she needs to tell us now.

88
00:06:45,001 --> 00:06:49,041
Keep an eye on traffic patrols.
Bierko's gonna need to move those canisters.

89
00:06:49,122 --> 00:06:51,842
With the curfew in place,
we might pick up the trail.

90
00:06:51,922 --> 00:06:53,322
Yeah.

91
00:07:03,646 --> 00:07:05,842
Hey, break it up!

92
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:08,122
Break it up now!

93
00:07:08,207 --> 00:07:11,199
Gentlemen, I said break it up!

94
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:25,482
- Take their uniforms and weapons.
Got it. Take it, all of it.

95
00:07:25,571 --> 00:07:29,964
Now we have a police escort to the target,
the curfew won't be a problem.

96
00:07:55,698 --> 00:07:59,852
Chloe, walk with me.
Are you running the background on Audrey?

97
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:02,534
- Yeah.
- What have you got?

98
00:08:02,621 --> 00:08:06,581
You won't like it. I found a connection
between Walt Cummings and Audrey.

99
00:08:06,662 --> 00:08:09,415
- What connection?
- She dealt with him a few times.

100
00:08:09,503 --> 00:08:14,259
It was the usual stuff between DOD and the
White House, but there was something else.

101
00:08:14,344 --> 00:08:16,381
What?

102
00:08:16,464 --> 00:08:19,104
Chloe, what?

103
00:08:19,185 --> 00:08:22,781
They both stayed
at the River Hotel in Pikesville last April.

104
00:08:22,865 --> 00:08:26,541
- So?
- Pikesville isn't a hot spot with top officials.

105
00:08:26,627 --> 00:08:28,983
It wasn't a coincidence.

106
00:08:29,067 --> 00:08:31,787
Chloe, what are you trying to say?

107
00:08:32,788 --> 00:08:37,181
They didn’t just stay in the same hotel,
they stayed in the same room.

108
00:08:37,269 --> 00:08:40,228
How could you possibly know that?

109
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:44,707
I emailed photos of them to the manager.
He recognised them both.

110
00:08:44,792 --> 00:08:50,789
He showed me phone bills, room service
receipts. I can show you if you want.

111
00:08:52,874 --> 00:08:55,183
No, no. I'm sorry.

112
00:08:57,915 --> 00:09:00,225
I believe you.

113
00:09:02,436 --> 00:09:08,433
It doesn't mean she was part of their
conspiracy, but it doesn't look good either.

114
00:09:10,238 --> 00:09:13,071
- Make copies of everything for me.
- I will.

115
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:15,150
Thanks.

116
00:09:55,809 --> 00:09:58,244
Excuse me.

117
00:09:59,011 --> 00:10:01,525
I'm Shari. I work in Section Five downstairs.

118
00:10:01,611 --> 00:10:04,604
- I know where Section Five is.
- Right.

119
00:10:04,692 --> 00:10:08,288
Uh, Mr. Buchanan told me
to report to Chloe O'Brian. Is that you?

120
00:10:08,372 --> 00:10:10,888
- You're gonna have to wait a second.
- Um...

121
00:10:10,974 --> 00:10:15,526
I'm here to replace Edgar.
I understand he died in the attack.

122
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,810
Yes, he did.

123
00:10:17,895 --> 00:10:20,888
Well, if he was a friend of yours, I'm sorry.

124
00:10:25,657 --> 00:10:27,137
Thanks.

125
00:10:27,217 --> 00:10:32,373
He worked at station six, right there. Are you
familiar with the Galvilan matrix analyser?

126
00:10:32,459 --> 00:10:35,417
- Yes, I am.
- Use it to check our databases are current.

127
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,889
Some of them may have fallen behind.

128
00:10:37,981 --> 00:10:40,256
No problem.

129
00:10:49,223 --> 00:10:51,294
Miles here.

130
00:10:55,024 --> 00:10:56,140
Jack...

131
00:10:56,225 --> 00:10:58,978
Sit down.

132
00:10:59,986 --> 00:11:02,580
Sit down.

133
00:11:07,588 --> 00:11:10,898
- Ever had contact with Collette Stenger?
- No.

134
00:11:10,989 --> 00:11:13,457
She says you gave her
information from the DOD.

135
00:11:13,549 --> 00:11:16,940
I know. Bill told me.
That's ridiculous. You know it.

136
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:22,390
- Jack, you're wasting time that we don't have.
- I had to ask CTU to let me interrogate you.

137
00:11:22,471 --> 00:11:25,385
I have a job to do.
If I don't do it Burke will, and I promise,

138
00:11:25,472 --> 00:11:29,433
you do not wanna see him
walk through that door.

139
00:11:29,513 --> 00:11:34,794
- Fine. What did she say I gave her?
- The structural schematics of Bierko's target.

140
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:39,154
- What kind of structure?
- She didn't know. She just delivered it.

141
00:11:39,236 --> 00:11:42,593
She claims I gave her information,
yet she can't say what it is.

142
00:11:42,677 --> 00:11:47,115
- And that's enough to make me a suspect?
- Dammit, you know what this nerve gas does.

143
00:11:47,198 --> 00:11:52,034
They are planning another attack.
We will not ignore any leads.

144
00:11:52,119 --> 00:11:55,795
- I have nothing to do with the terrorists.
- How did she get your name?

145
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:59,590
I don't know. My father is the secretary
of defense. I'm an easy target.

146
00:11:59,681 --> 00:12:03,561
Maybe she's trying to use him
or embarrass him.

147
00:12:03,642 --> 00:12:05,952
Is he involved?

148
00:12:09,243 --> 00:12:12,156
Oh, Jack, you know him better than that.

149
00:12:12,885 --> 00:12:19,041
You worked with him. He would never do
anything outside the law, and neither would I.

150
00:12:22,127 --> 00:12:25,517
The two men we know are part of this
are Cummings and Henderson.

151
00:12:25,607 --> 00:12:28,567
Have you had any contact with these men?

152
00:12:30,329 --> 00:12:35,279
Christopher Henderson I'd never heard...
I'd never heard of him before today.

153
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:37,930
And, um...

154
00:12:38,011 --> 00:12:40,606
Walt Cummings
I've met a couple of times, yes.

155
00:12:42,012 --> 00:12:45,800
- Where?
- Um, DOD briefings.

156
00:12:45,893 --> 00:12:48,454
- That's it?
- Yes.

157
00:12:50,935 --> 00:12:53,733
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

158
00:12:58,456 --> 00:13:00,607
Open it.

159
00:13:08,658 --> 00:13:11,174
The River Hotel, Pikesville, last April.

160
00:13:11,259 --> 00:13:16,459
Yeah, I'm sorry, um... We were there at the
same time. We may have had a drink together.

161
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:22,538
You weren't having drinks with him, you
shared a room with him. You slept with him.

162
00:13:23,943 --> 00:13:24,978
Yes.

163
00:13:28,624 --> 00:13:31,662
I was still recovering from losing you, Jack.

164
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:33,736
He, uh...

165
00:13:35,386 --> 00:13:40,256
He had just separated from his wife, and...
I slept with him once and then I broke it off.

166
00:13:40,346 --> 00:13:42,862
- Why'd you break it off?
- Jack, please...

167
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:45,587
Why did you break it off?

168
00:13:49,989 --> 00:13:52,584
Because he wasn't you.

169
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:03,629
Why did you lie to me
when I asked you the first time?

170
00:14:03,713 --> 00:14:06,273
Cos I... I was...

171
00:14:09,234 --> 00:14:12,591
I was afraid you'd think less of me,
that you wouldn't forgive me.

172
00:14:12,675 --> 00:14:14,791
Because you slept with someone?

173
00:14:14,876 --> 00:14:20,076
Because I slept with someone
who turned out to be a traitor, Jack.

174
00:14:27,439 --> 00:14:29,873
- Was that the only time you spent with him?
- Yes.

175
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:32,679
- Did he ever talk about a terrorist attack?
- No.

176
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:35,434
- Did he mention Christopher Henderson?
- No.

177
00:14:35,521 --> 00:14:37,432
- Dammit, Audrey!
- Jack... Stop!

178
00:14:37,522 --> 00:14:40,320
- Tell me the truth!
- I am telling you the truth!

179
00:14:40,402 --> 00:14:46,752
You already lied. Tell me what you know, or
I promise this will become very unpleasant.

180
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:49,153
I'm telling you everything.

181
00:14:50,165 --> 00:14:52,999
Go ahead. Do what you have to do.

182
00:14:53,085 --> 00:14:56,362
Dammit, Audrey, tell me the truth.

183
00:14:56,446 --> 00:15:00,680
Jack, I am telling you the truth, I swear.

184
00:15:04,928 --> 00:15:08,922
This is over. You understand? This is over!

185
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:13,320
- She broke him, not the other way around.
- Karen...

186
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:16,005
He didn't push hard enough.
He's protecting her.

187
00:15:16,092 --> 00:15:18,128
She's innocent.

188
00:15:18,212 --> 00:15:22,684
- We have to be certain.
- I am certain. Jack is certain.

189
00:15:24,574 --> 00:15:26,246
- Well, I'm not.
- Karen...

190
00:15:26,334 --> 00:15:28,450
Send Burke in. I have to do this, Bill.

191
00:15:28,534 --> 00:15:33,245
I can't waste any more time.
And make sure that Jack doesn't interfere.

192
00:15:37,897 --> 00:15:39,615
OK, I'll pass that on.

193
00:15:39,698 --> 00:15:43,247
Shari, that was the agent
at Bierko's safe house. The place is empty.

194
00:15:43,338 --> 00:15:48,858
Forensics are still looking,
but they don't expect to find much.

195
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:53,771
- Upload that information onto the subnet.
- Oh, right.

196
00:15:57,862 --> 00:16:01,742
I checked your file.
You're not qualified for level three work.

197
00:16:01,823 --> 00:16:03,814
And that... is level three.

198
00:16:03,943 --> 00:16:10,100
I'm provisionally qualified. It's all in my
supplemental file. Check it if you want.

199
00:16:10,185 --> 00:16:12,142
All right, Shari.

200
00:16:15,986 --> 00:16:19,981
First mistake, I yank the provisional
and you're out of here.

201
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:28,748
What's with him?

202
00:16:28,829 --> 00:16:34,303
Two years ago, we both worked in the San
Francisco office. It was sexual harassment.

203
00:16:34,391 --> 00:16:35,585
Miles?

204
00:16:35,672 --> 00:16:40,383
It was subtle at first, and then
it got really bad. I finally filed a grievance.

205
00:16:40,473 --> 00:16:43,944
- What happened?
- He got off with a warning.

206
00:16:44,034 --> 00:16:48,506
These things are hard to prove. They said
we didn't have enough evidence to go to trial.

207
00:16:48,594 --> 00:16:54,034
- I can't get into any details. The file is sealed.
- Don't worry, I don't need details.

208
00:16:54,476 --> 00:16:57,355
I guess I better not make any mistakes.

209
00:16:57,437 --> 00:16:59,507
Yeah.

210
00:17:01,358 --> 00:17:04,988
What's going on?
- I'm sorry. This is out of my control.

211
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:07,309
Karen wants to push Audrey a little harder.

212
00:17:07,399 --> 00:17:11,313
- No. Her interrogation is over.
- I'll try to stall her as long as I can.

213
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,359
I have orders to take Ms Raines
for interrogation.

214
00:17:14,441 --> 00:17:18,481
I don't care about your orders.
It's not gonna happen.

215
00:17:18,562 --> 00:17:21,396
Get out of my way.

216
00:17:21,883 --> 00:17:24,078
Get out of my way.

217
00:17:24,164 --> 00:17:27,474
Jack, don't make this
any harder than it is.

218
00:17:27,564 --> 00:17:29,601
Bill, do something!

219
00:17:29,685 --> 00:17:33,201
Let go of me! Bill, make them stop. Stop it!

220
00:17:33,286 --> 00:17:35,323
Bill! Bill!

221
00:17:55,124 --> 00:17:56,114
Hello?

222
00:17:56,204 --> 00:17:59,595
<i>- Mr. Henderson, it's Brennan.
- Is Wayne Palmer dead yet?</i>

223
00:17:59,685 --> 00:18:01,483
- No.
- Explain.

224
00:18:01,565 --> 00:18:04,240
We rolled his car,
but he survived and got away.

225
00:18:04,326 --> 00:18:08,320
<i>- It was sloppy. We'll make it right.
- You better. You know what's at stake.</i>

226
00:18:08,407 --> 00:18:10,683
Yes, sir.

227
00:18:11,808 --> 00:18:16,599
<i>This is Wayne Palmer.
At the tone, please leave a message.</i>

228
00:18:22,971 --> 00:18:26,726
Has Wayne Palmer come through
a checkpoint within the last half-hour?

229
00:18:26,812 --> 00:18:30,043
Yeah, checkpoint six 30 minutes ago.
He's not here yet?

230
00:18:30,133 --> 00:18:32,887
No, he's not. And I can't reach him on his cell.

231
00:18:32,973 --> 00:18:35,442
- If you're worried, I can send out an alert.
- No.

232
00:18:35,534 --> 00:18:38,732
I actually kind of want
to keep his visit under the radar.

233
00:18:38,815 --> 00:18:43,287
I'm gonna go out and take a look myself,
in case he had car trouble or something.

234
00:18:43,377 --> 00:18:46,255
Do me a favour.
Keep this between us, would you?

235
00:18:46,337 --> 00:18:48,647
- Yes, sir.
- Thanks.

236
00:18:53,979 --> 00:18:55,459
Thanks.

237
00:18:55,539 --> 00:18:58,213
You need to calm down
and remember who's in charge.

238
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:02,580
- Audrey Raines is innocent.
- She slept with a known conspirator and lied.

239
00:19:02,661 --> 00:19:07,453
She slept with him once, and lied cos she was
embarrassed. It hardly makes her part of this.

240
00:19:07,542 --> 00:19:12,095
- Why did Collette name her as the source?
- She got Audrey's name from Henderson.

241
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:16,497
- Why would he want to implicate Audrey?
- He doesn't want to implicate Audrey.

242
00:19:16,585 --> 00:19:21,182
He's after me, trying to make me lose focus,
and pull you off target. And he's done it.

243
00:19:21,265 --> 00:19:25,260
These plans were made some time ago,
when Henderson believed you'd be killed.

244
00:19:25,347 --> 00:19:27,498
Karen, you listen to me.

245
00:19:27,587 --> 00:19:31,422
This is what I do for a living.
The first rule is you have a contingency plan.

246
00:19:31,509 --> 00:19:35,502
This is his, and it's working.
You're getting ready to interrogate Audrey

247
00:19:35,589 --> 00:19:39,503
when you should interrogate Collette
because she still has information!

248
00:19:39,591 --> 00:19:44,666
Stenger has immunity. She's being protected
by a federal marshal. You made that deal.

249
00:19:44,752 --> 00:19:46,390
I know.

250
00:19:46,473 --> 00:19:49,909
But if I can prove she's
withholding information from us,

251
00:19:49,993 --> 00:19:54,863
that act alone negates her deal. I'll be able to
question her again. She'll give me Henderson.

252
00:19:54,955 --> 00:20:00,076
Once I have Henderson he'll lead us to the
nerve gas. That's what we should focus on.

253
00:20:00,156 --> 00:20:02,306
What are you suggesting we do, Jack?

254
00:20:02,397 --> 00:20:06,390
Let me and Chloe find proof
that Collette Stenger is lying to us.

255
00:20:06,477 --> 00:20:09,390
If we don't, you lose nothing. But if we do...

256
00:20:09,478 --> 00:20:13,473
we can stop this thing from happening,
I promise you.

257
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:15,869
Karen, please.

258
00:20:25,642 --> 00:20:27,633
Excuse me.

259
00:20:29,523 --> 00:20:33,597
These matrix sweeps are partials only.
Where's the rest of the data?

260
00:20:33,685 --> 00:20:37,473
- I thought matrix data could be unfiltered...
- That's not protocol.

261
00:20:37,565 --> 00:20:43,199
- I thought it was all right in-house.
- Only if it's authorised. Who authorised it?

262
00:20:43,287 --> 00:20:48,567
I did. She did it under my authority.
I take full responsibility.

263
00:20:50,009 --> 00:20:52,364
- I don't believe you.
- Believe what you want.

264
00:20:52,449 --> 00:20:57,081
That would be sloppy, O'Brian.
You don't work like that.

265
00:20:59,531 --> 00:21:04,482
She told you about my alleged sexual
harassment, right? Well, she's lying. Listen...

266
00:21:04,572 --> 00:21:10,091
You listen. There are 17 canisters of nerve gas
somewhere in LA. We're trying to find them.

267
00:21:10,174 --> 00:21:13,883
If you interrupt us one more time,
I'll file a complaint with Division.

268
00:21:13,975 --> 00:21:16,968
Then you'll see what protocol's all about.

269
00:21:28,058 --> 00:21:30,527
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

270
00:21:39,421 --> 00:21:42,812
- Chloe, we need to help Audrey.
- How?

271
00:21:42,902 --> 00:21:47,499
- Find a link between Collette and Henderson.
- We found Collette's name on his computer.

272
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:51,213
We need proof they had direct contact,
preferably more than once.

273
00:21:51,304 --> 00:21:53,580
You think he gave Collette Audrey's name?

274
00:21:53,665 --> 00:21:58,023
I'm sure of it. Use outside agencies,
including foreign. Put it on a priority channel.

275
00:21:58,106 --> 00:21:59,334
I'm on it.

276
00:22:08,108 --> 00:22:10,464
We have an important delivery.

277
00:22:10,549 --> 00:22:14,782
There's no delivery scheduled.
I'm gonna need to call this in.

278
00:22:23,072 --> 00:22:25,951
Stay out here and watch the perimeter.

279
00:23:09,724 --> 00:23:13,035
Very good. Finish off over there.

280
00:23:14,085 --> 00:23:16,725
Who's in charge?

281
00:23:16,806 --> 00:23:19,640
- I am.
- We need access to the control room.

282
00:23:19,726 --> 00:23:22,321
What are you guys doing here?

283
00:23:24,568 --> 00:23:27,128
Can you take us to the control room?

284
00:23:27,209 --> 00:23:30,121
- Yeah. It's that way.
- Good.

285
00:23:30,209 --> 00:23:32,883
Cooperate and no more
of your friends will die.

286
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:34,164
- Understand?
- Yes.

287
00:23:34,251 --> 00:23:37,561
Take the canisters
to the main distribution tank, quickly.

288
00:23:37,651 --> 00:23:39,290
Let's go.

289
00:23:48,414 --> 00:23:50,405
This is it.

290
00:24:03,018 --> 00:24:05,816
- Sam, what's going on?
- Ah, Sam.

291
00:24:05,899 --> 00:24:11,372
I'm not an engineer but I know enough,
so you'd be wise not to try to deceive me.

292
00:24:11,459 --> 00:24:13,577
What we're doing here is very simple.

293
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:17,814
We're going to release a certain substance
so it flows into your pipelines.

294
00:24:17,901 --> 00:24:21,451
- What kind of substance?
- That's not your concern.

295
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:24,819
But at the pressure
which currently prevails in these pipes,

296
00:24:24,903 --> 00:24:28,499
the substance will react chemically
with the gas and become inert.

297
00:24:28,584 --> 00:24:31,462
So I need the pressure reduced by about 50%.

298
00:24:31,545 --> 00:24:33,582
Sam, don't do it.

299
00:24:38,387 --> 00:24:41,141
Do you understand what I want?

300
00:24:41,227 --> 00:24:44,425
- You want PSI cut by half.
- Exactly.

301
00:24:45,669 --> 00:24:49,298
- How long will it take?
- It could take an hour.

302
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:52,905
You don't seem to care very much
for your friends, do you, Sam?

303
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:55,266
No, no! Don't!

304
00:24:55,351 --> 00:24:57,582
I might be able to do it in 30 minutes.

305
00:24:58,032 --> 00:25:00,421
You have 15.

306
00:25:00,512 --> 00:25:03,391
- Better get started.
- Yes, sir.

307
00:25:33,161 --> 00:25:35,436
Don't move.

308
00:25:35,522 --> 00:25:37,716
Drop the gun. Now!

309
00:25:41,563 --> 00:25:43,918
Move away from it.

310
00:25:52,766 --> 00:25:55,200
Now get on your knees.

311
00:25:56,207 --> 00:25:58,198
Mr. Palmer.

312
00:25:59,847 --> 00:26:02,521
It's Aaron.

313
00:26:02,608 --> 00:26:05,077
Oh, God.

314
00:26:05,168 --> 00:26:08,844
- Aaron, what are you doing out here?
- I was looking for you, sir.

315
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:11,649
So are some other people. Let's go.

316
00:26:14,811 --> 00:26:16,962
We know you conspired with Mr. Cummings.

317
00:26:17,052 --> 00:26:19,282
I didn't.

318
00:26:19,372 --> 00:26:22,729
- Who else in the White House was involved?
- I don't know.

319
00:26:22,813 --> 00:26:25,692
- You know, Ms Raines.
- I don't have... have any names.

320
00:26:25,774 --> 00:26:27,924
- Give me a name.
- I swear, I don't know...

321
00:26:28,015 --> 00:26:31,406
We don't have the time, Ms Raines.
Give me a name!

322
00:26:31,496 --> 00:26:34,886
I don't... I swear, I don't know.

323
00:26:37,577 --> 00:26:41,571
- What have you got?
- Masked entries in Collette's cell phone.

324
00:26:41,658 --> 00:26:46,255
- Come on.
- Henderson placed eight calls to her.

325
00:26:46,339 --> 00:26:49,093
- Where's Collette now?
- Holding room three.

326
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:51,570
Bill, we have a connection.

327
00:26:51,661 --> 00:26:54,893
Henderson made calls to Collette.
That voids her agreement.

328
00:26:54,981 --> 00:26:57,337
- It's for the president to decide.
- Call him.

329
00:26:57,422 --> 00:27:02,213
- You need a rescinding order!
- Get 'em to back off of Audrey!

330
00:27:03,223 --> 00:27:05,021
Get me the president.

331
00:27:15,547 --> 00:27:19,620
- What's your connection with Henderson?
- I have an immunity agreement.

332
00:27:19,708 --> 00:27:21,381
She can't be questioned.

333
00:27:21,468 --> 00:27:25,826
- Her deal's rescinded. The order's on its way.
- When it gets here, she's all yours.

334
00:27:25,909 --> 00:27:31,668
- An innocent woman is being interrogated!
- Look, I'm sorry, sir, but you have to go.

335
00:27:33,632 --> 00:27:37,545
We know you lied. We know you did not get
the schematics from Audrey Raines.

336
00:27:37,633 --> 00:27:42,344
Henderson told you to use her name
in case you got in trouble, right?

337
00:27:45,315 --> 00:27:48,113
You do not wanna try me.

338
00:27:50,396 --> 00:27:51,624
Yes.

339
00:27:55,117 --> 00:27:57,711
Did he tell you why?

340
00:27:58,797 --> 00:28:01,232
- No.
- He's using you.

341
00:28:02,478 --> 00:28:05,710
He wanted you to get inside my head.
And it worked.

342
00:28:05,799 --> 00:28:08,234
And now I'm...

343
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,436
upset.

344
00:28:10,521 --> 00:28:15,232
You have three seconds to tell me
where the target is, or I will kill you.

345
00:28:15,322 --> 00:28:18,280
Where is the target?!

346
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:20,514
A natural gas distribution centre.

347
00:28:20,603 --> 00:28:26,077
- There are dozens in the city. Which one?
- I don't know. I swear it.

348
00:28:29,525 --> 00:28:31,994
I don't know. I don't.

349
00:28:44,929 --> 00:28:49,402
- Jack, what's going on?
- The target's a natural gas distribution centre.

350
00:28:49,491 --> 00:28:50,480
Natural gas?

351
00:28:50,571 --> 00:28:53,803
He can use it to deliver Sentox,
to get it into people's homes.

352
00:28:53,892 --> 00:28:56,087
Get Chloe on it. We need to find which one.

353
00:28:56,172 --> 00:28:58,767
The rescinding order
will be here in 15 minutes.

354
00:28:58,853 --> 00:29:02,733
Give it to the marshal.
He'll be looking for this, too.

355
00:29:03,294 --> 00:29:08,529
Please, no more. I'm begging you,
please don't do that. Please...

356
00:29:08,615 --> 00:29:10,891
Please. I'm telling you the truth.

357
00:29:10,976 --> 00:29:14,811
- You're bringing this on yourself.
- Aaaaaargh! No!

358
00:29:14,897 --> 00:29:16,616
- Stop it!
- This can end...

359
00:29:16,697 --> 00:29:19,656
Shut it down! Shut it down now!

360
00:29:20,739 --> 00:29:24,972
You're finished in here. She is innocent.
You can confirm it with Buchanan.

361
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:27,858
I said, you're finished! Get out!

362
00:29:30,301 --> 00:29:33,374
- Are you all right?
- I don't know.

363
00:29:33,461 --> 00:29:36,454
It's over. I promise you, it's over for good.

364
00:29:36,543 --> 00:29:41,060
My God, what's happening to me?
What's happening?

365
00:29:41,143 --> 00:29:46,219
Henderson set you up to get at me,
to throw me off his trail. Now come here.

366
00:29:46,305 --> 00:29:48,695
I'm so sorry.

367
00:29:55,027 --> 00:29:58,338
Jack, the only thing that got me through this...

368
00:29:58,428 --> 00:30:00,738
was that I knew that you would come.

369
00:30:00,829 --> 00:30:02,945
I knew you would come.

370
00:30:16,112 --> 00:30:18,104
I'm so sorry.

371
00:30:25,355 --> 00:30:26,869
<i>- Bauer.
- It's Bill.</i>

372
00:30:26,955 --> 00:30:29,390
<i>Chloe's got some information. We need you.</i>

373
00:30:29,476 --> 00:30:31,353
Go.

374
00:30:31,437 --> 00:30:34,316
<i>- Jack?
- I'll be right there.</i>

375
00:30:34,397 --> 00:30:38,438
Bill, send someone over from Medical
to interrogation one, to tend to Audrey.

376
00:30:38,518 --> 00:30:40,987
<i>- All right.
- Thanks.</i>

377
00:30:50,441 --> 00:30:52,751
I'll be right back.

378
00:30:54,363 --> 00:30:56,354
Go. I'm OK.

379
00:31:02,165 --> 00:31:06,317
This only covers 60% % of the centres.
If our target's not there, we're out of luck.

380
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:10,685
- Can we redirect any other satellite?
- I'm trying.

381
00:31:12,247 --> 00:31:17,276
- Did you identify the distribution centre?
- We're pulling in more satellites.

382
00:31:17,368 --> 00:31:21,840
Once the Sentox hits the main tank and
goes into the pipes, it's impossible to stop.

383
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:25,162
- From there, it goes to people's homes.
- How many casualties?

384
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:28,607
Centres serve 90,000 people.
Could be twice as many casualties.

385
00:31:28,691 --> 00:31:32,082
- Intel says we have 15 minutes.
- I'll prep a team and go airborne.

386
00:31:32,172 --> 00:31:34,732
We'll be ready as soon as you ID a target.

387
00:31:35,773 --> 00:31:39,005
Mr. Buchanan, there may be a faster way.

388
00:31:39,094 --> 00:31:42,928
I was a chem major at Caltech.
Toxins become inert under high pressure.

389
00:31:43,015 --> 00:31:46,132
PSI would have to be lowered
before the gas was introduced.

390
00:31:46,216 --> 00:31:48,855
Chloe, can you monitor the pressure levels?

391
00:31:48,936 --> 00:31:53,374
Yeah. I have citywide readings
of them all. Hold on.

392
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:05,734
Wilshire Gas Company. The PSI's dropped
to 75% % in the past 10 minutes.

393
00:32:05,821 --> 00:32:09,337
We have to assume that's it.
I'll tell Jack. Great work, Shari.

394
00:32:09,422 --> 00:32:11,856
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

395
00:32:12,742 --> 00:32:18,102
Did you see the way his hand brushed across
my shoulder as he walked by?

396
00:32:18,184 --> 00:32:19,823
What?

397
00:32:19,904 --> 00:32:22,055
That was wrong.

398
00:32:22,145 --> 00:32:24,613
He shouldn't have done that.

399
00:32:46,591 --> 00:32:47,910
What is it?

400
00:32:47,991 --> 00:32:49,744
Get down!

401
00:32:58,154 --> 00:33:00,430
Come on.

402
00:33:51,247 --> 00:33:55,161
- Chloe, what's the PSI level?
- PSI level's down to 57%.

403
00:33:55,248 --> 00:33:57,638
Another seven is all they need.

404
00:33:57,729 --> 00:34:01,200
- How long will that take?
- Four, maybe five minutes.

405
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:04,681
The PSI level can only be adjusted
from the main control room.

406
00:34:04,771 --> 00:34:07,922
It's the large building,
two floors down from the roof.

407
00:34:08,012 --> 00:34:14,327
Copy that. OK, we'll insert here. We'll advance
to the control room and secure the canisters.

408
00:34:14,414 --> 00:34:18,487
We're almost there. The noise from the plant
should cover our descent.

409
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:41,934
We're ready.
- Good. Get back here.

410
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:43,818
<i>Da.</i>

411
00:34:47,782 --> 00:34:50,057
How much longer?

412
00:34:51,062 --> 00:34:53,896
A few more minutes.

413
00:34:53,983 --> 00:34:59,457
I can't lower the pressure any faster
without risking a shutdown.

414
00:35:02,226 --> 00:35:04,582
Chloe, do you have any heat signatures?

415
00:35:04,666 --> 00:35:08,023
Yes, but I can only scan
from the exterior of the site.

416
00:35:08,107 --> 00:35:10,337
There are two guards patrolling.

417
00:35:10,427 --> 00:35:14,945
I've given the pilot an approach vector
to keep you from their line of sight.

418
00:35:37,115 --> 00:35:40,108
- Maintain this position.
- Yes, sir.

419
00:35:42,876 --> 00:35:45,027
Go!

420
00:35:54,999 --> 00:35:57,673
CTU, the team's away.

421
00:35:57,759 --> 00:36:00,399
They're on the roof.

422
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,837
PSI level's down to 54%.

423
00:36:20,846 --> 00:36:22,962
CTU, we're inside.

424
00:36:23,046 --> 00:36:25,607
Jack, Bierko will be ready
to deploy any minute.

425
00:36:25,687 --> 00:36:27,564
Copy that.

426
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:19,419
Silencers off.

427
00:37:33,304 --> 00:37:35,659
Four.

428
00:37:45,147 --> 00:37:47,058
Bierko!

429
00:38:21,796 --> 00:38:24,106
He's moving. Cover me.

430
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:40,600
Curtis, the Sentox is already in the system.
Who's in charge here?

431
00:38:40,681 --> 00:38:44,595
Listen. You have nerve gas in your pipeline.
Can you shut down the pumps?

432
00:38:44,683 --> 00:38:47,720
By the time we power down,
the gas will be in the main tanks.

433
00:38:47,803 --> 00:38:49,999
I need a pipeline that feeds those tanks.

434
00:38:50,083 --> 00:38:52,997
Out the door to your left.
It'll have a red arrow on it.

435
00:38:53,084 --> 00:38:56,873
<i>- I need C4 and a timer. Get these people out.
- What are you doing?</i>

436
00:38:56,965 --> 00:38:59,799
To deliver the Sentox,
it had to mix with natural gas.

437
00:38:59,886 --> 00:39:04,438
If we can ignite that gas before it leaves
the plant, the Sentox will be incinerated.

438
00:39:04,527 --> 00:39:08,521
Bill, this is the last chance we've got
to stop this threat.

439
00:39:33,935 --> 00:39:38,293
Sentox has been in the system for one
minute. You've 60 seconds before it gets out.

440
00:39:47,138 --> 00:39:49,699
The charge has been set.

441
00:39:57,941 --> 00:40:01,412
- Curtis, are you clear?
- Just about.

442
00:40:01,502 --> 00:40:02,821
Keep going!

443
00:40:05,863 --> 00:40:08,298
Jack, are you clear?

444
00:40:08,384 --> 00:40:09,975
Jack?

445
00:40:11,064 --> 00:40:12,703
Jack, respond.

446
00:40:17,906 --> 00:40:19,579
Come on, Jack.

447
00:40:38,871 --> 00:40:41,022
