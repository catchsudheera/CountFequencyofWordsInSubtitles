1
00:00:14,048 --> 00:00:16,199
- What's going on?
- What do you mean?

2
00:00:17,169 --> 00:00:18,444
I'm your brother.

3
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:20,601
Whatever it is, you can tell me.

4
00:00:20,691 --> 00:00:23,411
- It's all right. Really.
- OK.

5
00:00:23,491 --> 00:00:25,687
One more chapter
and we'll take a break.

6
00:00:27,813 --> 00:00:29,611
David.

7
00:00:30,134 --> 00:00:31,250
Get help!

8
00:00:31,734 --> 00:00:36,207
Whoever did this, I want them dead
or in custody when the Russians get here.

9
00:00:36,296 --> 00:00:38,811
I would ask that you consider postponing
the signing of the treaty.

10
00:00:38,897 --> 00:00:40,968
No. Absolutely not.

11
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:46,978
I think that David was killed because of
something he was about to tell me.

12
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:50,815
He said that it concerned national security
and that it involved you.

13
00:00:52,782 --> 00:00:53,898
Is she all right?

14
00:00:53,982 --> 00:00:57,100
No, she's not all right.
She's having another one of her delusions.

15
00:00:57,584 --> 00:01:00,782
- What is this? An interrogation?
- I just don't like being lied to.

16
00:01:00,865 --> 00:01:02,902
No one's lying to you, Derek.

17
00:01:02,986 --> 00:01:05,057
I'm not hungry.

18
00:01:06,067 --> 00:01:07,581
Sorry.

19
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:10,229
You don't owe me an explanation.

20
00:01:10,308 --> 00:01:12,903
If you had wanted to tell me
about your past, you would have.

21
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:15,901
Yeah?

22
00:01:15,991 --> 00:01:19,462
Jack, I know this isn't protocol.
Please don't hang up on me. I need your help.

23
00:01:19,552 --> 00:01:23,751
<i>They got Tony and Michelle. She's dead. 
Tony's critical. They're gonna kill me. </i>

24
00:01:23,834 --> 00:01:25,232
What are you doing here?

25
00:01:25,314 --> 00:01:28,671
I'm sorry I followed you.
I'm just... I'm just worried about my mother.

26
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:29,870
You're going with me.

27
00:01:37,798 --> 00:01:39,118
Hold your fire, Chloe!

28
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:42,040
Palmer was the primary target.

29
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,311
To set you up.
Make it look like you did it.

30
00:01:46,401 --> 00:01:49,235
- You're the one that killed Palmer.
- Yeah.

31
00:01:58,926 --> 00:02:03,318
The president's retreat is vulnerable. You
need to post two more people here at Delta.

32
00:02:03,407 --> 00:02:07,641
- It's a likely point of infiltration.
- I'll pull assets from somewhere else.

33
00:02:07,729 --> 00:02:10,085
<i>- Marcy, hi. Can you give me the figures?
- 167... </i>

34
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:12,765
- Excuse me. Sorry to interrupt.
- What is it, Edgar?

35
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:17,005
We have a visual on the suspect.
He may be the Palmer shooter.

36
00:02:17,092 --> 00:02:20,803
- Were you able to make an ID?
- I think you should see for yourself.

37
00:02:20,894 --> 00:02:23,853
About an hour before
President Palmer was shot,

38
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:27,326
someone broke into the building
the sniper used.

39
00:02:27,416 --> 00:02:29,977
We have a frame grab from a security video.

40
00:02:30,057 --> 00:02:35,337
I ran it through a high-res filter,
so it may take a few seconds to render.

41
00:02:45,902 --> 00:02:47,814
Audrey.

42
00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:06,348
What is going on here, Jack?

43
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:09,582
They're setting me up
for Palmer's assassination.

44
00:03:09,671 --> 00:03:13,382
- Palmer's not even president. Why kill him?
- I don't know.

45
00:03:13,473 --> 00:03:15,782
You need to get
as far away from here as you can.

46
00:03:15,873 --> 00:03:19,106
No, I need to find out
who really killed President Palmer.

47
00:03:19,195 --> 00:03:21,072
How are you gonna do that?

48
00:03:21,156 --> 00:03:24,705
Start at the beginning,
investigate the original crime scene.

49
00:03:24,797 --> 00:03:29,110
David Palmer was visiting his brother. Maybe
he left something there that can help me.

50
00:03:29,198 --> 00:03:31,190
Palmer was killed an hour ago.

51
00:03:31,279 --> 00:03:34,238
The place will be crawling with
Secret Service, FBI, police.

52
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,313
I need schematics
and an interagency deployment grid.

53
00:03:37,401 --> 00:03:39,632
Can you get that for me or not?

54
00:03:40,442 --> 00:03:44,039
Yeah. I should be able
to log on remotely from the site.

55
00:03:44,123 --> 00:03:46,923
OK. Come on. Let's go.

56
00:03:51,207 --> 00:03:53,641
How could you kill that guy?

57
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:59,919
I'm sorry you had to see that, Derek.
Get in the van.

58
00:04:00,009 --> 00:04:01,921
I'm not going anywhere with you.

59
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:04,479
You're gonna do exactly what I tell you.

60
00:04:04,571 --> 00:04:06,767
Let go of me!

61
00:04:08,493 --> 00:04:11,007
Let's get something straight, kid.

62
00:04:11,094 --> 00:04:17,490
The only reason you're still conscious
is because I don't wanna carry you. Get in.

63
00:04:25,938 --> 00:04:29,137
Analysis indicates
the video hasn't been doctored.

64
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:33,419
Jack was in the building the sniper fired
from at the time Palmer was assassinated.

65
00:04:33,501 --> 00:04:36,175
That's impossible.
This whole thing is impossible.

66
00:04:36,262 --> 00:04:39,574
Bill, you were there when Jack was shot.
He had no pulse, no vitals.

67
00:04:39,663 --> 00:04:44,341
And I have no idea how Jack staged
his own death. But I understand his reasons.

68
00:04:44,425 --> 00:04:47,418
He was to be handed to the Chinese
to spend his life in prison.

69
00:04:47,506 --> 00:04:51,103
Yeah, but none of that explains
why Jack would want to kill David Palmer.

70
00:04:51,187 --> 00:04:53,827
I had Curtis pull the phone logs.

71
00:04:53,909 --> 00:04:58,301
Palmer, Tony and Michelle were all talking
to Jack right before he was supposedly killed.

72
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:03,512
Our working theory is that they conspired
to help Jack fake his own death.

73
00:05:03,592 --> 00:05:08,304
Now you're saying that Jack was behind
the attack on Tony and Michelle too?

74
00:05:08,394 --> 00:05:11,228
Why would Jack want to kill
the people who helped him?

75
00:05:11,315 --> 00:05:14,228
He may have stopped trusting them
to keep his secret.

76
00:05:14,316 --> 00:05:16,272
Jack would never murder his friends.

77
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:18,269
Audrey.

78
00:05:19,518 --> 00:05:21,908
I don't wanna believe Jack did this either.

79
00:05:21,999 --> 00:05:25,993
But right now it's the best explanation
for the evidence we have.

80
00:05:30,922 --> 00:05:32,833
I'm sorry.

81
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:37,360
- The White House needs to know.
- I'll call the president.

82
00:05:37,444 --> 00:05:39,163
Thanks.

83
00:05:39,245 --> 00:05:40,234
Bill.

84
00:05:40,325 --> 00:05:42,840
What is it, Curtis?

85
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:46,124
I had Adamson run data recovery
on Tony's phone records.

86
00:05:46,207 --> 00:05:49,359
Chloe was on those calls
with President Palmer and Tony.

87
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:51,360
Chloe knew Jack was alive?

88
00:05:51,449 --> 00:05:52,963
Apparently.

89
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:55,326
I called her in an hour ago.
She should be here.

90
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:57,880
I've been calling her,
but she's not answering.

91
00:05:57,972 --> 00:06:00,646
I wanted to run a locate,
but Spenser talked me out of it.

92
00:06:00,733 --> 00:06:03,486
- If anything happens to her, it's your fault.
- Stop.

93
00:06:03,574 --> 00:06:06,965
Have Adamson track her cell.
We need to get to her before Jack does.

94
00:06:07,054 --> 00:06:08,807
Put out an interagency alert.

95
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:11,854
Bauer's now the prime suspect
in Palmer's assassination.

96
00:06:11,937 --> 00:06:15,931
Emphasise that he's a former agent and
should be considered extremely dangerous.

97
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:25,897
Excuse me, sir.

98
00:06:25,982 --> 00:06:27,335
What is it, Walt?

99
00:06:27,422 --> 00:06:30,142
Mrs Logan called again.

100
00:06:31,864 --> 00:06:34,458
I can't keep stalling her about this Palmer call.

101
00:06:34,545 --> 00:06:37,379
Why would he call my wife
about a national security threat?

102
00:06:37,466 --> 00:06:41,585
That's what she says he wanted to talk to her
about - "a matter of national security. "

103
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:45,343
- Maybe if I investigated the phone call.
- Stay focused on the summit.

104
00:06:45,429 --> 00:06:50,630
I am, sir. Which is why we can't risk having
Mrs Logan obsess about this phone call.

105
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:54,102
Showing her the truth might help her
get on with her responsibilities.

106
00:06:54,192 --> 00:06:56,104
So what are you suggesting?

107
00:06:56,192 --> 00:07:00,949
If Palmer called her yesterday, our office
will have a recording of their conversation.

108
00:07:01,034 --> 00:07:03,913
- Get that for me.
- Yes, sir.

109
00:07:05,156 --> 00:07:06,748
And Walt?

110
00:07:06,836 --> 00:07:09,397
Thank you for doing this.

111
00:07:09,478 --> 00:07:13,836
<i> Mr President,
Audrey Raines is holding on line three. </i>

112
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:20,038
Ms Raines, President Logan.
You're also on with Walt Cummings.

113
00:07:20,121 --> 00:07:23,512
Sir, CTU has a suspect
in the assassination of President Palmer.

114
00:07:23,603 --> 00:07:25,241
Good.

115
00:07:25,323 --> 00:07:27,360
Who is it?

116
00:07:28,244 --> 00:07:30,155
Ms Raines?

117
00:07:32,685 --> 00:07:35,120
It's Jack Bauer, sir.

118
00:07:35,206 --> 00:07:38,405
- Bauer is dead.
- We've all been living under that assumption.

119
00:07:38,488 --> 00:07:41,048
I don't understand.
What makes you think it's Bauer?

120
00:07:41,129 --> 00:07:44,041
CTU has verified surveillance video
placing Jack Bauer

121
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:48,171
at the same time in the same building
as the sniper who killed President Palmer.

122
00:07:48,251 --> 00:07:50,447
Audrey, this is Walt Cummings.

123
00:07:50,532 --> 00:07:53,923
Let me get clear on this. Are you saying
that Bauer shot David Palmer?

124
00:07:54,013 --> 00:07:56,050
We're proceeding under that assumption.

125
00:07:56,134 --> 00:07:57,931
Why? For what possible reason?

126
00:07:58,015 --> 00:08:00,405
David Palmer might have known
Bauer was alive,

127
00:08:00,496 --> 00:08:04,968
knowledge he shared with three CTU agents,
all of whom were targeted in the last hour.

128
00:08:05,057 --> 00:08:08,892
He does have a history of insubordination,
irrational behaviour, addiction.

129
00:08:08,979 --> 00:08:12,734
Jack Bauer has a history of
great service to this country.

130
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,776
How does this affect the summit?

131
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:18,741
We're recommending that you delay
or reschedule until Jack is apprehended.

132
00:08:18,822 --> 00:08:21,815
Ms Raines, you have a suspect. Find him.

133
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:24,057
Yes, sir.

134
00:08:25,345 --> 00:08:28,622
Sir. President Suvarov
arrives within the hour.

135
00:08:28,706 --> 00:08:32,222
Should we inform his security chief
that he's a potential target?

136
00:08:32,307 --> 00:08:33,423
No.

137
00:08:33,507 --> 00:08:37,821
I want this information limited to those who
are involved in the manhunt for Jack Bauer.

138
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:40,299
- Understood?
- Yes, sir.

139
00:08:45,671 --> 00:08:47,743
I found Haas.

140
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:52,793
- He and his men are all dead.
- How did this happen?

141
00:08:52,874 --> 00:08:56,789
I'm not sure. The last time I spoke to Haas,
he was about to move on Bauer.

142
00:08:56,876 --> 00:08:58,389
Any sign of Bauer now?

143
00:08:58,476 --> 00:09:01,629
No. I'll dispatch a team and track him.
We'll have him in 24 hours.

144
00:09:01,718 --> 00:09:07,032
No. Let CTU find Bauer. Once they have him
in custody, we'll take him out.

145
00:09:07,119 --> 00:09:09,315
Bauer won't impede the operation?

146
00:09:09,401 --> 00:09:11,517
He won't have a chance.

147
00:09:11,602 --> 00:09:14,162
We launch in less than an hour.

148
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:33,404
Their hardware's military spec. Fragmentation
grenades, percussion grenades.

149
00:09:34,569 --> 00:09:36,526
There's a comm unit we can use.

150
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:38,885
Who are these people?

151
00:09:41,172 --> 00:09:44,722
- Yeah?
- Frank. Please tell me what's going on.

152
00:09:44,813 --> 00:09:49,013
Diane, I know it's hard, but please try not
to worry. Derek is fine. Where are you now?

153
00:09:49,094 --> 00:09:52,167
Um... I'm about a half-hour outside of LA.

154
00:09:52,255 --> 00:09:54,690
- Just tell me where to meet you.
- I don't know yet.

155
00:09:54,777 --> 00:09:57,497
Head towards the city.
I'll get back to you when I can.

156
00:09:57,577 --> 00:10:00,298
- Can I talk to him?
- Of course. Hold on.

157
00:10:01,499 --> 00:10:03,854
It's your mother. Talk to her.

158
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,493
<i>- Mom?
- Derek?</i>

159
00:10:06,581 --> 00:10:08,139
Are you OK?

160
00:10:08,221 --> 00:10:09,860
- I'm all right.
- Are you sure?

161
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:12,093
<i>- We're about a block away.
- Who was that?</i>

162
00:10:12,183 --> 00:10:15,221
- Say goodbye to your mother.
- I have to hang up now, Mom.

163
00:10:15,304 --> 00:10:17,944
<i>- Don't worry. I'm fine. 
- Derek, I love you.</i>

164
00:10:18,024 --> 00:10:19,663
Yeah, me too.

165
00:10:19,746 --> 00:10:22,784
Give me the phone. Get to the back of the van.

166
00:10:22,866 --> 00:10:24,300
Go!

167
00:10:26,188 --> 00:10:30,307
While security agencies are remaining
hushed, speculation begins to grow.

168
00:10:30,389 --> 00:10:33,223
We're told that that speculation
will not be addressed

169
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:36,702
because the government says
security is of utmost importance.

170
00:10:36,792 --> 00:10:39,353
Behind me is the Los Angeles
apartment building

171
00:10:39,432 --> 00:10:43,143
where President Palmer was
assassinated a little more than an hour ago.

172
00:10:43,234 --> 00:10:48,025
- You can also see Americans of all ages...
- Pull up, please.

173
00:10:48,116 --> 00:10:50,028
Credentials?

174
00:10:57,119 --> 00:10:59,475
All right. Go on through.

175
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,676
Let her through.

176
00:11:32,212 --> 00:11:34,249
We're clear.

177
00:11:38,013 --> 00:11:40,847
Come on up front.

178
00:11:43,856 --> 00:11:46,211
Hold the light on the bag.

179
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,378
Can you get a wireless access point?

180
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:03,935
I'm reading the agents' transponders. I can
track their locations to within three feet.

181
00:12:08,865 --> 00:12:12,302
Jack, there are 167 agents
in and around the location,

182
00:12:12,386 --> 00:12:14,742
25 of them
in Wayne Palmer's apartment alone.

183
00:12:14,827 --> 00:12:20,938
I know. That's why we'd better hope that this
is the last place they're gonna look for me.

184
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:28,261
Testing, one, two.
Testing, one, two, three. OK.

185
00:12:28,352 --> 00:12:33,586
This is a field ops communication unit.
Just put it in your ear and we're set to go.

186
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:41,989
Derek, put out the light.

187
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:58,718
Officer. I live here. I was told that I needed to
check with one of the agents to get clearance.

188
00:12:58,803 --> 00:13:02,717
- Can you help with that?
- All right, let me check.

189
00:13:04,604 --> 00:13:07,483
- What...?
- Relax. He's really good at this.

190
00:13:11,848 --> 00:13:13,839
Are you sure he's OK?

191
00:13:13,928 --> 00:13:15,441
Yeah.

192
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:21,322
I think.

193
00:13:37,256 --> 00:13:40,294
<i>- Chloe, do you copy?
- Yeah.</i>

194
00:13:52,662 --> 00:13:56,178
<i>Wayne Palmer's apartment is the penthouse. </i>

195
00:13:59,424 --> 00:14:01,495
I'm going up now.

196
00:14:05,546 --> 00:14:09,336
There are four agents waiting at the lobby.
Hold off on going up if you can.

197
00:14:12,189 --> 00:14:14,305
Too late.

198
00:14:24,273 --> 00:14:29,190
at the time of the assassination
and assemble at a secure location.

199
00:14:35,398 --> 00:14:40,075
They need to be confiscated
for frame-by-frame analysis downtown.

200
00:15:01,246 --> 00:15:03,079
<i> I'm entering the apartment. </i>

201
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:08,361
<i> Most of the agents are in the living
room. That must be where Palmer was shot. </i>

202
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:13,809
There are two rooms to the north, 15 feet,
probably bedrooms. They're clear. No agents.

203
00:15:51,665 --> 00:15:54,133
This first room is a study.

204
00:15:54,225 --> 00:15:58,459
<i>- Let me know if anyone comes this way.
- Will do, Jack. </i>

205
00:15:59,668 --> 00:16:02,102
You keep calling him Jack.

206
00:16:02,188 --> 00:16:05,545
He told my mother and I his name's Frank.

207
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:08,222
Who is he really?

208
00:16:08,311 --> 00:16:11,668
Jack Bauer. Until a year and a half ago
he worked for the government.

209
00:16:11,751 --> 00:16:14,108
Is that why we're
where the president was killed?

210
00:16:14,193 --> 00:16:17,072
Please don't ask me any more questions.

211
00:16:17,954 --> 00:16:23,030
Can't you at least tell me why
he had to pretend he was someone else?

212
00:16:27,518 --> 00:16:31,910
Certain people thought the best way to
cover up their mistakes was to get rid of Jack.

213
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:33,797
You mean kill him?

214
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,074
Yes.

215
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:39,041
Jack gave up everything and everyone
in his life, including his daughter.

216
00:16:39,122 --> 00:16:41,432
He has a daughter?

217
00:16:42,362 --> 00:16:47,518
<i>- I've already told you more than I should've.
- I have a computer in the study booted up. </i>

218
00:16:47,604 --> 00:16:49,722
President Palmer had a user account.

219
00:16:49,805 --> 00:16:51,558
<i>- Is it password secured?
- No.</i>

220
00:16:51,646 --> 00:16:54,684
Only one of the files is encrypted.
That's where we'll look.

221
00:16:54,767 --> 00:16:58,477
Give me the computer's IP address.
I'll upload a decryption program to it.

222
00:16:58,568 --> 00:16:59,557
Hold on.

223
00:16:59,649 --> 00:17:05,169
292.162.12.2.

224
00:17:07,372 --> 00:17:11,048
- Someone's at the door.
- Not according to the deployment grid.

225
00:17:18,016 --> 00:17:22,329
- Do not raise your voice.
- You son of a bitch. You killed my brother.

226
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:25,012
Mr Palmer, you know I didn't do that.

227
00:17:25,098 --> 00:17:28,091
Any evidence they showed you
against me has been fabricated.

228
00:17:28,179 --> 00:17:33,938
I served your brother for years.
I would have gladly given my life for his.

229
00:17:34,021 --> 00:17:36,456
He was my friend.

230
00:17:38,143 --> 00:17:42,854
The only reason that I am here is to try and
figure out why and how he was assassinated.

231
00:17:42,945 --> 00:17:47,736
- I was hoping to find clues on that computer.
- Why don't you ask Secret Service to help?

232
00:17:47,826 --> 00:17:53,107
I'm being set up. Whoever's behind this
has planted evidence making me the shooter.

233
00:17:53,188 --> 00:17:55,464
It's useless to try to convince the authorities.

234
00:17:55,549 --> 00:17:57,380
And you think you'll convince me?

235
00:17:57,470 --> 00:18:01,828
If I killed your brother, why didn't I kill you
when you walked through the door?

236
00:18:01,912 --> 00:18:05,791
Think about this, Wayne.
Why would I be here?

237
00:18:09,434 --> 00:18:12,473
Please. I need your help.

238
00:18:13,075 --> 00:18:17,707
Jack, how do you expect me to believe you
under these circumstances?

239
00:18:21,998 --> 00:18:25,151
- Take the gun.
- Jack, what are you doing?

240
00:18:26,761 --> 00:18:28,479
Take the gun.

241
00:18:59,812 --> 00:19:02,327
<i>... after two terms in the house
and one in the senate,</i>

242
00:19:02,413 --> 00:19:06,374
<i>David Palmer was elected president
with a 60% plurality. </i>

243
00:19:06,454 --> 00:19:08,685
Here you are, Mrs Logan.

244
00:19:10,896 --> 00:19:15,255
David and I first got to know each other
when he was elected to Congress.

245
00:19:15,337 --> 00:19:18,171
He and Charles
never saw eye to eye politically.

246
00:19:18,259 --> 00:19:22,253
David never let that
get in the way of our friendship.

247
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:25,857
Oh... That picture's
from his inauguration.

248
00:19:25,941 --> 00:19:29,652
At the ball, I was one of the first people
David asked to dance.

249
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:34,900
- We need a few more minutes with your hair.
- I know. I can do it myself.

250
00:19:34,984 --> 00:19:39,616
- I'm just trying to help.
- Oh, I'm sorry, Evelyn. I know. I'm sorry.

251
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:43,698
Mrs Logan. May I... have a word?

252
00:19:43,788 --> 00:19:45,779
Of course.

253
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:51,261
The president asked me
to look into the call from David Palmer.

254
00:19:51,351 --> 00:19:54,628
I was beginning to think
you were ignoring me.

255
00:19:54,712 --> 00:19:57,386
- So when did this call take place?
- Last night.

256
00:19:57,472 --> 00:20:01,673
It woke me up. I had fallen asleep watching
the news, so somewhere between 10 and 11.

257
00:20:01,754 --> 00:20:05,192
I'll have someone pull up the call
from the audio archives.

258
00:20:06,676 --> 00:20:07,825
Walt.

259
00:20:08,716 --> 00:20:11,915
He doesn't believe me, does he? Charles.

260
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:15,996
He thinks I'm making the whole thing up.

261
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:21,034
- I wouldn't say that, Mrs Logan.
- Well, of course you wouldn't say it.

262
00:20:22,282 --> 00:20:25,719
- Mrs Logan...
- Walt, you can go now.

263
00:20:36,007 --> 00:20:39,967
Did your brother say or do anything
out of the ordinary before he was shot?

264
00:20:40,048 --> 00:20:42,847
He'd been distracted
ever since he came to Los Angeles.

265
00:20:42,929 --> 00:20:45,808
I finally called him on it this morning.

266
00:20:45,891 --> 00:20:47,528
What'd he say?

267
00:20:47,611 --> 00:20:51,207
He never had the chance
to say anything, Jack.

268
00:20:52,573 --> 00:20:55,452
The decryption's done. You can open the file.

269
00:20:55,533 --> 00:20:57,923
OK, I'm going into it now.

270
00:21:01,056 --> 00:21:05,495
That's the first chapter of his memoir. It
makes no sense. Why would he encrypt that?

271
00:21:05,577 --> 00:21:09,891
- There are print-outs of it all over the place.
- Maybe he hid some information in it.

272
00:21:09,979 --> 00:21:13,859
We'll compare this to the print-out,
see if he added or changed anything.

273
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:16,580
I've got one right here.

274
00:21:18,862 --> 00:21:20,056
No...

275
00:21:21,182 --> 00:21:26,464
- You haven't sent the file allocations. Why?
- I need a higher-level access code.

276
00:21:26,544 --> 00:21:29,140
- If you're upset about me and Chloe...
- I don't care.

277
00:21:29,226 --> 00:21:32,185
If you hadn't left her on her own,
maybe she'd be OK now.

278
00:21:32,267 --> 00:21:34,736
Don't you think I know that?

279
00:21:37,508 --> 00:21:40,866
Look, you're just making it harder
for me to do my job.

280
00:21:42,271 --> 00:21:46,105
Use Chloe's access code. JJ72.
You won't get firewalled with it.

281
00:21:46,192 --> 00:21:47,307
Thank you.

282
00:21:51,594 --> 00:21:53,789
SYSTEM ERROR

283
00:21:55,675 --> 00:21:56,870
- Edgar.
- What?

284
00:21:56,956 --> 00:22:00,029
This is weird. I tried logging in
under Chloe's access code.

285
00:22:00,117 --> 00:22:02,552
The system says I'm already signed in.

286
00:22:02,637 --> 00:22:04,390
Let me see.

287
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:10,593
- Chloe's logged in remotely.
- Are you sure it's her?

288
00:22:10,681 --> 00:22:13,958
Yes. See the way the traffic's
redirected to an external socket?

289
00:22:14,042 --> 00:22:16,796
Even I don't know how to do that.

290
00:22:16,882 --> 00:22:19,033
Then she's alive.

291
00:22:28,887 --> 00:22:30,003
Buchanan.

292
00:22:30,087 --> 00:22:33,718
<i>- Sir, it's Edgar. I think we can find Chloe. 
- How?</i>

293
00:22:33,809 --> 00:22:37,120
She's accessing our system to a laptop.
I'm running a locate now.

294
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:40,009
- What's she using the system to do?
- All I can see from here

295
00:22:40,091 --> 00:22:43,323
is she's tracking Secret Service
and FBI deployments.

296
00:22:43,412 --> 00:22:45,529
The locate came back.

297
00:22:45,613 --> 00:22:47,683
She's at Wayne Palmer's building.

298
00:22:47,774 --> 00:22:51,006
Signal's faint.
She could be in a garage under the building.

299
00:22:51,095 --> 00:22:53,007
Let me know if she changes location.

300
00:22:53,095 --> 00:22:56,533
Why would Chloe be at the scene
of Palmer's murder tracking agents?

301
00:22:56,617 --> 00:22:59,769
She wouldn't be.
Unless someone was forcing her.

302
00:22:59,858 --> 00:23:01,291
What do you mean?

303
00:23:01,379 --> 00:23:03,768
Maybe Jack left evidence he needs to erase.

304
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:06,328
Surrounded by all those agents?

305
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:08,538
Jack can explain when we apprehend him.

306
00:23:08,621 --> 00:23:13,822
Bill Buchanan at CTU. I need to speak to
the Secret Service field director immediately.

307
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:34,262
<i>- Yes?
- Have you left yet?</i>

308
00:23:34,351 --> 00:23:36,706
We were delayed.
We're still loading the truck.

309
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:40,422
- You should be on your way.
- We'll be there in 20 minutes, as planned.

310
00:23:40,513 --> 00:23:43,073
Call me when you're approaching.

311
00:23:45,123 --> 00:23:49,436
Wait. Stop, stop. Right there. He added
something in the middle of a sentence.

312
00:23:49,524 --> 00:23:52,437
A... a name and an address. There.

313
00:23:52,525 --> 00:23:55,996
Chevensky - 16 Transport Way.
Did you get that? It looks like an address.

314
00:23:56,087 --> 00:23:58,760
Yes. Transport Way is a street
at the Ontario airport.

315
00:23:58,848 --> 00:24:02,125
Check all flights into Ontario.
Look for a passenger Chevensky.

316
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:04,359
Try and make the connection.

317
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:08,205
Jack, Secret Service
is changing its deployment.

318
00:24:09,891 --> 00:24:11,086
How?

319
00:24:11,172 --> 00:24:13,368
A lot of agents are moving into the building.

320
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:15,126
I'm on my way down.

321
00:24:15,214 --> 00:24:17,045
They know that I'm here.

322
00:24:17,134 --> 00:24:21,573
- Let me help you get out of here, Jack.
- No. You can't risk being connected to me.

323
00:24:21,656 --> 00:24:27,129
And until we know who to trust, you can't tell
anybody what we found. Do you understand?

324
00:24:27,218 --> 00:24:31,178
I'm gonna do everything I can
to find out who did this to your brother.

325
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:33,330
I'll be in touch.

326
00:24:53,187 --> 00:24:55,179
Chloe, I need another way out of here.

327
00:24:55,268 --> 00:24:57,260
Checking.

328
00:24:58,109 --> 00:25:01,102
Across the hall, through the kitchen.
One agent at the door.

329
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:03,385
Copy that.

330
00:25:42,205 --> 00:25:45,562
I'm in the elevator. Where are they
concentrating their agents?

331
00:25:47,166 --> 00:25:52,117
They cut off access to my grid. I don't know
where the agents are. They were in the lobby.

332
00:25:54,009 --> 00:25:56,922
I'm getting out on the second floor.

333
00:26:20,378 --> 00:26:22,335
Come on, Jack.

334
00:26:27,741 --> 00:26:32,133
- What'd you get for me on Chevensky?
- He's a baggage supervisor at the airport.

335
00:26:32,223 --> 00:26:33,941
Jack Bauer!

336
00:26:34,023 --> 00:26:36,060
Agent O'Brian!

337
00:26:36,144 --> 00:26:38,978
The perimeter is sealed. There is no way out.

338
00:26:40,506 --> 00:26:43,977
Step into view with your hands in the air.

339
00:26:48,828 --> 00:26:51,104
We know you're down here.

340
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:55,025
Step into view with your hands in the air.

341
00:26:55,111 --> 00:26:57,626
We got a visual!

342
00:27:00,873 --> 00:27:03,911
Do not shoot! We need them alive!

343
00:27:05,355 --> 00:27:07,266
No one fire!

344
00:27:11,156 --> 00:27:13,274
Don't fire!

345
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:21,590
- Do not fire!
- Get out of the vehicle.

346
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:24,071
Step out of the vehicle.

347
00:27:24,162 --> 00:27:26,197
Check the back. Get the side.

348
00:27:26,282 --> 00:27:28,956
Step to your left. Get down on your knees.

349
00:27:29,043 --> 00:27:30,636
Cuff her.

350
00:27:30,724 --> 00:27:32,362
Open the back.

351
00:27:33,924 --> 00:27:36,486
Bauer's not here. Secure the area.

352
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:52,610
Get in. Give me my bag.

353
00:28:01,695 --> 00:28:03,686
Come on.

354
00:28:05,576 --> 00:28:07,568
Got it.

355
00:28:39,869 --> 00:28:40,904
Frank?

356
00:28:40,989 --> 00:28:44,619
Yeah, it's me. Listen, Derek is all right.
I just need to know where you are.

357
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:47,271
I'm, uh, on the 210 at the 10.

358
00:28:47,351 --> 00:28:50,185
OK, I want you to take the 10 east
to the Ontario airport.

359
00:28:50,272 --> 00:28:52,867
Go to the parking lot in front of the terminal.

360
00:28:52,953 --> 00:28:55,593
I'll meet you on the west side of it.
Understand?

361
00:28:55,674 --> 00:28:57,393
Yeah. Yeah.

362
00:28:57,474 --> 00:28:59,511
Diane, listen to me.

363
00:29:00,515 --> 00:29:03,270
I am so sorry that I got you involved in this.

364
00:29:03,357 --> 00:29:06,349
But it's gonna be all right.
I'll be there in a few minutes.

365
00:29:06,438 --> 00:29:07,473
<i>OK.</i>

366
00:29:07,558 --> 00:29:09,550
OK, thanks.

367
00:29:15,401 --> 00:29:17,120
This is Agent Jennings.

368
00:29:17,202 --> 00:29:21,196
There's no sign of Jack Bauer yet, but we've
apprehended your agent Chloe O'Brian.

369
00:29:21,283 --> 00:29:23,878
She tried to escape our agents
and leave the building.

370
00:29:23,964 --> 00:29:28,118
- You're telling me she wasn't under duress?
- Not as far as I can tell.

371
00:29:28,766 --> 00:29:30,165
Put her on the phone.

372
00:29:30,247 --> 00:29:32,317
Uncuff her.

373
00:29:34,048 --> 00:29:36,688
Bill Buchanan wants to talk to you.

374
00:29:37,449 --> 00:29:39,645
- Hi.
- Chloe, what the hell's going on?

375
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:43,519
Jack's being framed to cover up
the real reason Palmer was assassinated.

376
00:29:43,611 --> 00:29:46,365
- Says Jack?
- Says the man who killed Palmer.

377
00:29:46,453 --> 00:29:48,409
I heard his dying confession.

378
00:29:48,493 --> 00:29:51,930
You'll find his body
at the refinery at Variel and Topanga.

379
00:29:52,014 --> 00:29:55,167
Do you have evidence
that Palmer's death is to do with the summit?

380
00:29:55,255 --> 00:29:58,293
- No. Jack's trying to figure that out.
- How? Where is he?

381
00:29:59,377 --> 00:30:01,528
- I can't tell you.
- Why not?

382
00:30:01,618 --> 00:30:04,530
I don't think you believe him.
You're trying to arrest him.

383
00:30:04,619 --> 00:30:09,330
Chloe, I'm not gonna ask you again.
I'm ordering you to tell me where Jack is.

384
00:30:11,861 --> 00:30:14,217
I'm sorry. I'd like to tell you but I can't.

385
00:30:14,303 --> 00:30:16,134
Chloe!

386
00:30:16,904 --> 00:30:19,862
- Sir.
- Bring her back to CTU.

387
00:30:21,584 --> 00:30:23,941
Curtis, take a team to the refinery.

388
00:30:24,026 --> 00:30:29,055
Edgar, make sure Chloe goes into
a holding cell when she gets back.

389
00:30:32,909 --> 00:30:35,583
That woman, Chloe...

390
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:40,107
she told me some stuff
about what you used to do.

391
00:30:43,393 --> 00:30:45,954
Yeah, well, she shouldn't have.

392
00:30:49,075 --> 00:30:53,547
Why did you have to lie?
Couldn't you have just told us the truth?

393
00:30:54,156 --> 00:30:59,438
First of all, you have to understand I never
thought anything like this could ever happen.

394
00:31:00,719 --> 00:31:03,280
After your mother rented me that room,

395
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:08,314
I started to remember what it was like
to have a family.

396
00:31:10,523 --> 00:31:13,196
How nice it was.

397
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:20,483
I started to believe that a guy like me
could actually get a second chance.

398
00:31:20,566 --> 00:31:23,400
I know you don't believe this now...

399
00:31:25,048 --> 00:31:27,437
but I really do care about you.

400
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:33,520
And I care about your mother.

401
00:31:36,732 --> 00:31:39,725
I hope one day you can understand that.

402
00:31:46,815 --> 00:31:48,215
Charles.

403
00:31:48,296 --> 00:31:50,730
- Evelyn said you wanted to talk to me.
- I do.

404
00:31:50,817 --> 00:31:55,210
Did Walt find the tape of the phone call?
I told him approximately when it took place.

405
00:31:55,298 --> 00:31:57,860
- Why don't we sit down?
- I don't want to sit down.

406
00:31:57,939 --> 00:31:59,692
All right.

407
00:32:01,701 --> 00:32:04,091
Don't be concerned
that there's any connection

408
00:32:04,182 --> 00:32:07,095
between David's death
and the phone call he made to you.

409
00:32:07,183 --> 00:32:11,177
He said it was a matter of national security.
Those were his exact words.

410
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:15,657
- There's got to be a connection, of course.
- There isn't.

411
00:32:15,745 --> 00:32:18,739
David was killed by
an unstable ex-CTU agent.

412
00:32:18,827 --> 00:32:22,980
This was not a conspiracy, this was
one man acting out some kind of grudge.

413
00:32:23,068 --> 00:32:25,185
Did you hear the call?

414
00:32:25,269 --> 00:32:27,226
Can we just drop this?

415
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:29,427
Did you or didn't you hear it?

416
00:32:39,394 --> 00:32:43,547
<i>- Hello?
- Martha, it's David Palmer. Did I wake you?</i>

417
00:32:43,636 --> 00:32:46,549
<i>No, no, David. Not at all. What's going on?</i>

418
00:32:46,637 --> 00:32:50,551
<i> I need to talk to you. 
It's hardly a matter of national security,</i>

419
00:32:50,638 --> 00:32:54,552
<i>but I'm hosting a charity dinner next month
for the Art In Action programme. </i>

420
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:58,759
<i>- No. That's not what he said. No, that's not it.
- I would like you to be there. </i>

421
00:32:58,841 --> 00:33:02,232
No, that is not it. That is not it.
Charles, that's not it. Let me...

422
00:33:02,323 --> 00:33:04,075
Martha, listen!

423
00:33:04,164 --> 00:33:07,122
<i>- We'll talk more in the morning, then. 
- Thank you. </i>

424
00:33:07,204 --> 00:33:09,514
<i>- Of course. 
- Send the president my best. </i>

425
00:33:09,605 --> 00:33:11,642
- No. That's not what he said.
- Yes, it is.

426
00:33:11,725 --> 00:33:13,399
No, that is a trick.

427
00:33:13,487 --> 00:33:15,125
- I am not crazy.
- Listen to me.

428
00:33:15,207 --> 00:33:18,598
- I know what I heard!
- Martha! Martha! Listen to me.

429
00:33:18,689 --> 00:33:21,124
I spoke to Dr Hill.

430
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:26,207
He said if you are not consistent with your
medication you can become disoriented.

431
00:33:26,291 --> 00:33:29,523
Your memory can be affected.

432
00:33:32,493 --> 00:33:35,293
- He said that?
- Yes.

433
00:33:38,056 --> 00:33:41,174
That's why you remember
something different.

434
00:33:41,256 --> 00:33:45,251
I know you don't like
how these pills make you feel,

435
00:33:45,338 --> 00:33:47,853
but you need to take them.

436
00:33:54,461 --> 00:33:57,772
If Jack was responsible for Palmer's death,
why would Chloe cover him?

437
00:33:57,862 --> 00:34:01,903
It doesn't make sense. There's something else
going on here and we're missing it.

438
00:34:01,984 --> 00:34:05,375
NSA intercepted some chatter
identifying the summit as a target.

439
00:34:05,465 --> 00:34:08,822
We're sourcing it now,
but the reliability's approaching 95%.

440
00:34:08,907 --> 00:34:11,216
- Time frame?
- Within the next 15 minutes.

441
00:34:11,307 --> 00:34:13,776
That's when Suvarov's scheduled to land.

442
00:34:13,869 --> 00:34:16,178
Logan said he won't postpone this summit.

443
00:34:16,269 --> 00:34:19,468
In light of this, he may not have a choice.

444
00:34:21,631 --> 00:34:24,066
<i>- Operations. 
- Put me through to Mike Novick.</i>

445
00:34:28,274 --> 00:34:30,994
<i> Suvarov's helicopter
is leaving the air base. </i>

446
00:34:31,074 --> 00:34:34,227
<i>- His arrival at the retreat is on schedule. 
- As are we.</i>

447
00:34:34,316 --> 00:34:38,549
We'll go dark now.
No communication until after your strike.

448
00:34:38,637 --> 00:34:41,869
- I will monitor your progress from here.
- Understood.

449
00:34:41,958 --> 00:34:43,711
<i>Udachi. </i>

450
00:34:48,561 --> 00:34:50,598
- Mr President?
- Yeah, Mike, what is it?

451
00:34:50,681 --> 00:34:52,513
CTU has confirmed intelligence

452
00:34:52,602 --> 00:34:56,391
suggesting President Suvarov's helicopter
will be targeted.

453
00:34:56,483 --> 00:35:01,514
- How good is this intelligence?
- Very good. They want you to reschedule.

454
00:35:01,606 --> 00:35:05,236
No. I've told them, I'm telling you.
I will not postpone this summit.

455
00:35:05,327 --> 00:35:08,126
Then at least have Suvarov
alter his arrival plan.

456
00:35:08,208 --> 00:35:11,484
His chopper can land at a different site.
He can come by motorcade.

457
00:35:11,569 --> 00:35:13,526
The risk would be reduced.

458
00:35:13,609 --> 00:35:16,283
And the impact of his arrival
would also be reduced.

459
00:35:16,371 --> 00:35:19,011
The media is waiting
for a landing in five minutes.

460
00:35:19,091 --> 00:35:21,448
- Mr President...
- I don't wanna hear it, Walt.

461
00:35:21,532 --> 00:35:27,610
It's up to Secret Service and the air force
to protect our airspace. Make sure they do it.

462
00:35:52,543 --> 00:35:54,933
There's your mom.

463
00:35:55,024 --> 00:35:56,538
Hey.

464
00:35:58,626 --> 00:36:01,699
I'm sorry about the way I treated you earlier.

465
00:36:02,668 --> 00:36:04,863
You're a good kid.

466
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:11,980
Go get your mom.

467
00:36:13,912 --> 00:36:16,507
- Mom?
- My God.

468
00:36:18,993 --> 00:36:19,948
Oh!

469
00:36:20,033 --> 00:36:24,074
Oh, are you OK? I was so worried.

470
00:36:30,678 --> 00:36:32,828
- Things are fine.
- Are you sure?

471
00:36:32,918 --> 00:36:34,910
I'm fine.

472
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:39,948
You gotta tell me right now
what the hell is going on here, Frank.

473
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:42,874
My name's not Frank. It's Jack Bauer.

474
00:36:43,922 --> 00:36:47,917
I lied to you. I lied to you about a lot of things.

475
00:36:48,003 --> 00:36:52,874
And I'll explain as soon as I can, but right now
you and Derek need to go to this address.

476
00:36:52,965 --> 00:36:56,164
- CTU?
- Counter Terrorist Unit. I used to work there.

477
00:36:56,246 --> 00:37:00,560
You need to ask for a man named
Bill Buchanan. Tell him I sent you.

478
00:37:01,649 --> 00:37:03,640
I'm sorry.

479
00:37:04,849 --> 00:37:07,603
I have to go.

480
00:37:07,691 --> 00:37:10,650
When we get there, what do we tell him?

481
00:37:11,932 --> 00:37:14,322
Tell him the truth.

482
00:37:30,979 --> 00:37:35,418
- Where is the baggage claim supervisor?
- Down that hall, to the left.

483
00:37:40,542 --> 00:37:43,535
DOD is giving us the all clear
on the airspace on the retreat.

484
00:37:43,624 --> 00:37:45,899
<i>... unprecedented levels of security. </i>

485
00:37:45,985 --> 00:37:50,377
<i>The president admits Suvarov was given
an air escort of F-16 fighter jets... </i>

486
00:37:50,466 --> 00:37:54,824
- Any word from our agents on the ground?
- OK. I'm all quiet so far.

487
00:37:55,388 --> 00:37:58,938
If they're going to attack the helicopter,
it's going to be now.

488
00:37:59,029 --> 00:38:01,544
<i> The helicopter touching down now. </i>

489
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:04,668
<i>It will be only moments
before Presidents Logan and Suvarov</i>

490
00:38:04,751 --> 00:38:06,947
<i>will meet face to face for the first time. </i>

491
00:38:07,032 --> 00:38:09,751
<i>There was speculation
the summit might be postponed</i>

492
00:38:09,833 --> 00:38:12,064
<i>following the death of President Palmer,</i>

493
00:38:12,154 --> 00:38:14,794
<i>but President Logan said the late president</i>

494
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:18,551
<i>would not have wanted a vital step
towards international cooperation... </i>

495
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,991
Mr President. A pleasure to see you.

496
00:38:32,081 --> 00:38:36,872
<i> President Logan, smiling broadly,
extends a greeting to his Russian counterpart. </i>

497
00:38:36,962 --> 00:38:39,080
Our intel must've been wrong.

498
00:38:39,163 --> 00:38:42,202
<i>... relief that Suvarov
arrived without incident. </i>

499
00:38:42,284 --> 00:38:45,881
<i>The ceremony will be carried live
throughout the world... </i>

500
00:39:05,813 --> 00:39:08,931
- Mom, do you see those men?
- Yeah.

501
00:39:11,094 --> 00:39:13,928
That's where Jack went.

502
00:39:19,098 --> 00:39:22,694
Something's wrong. I have to warn Jack.

503
00:39:22,779 --> 00:39:26,568
Derek, where are you going?
Come back here. Derek, come back here!

504
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:28,014
Derek!

505
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:30,934
- Get back in your...
- Come back! I gotta get my son.

506
00:39:31,022 --> 00:39:33,093
Derek! Come back here!

507
00:39:33,182 --> 00:39:36,494
- Please go to your car. Get back in.
- I've gotta get my son! Derek!

508
00:40:08,755 --> 00:40:10,348
Chevensky.

509
00:40:11,277 --> 00:40:15,510
- Why was President Palmer killed?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

510
00:40:15,598 --> 00:40:18,830
You will tell me.
It's just a question of how much it hurts.

511
00:40:32,845 --> 00:40:34,437
No!

512
00:41:01,414 --> 00:41:03,849
Get on the floor! Go!

513
00:41:12,658 --> 00:41:14,650
Quiet!

514
00:41:14,859 --> 00:41:16,451
Quiet!

515
00:41:20,101 --> 00:41:25,257
You will not be harmed as long as
your president complies with our wishes.

516
00:41:34,187 --> 00:41:35,905
Derek!

517
00:41:37,267 --> 00:41:38,781
- Derek!
- Ma'am, stop.

518
00:41:38,867 --> 00:41:43,545
I'm trying to find my son in there!
My son...! I have to get my son!

519
00:41:55,634 --> 00:41:58,229
<i>I have dealt with the Martha Logan situation. </i>

520
00:41:58,315 --> 00:42:00,670
<i>- She's not going to be a problem?
- No. </i>

521
00:42:00,756 --> 00:42:04,193
<i>I altered the tape of the phone call
before the president heard it. </i>

522
00:42:04,277 --> 00:42:08,955
There's no evidence on my end that Palmer
was trying to warn her about the attack.

523
00:42:09,039 --> 00:42:10,711
Good.

524
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,519
The terminal and the hostages are secure.

525
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:19,120
It'll only be a matter of time
till the president is notified of the demands.
