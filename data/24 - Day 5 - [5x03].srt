1
00:00:14,107 --> 00:00:17,705
Why would David Palmer call my wife
about a national security threat?

2
00:00:17,791 --> 00:00:20,228
We can't risk having
Mrs. Logan obsess about this call.

3
00:00:20,313 --> 00:00:24,834
If Palmer called her yesterday, our office
will have a recording of their conversation.

4
00:00:24,919 --> 00:00:26,069
Get that for me.

5
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,996
Don't be concerned
that there's any connection

6
00:00:29,083 --> 00:00:32,317
between David's death
and the phone call he made to you.

7
00:00:32,406 --> 00:00:36,324
He said it was a matter of national security.
Those were his exact words.

8
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:38,370
<i>Martha, it's David Palmer.</i>

9
00:00:39,654 --> 00:00:43,129
<i>I need to talk to you.
It's hardly a matter of national security.</i>

10
00:00:44,059 --> 00:00:47,420
- No, that is not what he said.
- Yes, it is.

11
00:00:47,783 --> 00:00:49,981
<i>I've dealt with the Martha Logan situation.</i>

12
00:00:50,067 --> 00:00:53,027
<i>I altered the tape of the phone call
before the president heard it.</i>

13
00:00:53,109 --> 00:00:57,027
There's no evidence on my end that Palmer
was trying to warn her about the attack.

14
00:00:57,355 --> 00:01:01,796
Sir, I think we can find Chloe.
She's accessing our system to a laptop.

15
00:01:03,201 --> 00:01:07,199
- What'd you get for me on Chevensky?
- He's a baggage supervisor at the airport.

16
00:01:07,285 --> 00:01:08,879
Jack Bauer.

17
00:01:08,967 --> 00:01:10,561
Agent O'Brian.

18
00:01:10,649 --> 00:01:13,086
We know you're down here.

19
00:01:18,137 --> 00:01:20,096
Hold fire!

20
00:01:20,179 --> 00:01:22,093
Do not fire!

21
00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:23,741
What the hell's going on?

22
00:01:23,824 --> 00:01:27,503
Jack's being framed to cover up
the real reason Palmer was assassinated.

23
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:29,147
- Where is he?
- I can't tell you.

24
00:01:29,509 --> 00:01:33,587
- Where's the baggage claim supervisor?
- Down that hall, to the left.

25
00:01:35,116 --> 00:01:36,345
Chevensky.

26
00:01:36,917 --> 00:01:41,314
- Why was President Palmer killed?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

27
00:01:41,403 --> 00:01:44,523
You will tell me.
It's just a question of how much it hurts.

28
00:01:46,048 --> 00:01:48,610
Mom, do you see those men?

29
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:52,130
- I have to warn Jack.
- Derek, where are you going? Come back!

30
00:02:03,587 --> 00:02:05,386
No!

31
00:02:05,469 --> 00:02:06,950
Quiet!

32
00:02:07,151 --> 00:02:08,745
Quiet!

33
00:02:10,675 --> 00:02:15,436
You will not be harmed as long as
your president complies with our wishes.

34
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:31,457
Back up now. Back up right now.

35
00:02:33,981 --> 00:02:36,133
We have a critical incident in progress.

36
00:02:36,224 --> 00:02:40,106
I want a facility lockdown
and a code five evac right now.

37
00:02:40,188 --> 00:02:42,226
- Clear the area!
- My son is in there.

38
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:45,430
Sorry, we're evacuating the area.
Follow these people.

39
00:02:46,114 --> 00:02:47,707
Grab her!

40
00:02:47,796 --> 00:02:50,267
I have to get my son!

41
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:52,235
Derek!

42
00:02:53,242 --> 00:02:54,312
Derek!

43
00:02:54,403 --> 00:02:58,879
I have information for CTU!
My son's in there!

44
00:02:59,448 --> 00:03:01,601
Everyone quiet.

45
00:03:03,173 --> 00:03:07,090
Keep your heads down. Do not move.

46
00:03:28,481 --> 00:03:33,561
If you cooperate, you have a chance
of leaving this building alive.

47
00:03:33,646 --> 00:03:37,439
If you do not, you will die.
Do you understand?

48
00:03:39,654 --> 00:03:44,528
Take out all cellphones and pagers
and drop them on the floor.

49
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:53,748
We're gonna be OK. We're gonna be OK.

50
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:57,627
Bring them in.

51
00:03:58,954 --> 00:04:00,628
Move!

52
00:04:06,122 --> 00:04:07,922
Chevensky?

53
00:04:09,727 --> 00:04:11,400
Chevensky?

54
00:04:19,937 --> 00:04:21,658
<i>- Da.
- Well?</i>

55
00:04:21,739 --> 00:04:24,974
- Chevensky's not here.
- We have to find him. Keep searching.

56
00:04:52,974 --> 00:04:55,252
<i>- McLaren.
- Listen very carefully.</i>

57
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:56,657
We have hostages.

58
00:04:56,738 --> 00:05:01,100
If you wish to keep them alive, you will
make no attempt to re-enter the terminal.

59
00:05:01,183 --> 00:05:04,064
We are wearing explosive vests.

60
00:05:04,146 --> 00:05:07,266
We're prepared to detonate ourselves
and our captives.

61
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:12,874
If you try to enter the terminal, you will spend
the rest of the day collecting body parts.

62
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,473
Hello?

63
00:05:19,243 --> 00:05:21,236
Set up a security perimeter.

64
00:05:21,325 --> 00:05:24,400
We'll operate from the northwest apron
behind hangar 12.

65
00:05:24,489 --> 00:05:27,723
Get those fire trucks outta here!
Everybody out.

66
00:05:27,812 --> 00:05:32,254
Grab that woman in the yellow next to Bailey.
Bring her up here. Quick.

67
00:05:55,283 --> 00:05:58,358
All right. Yeah, thank you.

68
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:01,800
I spoke to the director of Secret Service.

69
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:05,648
Now Suvarov has arrived safely,
they're lowering their security level.

70
00:06:05,734 --> 00:06:08,934
We should do the same.
I'll take our tac teams off stand-by.

71
00:06:09,018 --> 00:06:11,329
Have we heard from the unit at the refinery?

72
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:14,496
Yeah. At least that part
of Chloe's story checked out.

73
00:06:14,584 --> 00:06:17,181
So it's possible Jack was set up.

74
00:06:17,267 --> 00:06:19,943
Jack still has a lot to answer for.

75
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:25,555
<i>- Buchanan.
- I have Jack Bauer on the line.</i>

76
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,718
<i>- Put it through.
- Yes, sir.</i>

77
00:06:30,802 --> 00:06:33,717
Bill, put it on speakerphone.

78
00:06:34,406 --> 00:06:36,160
Please.

79
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:39,160
Jack, it's Bill.

80
00:06:39,251 --> 00:06:44,889
<i>I'm inside Ontario Airport. Gunmen have
taken over terminal one. They have hostages.</i>

81
00:06:44,977 --> 00:06:48,451
- We haven't received any alerts.
- Trust me, you will.

82
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:51,298
- What are you doing at the airport?
- Following a lead.

83
00:06:51,384 --> 00:06:55,268
Palmer knew of the planned attack.
I believe that's why he was assassinated.

84
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:59,028
Interagency flash -
there's been an attack on Ontario Airport.

85
00:06:59,113 --> 00:07:02,632
Several men
have taken control of terminal one.

86
00:07:02,717 --> 00:07:05,439
Go to alert level four. Launch all tac teams.

87
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,037
- Curtis is in the air.
- Redirect him to the airport.

88
00:07:08,123 --> 00:07:12,245
Have him maintain operational control
the moment he's on site.

89
00:07:12,328 --> 00:07:16,245
Jack, we got confirmation of the situation.
I want you out of there now.

90
00:07:16,332 --> 00:07:18,849
<i>Turn yourself in. Let our people handle this.</i>

91
00:07:18,935 --> 00:07:23,570
Understand this, Bill - I don't work for you.
I'm staying inside.

92
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:27,704
<i>You want my intel, fine.
But I'm doing this my way.</i>

93
00:07:33,231 --> 00:07:37,309
- How many hostiles are there?
- Approximately ten to twelve.

94
00:07:37,395 --> 00:07:41,632
Gunmen have locked down the terminal.
I'll send you photos of the hostiles.

95
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:46,002
They should be clear enough
that you can identify them. Hold on.

96
00:07:49,088 --> 00:07:53,405
- OK, they're transmitting.
- We'll forward you a schematic of the airport.

97
00:07:53,493 --> 00:07:56,489
One more thing.
A woman is gonna contact you.

98
00:07:56,577 --> 00:07:59,413
<i>Diane Huxley.
I sent her and her son to CTU for protection.</i>

99
00:07:59,499 --> 00:08:01,971
<i>- Who are they?
- I don't have time to explain.</i>

100
00:08:02,063 --> 00:08:05,696
<i>But I'm responsible for them.
Just make sure they're safe, OK?</i>

101
00:08:05,786 --> 00:08:09,909
- We'll take care of them, Jack.
- Thank you. I'll be standing by.

102
00:08:11,393 --> 00:08:14,786
- We have to alert the president.
- Right.

103
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:40,935
I want to extend my condolences
on the loss your country has suffered today.

104
00:08:41,026 --> 00:08:44,818
Thank you, Mr. President. I hope
that what you and I accomplish here today

105
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:48,110
will serve as a fitting tribute
to David Palmer's legacy.

106
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,756
I can't imagine anything more appropriate

107
00:08:50,836 --> 00:08:56,713
than establishing a comprehensive
anti-terrorism alliance between our nations.

108
00:09:01,608 --> 00:09:03,920
- If you'd excuse me for a moment.
- Of course.

109
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:05,890
Thank you.

110
00:09:08,175 --> 00:09:09,325
What's up?

111
00:09:09,417 --> 00:09:14,257
Terrorists are controlling the main terminal
of Ontario Airport in Los Angeles.

112
00:09:14,342 --> 00:09:15,572
Terrorists?

113
00:09:15,664 --> 00:09:20,743
There are eye-witness reports
of two casualties and they've taken hostages.

114
00:09:22,711 --> 00:09:24,909
- Who are they?
- Unclear.

115
00:09:24,994 --> 00:09:28,274
CTU Los Angeles is prepping a briefing.

116
00:09:29,239 --> 00:09:32,039
Mr. President, I suggest
we move to the situation room.

117
00:09:32,122 --> 00:09:33,112
Now?

118
00:09:33,203 --> 00:09:37,405
CTU thinks this may be related to the summit.

119
00:09:37,488 --> 00:09:39,286
Related in what way?

120
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:43,686
I don't know, sir,
but we'll find out during the briefing.

121
00:09:43,775 --> 00:09:46,372
Mr. President?

122
00:09:47,099 --> 00:09:50,538
- Sir, we should go.
- Of course.

123
00:09:56,789 --> 00:09:59,590
Mr. President, as you've probably
been made aware,

124
00:09:59,672 --> 00:10:03,305
a situation has developed
that requires my immediate attention.

125
00:10:03,396 --> 00:10:06,631
I have just been informed.
This is terrible news indeed.

126
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,237
Please let me know
if there is anything I can do.

127
00:10:09,323 --> 00:10:11,395
I will. Thank you, sir.

128
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:13,922
That's all for now.

129
00:10:14,368 --> 00:10:15,404
Spenser?

130
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:19,123
Pulling the ground plan of the terminal
and sending it to Bauer now.

131
00:10:19,214 --> 00:10:23,052
Good. Edgar, were you able to identify
the terrorists from Jack's photos?

132
00:10:23,138 --> 00:10:25,894
Still no matches. I tried three encoding arrays.

133
00:10:25,981 --> 00:10:29,057
- Widen the parameters?
- Any wider, we could use the phonebook.

134
00:10:29,144 --> 00:10:32,697
Hold on a second.
Try using an np-Safe adaptive search.

135
00:10:32,789 --> 00:10:36,023
- Are you OK?
- Thanks for asking, Edgar.

136
00:10:37,834 --> 00:10:42,355
Chloe, you managed to rack up
four protocol violations.

137
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:47,200
It's a lot worse than that if you count agency
dot codes. It's more like 26 violations.

138
00:10:47,284 --> 00:10:52,444
Do you want me to figure out whose face
that is? Or I could just go wait in Holding.

139
00:10:53,932 --> 00:10:56,130
See what you can do.

140
00:10:56,214 --> 00:10:58,173
- Did it work?
- We got something.

141
00:10:58,256 --> 00:11:01,411
It's off an archive
from the Bureau of Continental Affairs.

142
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,894
Anton Beresch, ex-army officer
in a Russian breakaway republic.

143
00:11:04,984 --> 00:11:07,375
So this is definitely to do with the summit.

144
00:11:07,466 --> 00:11:10,621
I'll data-mine the interagency server,
see what I come up with.

145
00:11:10,951 --> 00:11:15,347
DOD is receiving a localised broadcast from
the airport. The networks are picking it up.

146
00:11:15,435 --> 00:11:18,032
Spenser, put it on the screen.

147
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,799
Citizens of the United States,

148
00:11:21,882 --> 00:11:25,003
your president and the president of Russia
have come together

149
00:11:25,086 --> 00:11:28,799
to sign what they have called
"an historical accord",

150
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:32,170
an anti-terrorism alliance.

151
00:11:32,254 --> 00:11:38,530
Your leaders claim it will bring peace
and security to their respective countries,

152
00:11:38,621 --> 00:11:42,665
but you will soon learn
it will accomplish exactly the opposite.

153
00:11:42,745 --> 00:11:46,265
We are acting on behalf
of the oppressed people of our region.

154
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:51,349
A people whose desire to be free
is every bit as strong as your own.

155
00:11:51,435 --> 00:11:56,434
We are prepared to use every means
at our disposal to achieve our goal.

156
00:11:56,521 --> 00:11:58,514
I have hostages.

157
00:11:58,603 --> 00:12:01,404
Unless President Logan
and President Suvarov

158
00:12:01,486 --> 00:12:07,841
make a joint statement repudiating
this accord, I will order their execution.

159
00:12:07,934 --> 00:12:10,211
<i>You have exactly 90 minutes.</i>

160
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:12,688
We have to get this lunatic off the air.

161
00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:17,858
Sir, we can contact the networks, but
they're under no legal obligation to comply.

162
00:12:17,944 --> 00:12:22,466
We take these actions
knowing that we will be called butchers.

163
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:25,113
But we are only responding to the violence

164
00:12:25,192 --> 00:12:28,746
that has been inflicted
upon our own sons and daughters.

165
00:12:28,837 --> 00:12:35,316
Until we as a people
achieve our own due national sovereignty,

166
00:12:35,404 --> 00:12:38,285
terror will be met with terror.

167
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:44,853
<i>That was a live feed from Ontario Airport
in Southern California.</i>

168
00:12:44,935 --> 00:12:47,371
<i>As we just heard, terrorists are demanding</i>

169
00:12:47,457 --> 00:12:50,658
<i>that President Logan
repudiate the anti-terrorism accord.</i>

170
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:56,185
This is insane. How do these people
get control of an entire airport?

171
00:12:56,267 --> 00:12:59,182
We've been preparing
for this summit for 16 months.

172
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:01,741
Every news agency in the world is here.

173
00:13:01,832 --> 00:13:04,828
I've staked my entire administration
on this day,

174
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:08,674
and now these people are demanding
that I go on national television

175
00:13:08,761 --> 00:13:10,832
and repudiate everything we've done?

176
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:15,284
- Perhaps you should take a few moments...
- Mike!

177
00:13:15,368 --> 00:13:18,603
I want this handled. Do you understand?

178
00:13:18,692 --> 00:13:22,450
I don't care how you do it.
I don't care what it takes. Fix it.

179
00:13:43,479 --> 00:13:45,472
All right.

180
00:13:52,969 --> 00:13:54,848
- Go ahead.
- It's Jack.

181
00:13:54,932 --> 00:13:57,084
I'm staring down on the main concourse.

182
00:13:57,174 --> 00:14:01,331
I've got six hostiles in explosive vests.
Four are staying near the hostages.

183
00:14:01,419 --> 00:14:05,701
I expect their orders are to detonate if
we make a move. The other two are roaming.

184
00:14:05,784 --> 00:14:10,943
Two security doors on the northeast side,
both chained but currently unguarded.

185
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:13,592
Get a recon unit over to the northeast wall.

186
00:14:13,672 --> 00:14:15,949
Jack, I need you to quarterback this.

187
00:14:16,035 --> 00:14:19,634
Excuse me. I got a woman, Diane Huxley,
says she has info for CTU.

188
00:14:19,719 --> 00:14:21,473
Diane Huxley?

189
00:14:21,561 --> 00:14:23,953
<i>- Curtis, did you say Diane Huxley?
- Yes, I did.</i>

190
00:14:24,044 --> 00:14:25,763
- Is she there?
- Yeah.

191
00:14:25,846 --> 00:14:28,203
- Let me speak to her.
- Bring her over.

192
00:14:28,288 --> 00:14:31,284
Ms Huxley, over here, please.

193
00:14:32,453 --> 00:14:35,095
- Hello?
- Diane, what's going on? What's wrong?

194
00:14:35,176 --> 00:14:38,934
- Derek is inside the terminal.
- What do you mean? I left him with you.

195
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:41,491
He saw some men. He wanted to warn you.

196
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:44,658
Then... I tried to go after him.
There was an explosion.

197
00:14:44,746 --> 00:14:48,459
- Are you sure he made it all the way inside?
- I don't know!

198
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:50,304
Hold on.

199
00:15:05,449 --> 00:15:10,813
Keep your eyes on the floor.
Eyes down.

200
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:16,453
Dammit!

201
00:15:17,983 --> 00:15:21,342
I see him. He's with the other hostages,
but he's not hurt.

202
00:15:21,427 --> 00:15:25,629
Please don't let anything happen to him.
Jack, I can't lose my son.

203
00:15:25,712 --> 00:15:27,944
Diane, listen to me.

204
00:15:28,034 --> 00:15:32,795
I promise you on my life, I am gonna get
Derek back to you. Do you understand me?

205
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:36,239
- OK. OK.
- Let me speak to Curtis.

206
00:15:40,047 --> 00:15:41,038
Jack.

207
00:15:41,128 --> 00:15:45,571
I need to ask you a favour.
Let Ms Huxley stay at the command post.

208
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:49,253
You got it. Let me know
if the hostiles adjust their profile.

209
00:15:49,338 --> 00:15:52,618
Copy that. I'll get back to you.

210
00:15:55,385 --> 00:15:57,581
Son of a bitch.

211
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:21,328
His name is Anton Beresch.
He's a member of the Dawn Brigade -

212
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:24,853
separatists blamed
for numerous terrorist bombings in Russia.

213
00:16:24,937 --> 00:16:28,980
Precisely the kind of organisation
today's accord was designed to combat.

214
00:16:29,061 --> 00:16:32,900
Bill, I have no intention
of calling off this signing.

215
00:16:32,986 --> 00:16:35,502
So you have 90 minutes
to rescue the hostages.

216
00:16:35,589 --> 00:16:39,745
We're operating under that timetable.
We're making an on-site assessment.

217
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:42,430
Spare the agency patter. Just get it done.

218
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:46,351
Sir, you need to be aware.

219
00:16:46,441 --> 00:16:49,675
<i>We should be prepared
for additional civilian casualties.</i>

220
00:16:49,765 --> 00:16:52,122
- More casualties?
- It's a possibility.

221
00:16:52,207 --> 00:16:55,203
I'm not prepared to accept any such thing.

222
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:57,807
Bill, it's your job to get them out alive.

223
00:16:57,893 --> 00:17:00,410
The terrorists are wearing explosive vests.

224
00:17:00,496 --> 00:17:05,291
They've threatened to detonate themselves
if any attempt is made to retake the terminal.

225
00:17:05,382 --> 00:17:09,220
- I'm aware of the situation.
- Have you tried initiating a dialogue?

226
00:17:09,306 --> 00:17:12,381
Yes, what about talking to them?
Have you tried that?

227
00:17:12,469 --> 00:17:16,752
Beresch called an airport sergeant -
a blocked number, but we're back-tracing it.

228
00:17:16,834 --> 00:17:19,146
Whatever you do, just do it by the deadline.

229
00:17:19,237 --> 00:17:23,872
When I sign that accord, I do not want it to be
the death warrant of innocent Americans.

230
00:17:23,961 --> 00:17:26,080
Yes, Mr. President.

231
00:17:26,164 --> 00:17:28,965
- Got the number?
- We just completed the back-trace.

232
00:17:29,047 --> 00:17:30,846
Try it.

233
00:17:37,617 --> 00:17:39,815
We're all gonna die.

234
00:17:39,899 --> 00:17:43,293
It's gonna be OK. It's gonna be OK.

235
00:17:47,028 --> 00:17:48,303
Yes?

236
00:17:48,389 --> 00:17:52,592
This is Bill Buchanan, director
of the Los Angeles Counter Terrorist Unit.

237
00:17:52,673 --> 00:17:53,744
I'm listening.

238
00:17:53,835 --> 00:17:58,152
The president authorised me to speak for him.
I hope we can resolve this peacefully.

239
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,796
I told you how to resolve this peacefully.
Your president must make a public statement.

240
00:18:02,885 --> 00:18:06,883
- He's considering that option.
- We have nothing more to speak about.

241
00:18:06,969 --> 00:18:10,409
There must be some other way
we can address your demands.

242
00:18:10,494 --> 00:18:13,169
I don't think you understand
how serious we are.

243
00:18:13,257 --> 00:18:15,773
I know the president...

244
00:18:18,142 --> 00:18:20,818
- Data-mine that call.
- Yes, sir.

245
00:18:21,425 --> 00:18:23,737
Get up! Up!

246
00:18:24,749 --> 00:18:26,469
Bring him.

247
00:18:26,551 --> 00:18:28,988
Curtis, they're moving one of the hostages.

248
00:18:41,447 --> 00:18:43,406
On your knees.

249
00:18:47,734 --> 00:18:49,169
Oh, my God.

250
00:18:53,621 --> 00:18:56,856
Please. I have a wife.

251
00:18:58,546 --> 00:18:59,946
So do I.

252
00:19:00,749 --> 00:19:02,867
No...

253
00:19:47,079 --> 00:19:48,912
You.

254
00:19:49,322 --> 00:19:50,723
No!

255
00:19:51,164 --> 00:19:55,082
They're moving another hostage.
I can't see where. I'm changing position.

256
00:20:13,068 --> 00:20:16,907
I'm watching. Yeah. OK.

257
00:20:17,433 --> 00:20:19,392
- Derek?
- Ma'am... Please, ma'am.

258
00:20:19,475 --> 00:20:22,789
That's my son. They're gonna kill my son!

259
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,239
- That's my son!
- She can't watch this. Get her out of here.

260
00:20:26,323 --> 00:20:28,520
No! Let me go!

261
00:20:28,606 --> 00:20:31,521
Let me go! No!

262
00:20:38,176 --> 00:20:43,654
In 15 minutes, your president will get
another demonstration of our commitment.

263
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:45,336
15 minutes.

264
00:20:45,424 --> 00:20:49,023
- I'm in position. How long till you're ready?
- A half-hour.

265
00:20:49,108 --> 00:20:52,741
- We're still transferring personnel.
- Too long. Advance your attack.

266
00:20:52,832 --> 00:20:55,748
- We're just not ready.
- They're gonna kill that kid.

267
00:20:55,836 --> 00:21:00,631
Jack... I heard that woman Diane's
side of the conversation.

268
00:21:00,721 --> 00:21:05,641
This has nothing to do with her. They'll
continue to kill hostages until the deadline.

269
00:21:05,726 --> 00:21:09,166
We can't risk the lives
of all those hostages for one kid.

270
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:11,767
Just tell your men to hurry.

271
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:14,131
<i>They will.</i>

272
00:21:37,627 --> 00:21:42,946
<i>Until we as a people
achieve our own due national sovereignty,</i>

273
00:21:43,033 --> 00:21:45,550
<i>terror will be met with terror.</i>

274
00:21:45,636 --> 00:21:47,947
It's all connected.

275
00:21:48,038 --> 00:21:52,435
<i>...threatening to execute
a second hostage in less than 15 minutes.</i>

276
00:21:52,523 --> 00:21:54,994
<i>There's been no reaction from the president...</i>

277
00:21:55,087 --> 00:21:58,321
Maybe that's enough.
The doctor said you shouldn't...

278
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:02,123
Evelyn, David Palmer called me last night.

279
00:22:02,935 --> 00:22:08,732
He said he had something to tell me.
It was a matter of national security.

280
00:22:08,822 --> 00:22:11,817
I think it has something to do with this.

281
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:14,984
- The terrorists?
- Yes.

282
00:22:15,068 --> 00:22:18,223
I tried to tell my husband
and Walt Cummings.

283
00:22:18,312 --> 00:22:20,544
They think I imagined the call.

284
00:22:20,635 --> 00:22:25,076
So he checked the phone recordings.
The conversations don't match.

285
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,757
Someone altered the conversation, Evelyn.

286
00:22:28,844 --> 00:22:31,758
Who would do something like that?

287
00:22:31,847 --> 00:22:33,840
I don't know.

288
00:22:37,533 --> 00:22:39,207
Listen to me.

289
00:22:39,295 --> 00:22:43,851
You have got to cover for me. No one
can know I am gone. Do you understand me?

290
00:22:45,862 --> 00:22:48,333
Where are you going?

291
00:23:14,454 --> 00:23:17,051
<i>- O'Brian.
- Chloe, is that you?</i>

292
00:23:17,137 --> 00:23:21,134
- Why are you answering the phone?
- Mr. Buchanan needed my help.

293
00:23:21,222 --> 00:23:22,816
- Are you alone?
- Yeah.

294
00:23:22,903 --> 00:23:26,662
I'm gonna send a picture of one
of the hostiles to your screen. Hold on.

295
00:23:30,591 --> 00:23:35,592
- OK. I got it.
- Enlarge the upper right corner of his vest.

296
00:23:40,082 --> 00:23:42,884
Looks like a secondary detonator,
cellphone activated.

297
00:23:42,965 --> 00:23:46,279
So the leader can set off the charges
if anybody gets cold feet.

298
00:23:46,369 --> 00:23:50,765
- I need the detonation frequency.
- I'll have to ID the detonator. Could take time.

299
00:23:50,854 --> 00:23:54,168
<i>- Just get started.
- Did you clear this with Buchanan?</i>

300
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:58,412
No.

301
00:23:58,502 --> 00:24:01,259
Chloe, can you see the live feed?

302
00:24:04,669 --> 00:24:06,901
Oh, my God. It's Derek.

303
00:24:07,552 --> 00:24:09,785
I need your help.

304
00:24:09,875 --> 00:24:11,868
OK. I'll get back to you.

305
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:15,512
Spenser.

306
00:24:16,522 --> 00:24:18,755
I was really worried about you.

307
00:24:18,845 --> 00:24:24,483
Not now. I need you to reconfigure
Jack's phone to emit an alternate signal.

308
00:24:29,977 --> 00:24:33,337
- What for?
- Could you just work up a procedure?

309
00:24:33,421 --> 00:24:36,097
This is off-protocol, isn't it?

310
00:24:37,145 --> 00:24:38,659
Yes.

311
00:24:38,747 --> 00:24:42,984
Spenser, you know more about
bandwidth processing than anyone here.

312
00:24:45,395 --> 00:24:47,957
I need you.

313
00:25:02,853 --> 00:25:05,051
Got it?

314
00:25:06,378 --> 00:25:08,210
Yeah.

315
00:25:16,949 --> 00:25:21,903
It's Agent Pierce. I'm here
to escort Mrs. Logan to the Garden Room.

316
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,274
She's still not ready.

317
00:25:29,362 --> 00:25:35,478
President Logan is expecting her 15 minutes
before the ceremony. Could I speak with her?

318
00:25:43,498 --> 00:25:45,776
What's going on?

319
00:25:45,861 --> 00:25:47,980
She's in one of her moods.

320
00:25:48,063 --> 00:25:51,183
If you push her, you'll make her worse.

321
00:25:51,267 --> 00:25:54,068
- I'll wait out here.
- Thanks.

322
00:26:22,461 --> 00:26:25,137
- It's Mr. Burk, isn't it?
- Uh, Mrs. Logan...

323
00:26:25,225 --> 00:26:28,858
- You work in the communications office?
- Yes, ma'am.

324
00:26:28,948 --> 00:26:34,746
I know all phone conversations are recorded.
Where do they keep those recordings?

325
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:43,760
Well, the calls are recorded onto a hard drive.
It's part of the central server.

326
00:26:43,845 --> 00:26:46,315
Is there by any chance any hard copies?

327
00:26:46,407 --> 00:26:50,200
Actually, the president insists
on written transcripts as backups.

328
00:26:50,292 --> 00:26:53,048
- He's kind of old-fashioned that way.
- I know.

329
00:26:53,135 --> 00:26:56,927
- Where do they store those transcripts?
- Archive room down the hall.

330
00:26:57,019 --> 00:26:59,661
- Can you show me?
- Access is restricted. Uh...

331
00:26:59,742 --> 00:27:02,259
- I'm the first lady.
- I understand, Mrs. Logan.

332
00:27:02,345 --> 00:27:05,546
But there are security requirements.
You need an entry card.

333
00:27:05,628 --> 00:27:07,542
Do you have one?

334
00:27:07,631 --> 00:27:09,670
- Well, yes, I do...
- Can I borrow it?

335
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:12,475
It's extremely important.

336
00:27:13,317 --> 00:27:17,874
Mrs. Logan, I'm sorry.
Um, there's nothing I can do.

337
00:27:17,962 --> 00:27:22,404
Mr. Burk, we can continue this little dance
if you really want to,

338
00:27:22,487 --> 00:27:25,482
but you and I both know
I am going to get into that room.

339
00:27:25,571 --> 00:27:30,047
So you can save us both the trouble
and just give me your entry card.

340
00:27:30,136 --> 00:27:33,894
- Mrs. Logan, you wouldn't...
- You know, in three seconds, Mr. Burk,

341
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:38,740
I am going to scream louder than any woman
you have ever heard in your life.

342
00:27:38,826 --> 00:27:41,581
One, two...

343
00:27:41,669 --> 00:27:43,787
Here's the card right here.

344
00:27:43,871 --> 00:27:46,228
Thank you. Thank you.

345
00:27:47,354 --> 00:27:49,746
I'll return it very soon.

346
00:28:17,628 --> 00:28:21,307
- O'Brian.
- Derek has three minutes. I need a frequency.

347
00:28:21,393 --> 00:28:25,071
- We're trying to find the manufacturer.
- We're running out of time.

348
00:28:25,156 --> 00:28:28,311
If we get the frequency wrong,
we could detonate all the vests.

349
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,792
I can't find a match
on any Czech components.

350
00:28:30,882 --> 00:28:35,439
That leaves the German manufacturers.
Jack, we're trying to narrow it down.

351
00:28:40,734 --> 00:28:44,617
The first team enter through
the southeast door and split into two flanks.

352
00:28:44,698 --> 00:28:47,339
Primary kill shots,
take out hostiles in bomb vests.

353
00:28:47,421 --> 00:28:51,816
Second team enters and forms
a protective ring around the hostages.

354
00:28:51,906 --> 00:28:56,861
We'll only have a few seconds to neutralise
the hostiles, so find your targets fast.

355
00:28:56,952 --> 00:28:58,386
Go.

356
00:28:59,074 --> 00:29:02,514
- What's your time frame?
- On target to launch assault in 15 minutes.

357
00:29:02,597 --> 00:29:04,033
Understood.

358
00:29:16,013 --> 00:29:18,051
How old are you?

359
00:29:19,857 --> 00:29:22,134
15.

360
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:25,135
Try to control your breathing.

361
00:29:26,343 --> 00:29:28,382
Slow down.

362
00:29:33,231 --> 00:29:36,466
See? Better.

363
00:29:38,437 --> 00:29:40,430
Please don't kill me.

364
00:29:42,882 --> 00:29:45,240
That's up to your president.

365
00:29:57,499 --> 00:30:02,577
<i>- Bill Buchanan.
- Beresch is calling from the airport, sir.</i>

366
00:30:04,105 --> 00:30:05,620
This is Bill Buchanan.

367
00:30:05,707 --> 00:30:08,748
The boy hasn't long to live.

368
00:30:08,831 --> 00:30:11,393
No word from the president yet.
We need more time.

369
00:30:11,474 --> 00:30:16,268
No. The president must announce
the summit is cancelled, or I kill the boy.

370
00:30:16,359 --> 00:30:19,195
We're doing our best
to get an answer from the president.

371
00:30:19,282 --> 00:30:22,995
I implore you to resolve this
without further killing.

372
00:30:23,086 --> 00:30:25,604
This boy's blood will be on his hands.

373
00:30:28,572 --> 00:30:29,802
Come on, Chloe.

374
00:30:29,894 --> 00:30:33,527
We found the manufacturer.
We're trying to figure out the frequency.

375
00:30:33,618 --> 00:30:36,694
- No match on the 2004 series.
- It's gotta be one of these three.

376
00:30:39,825 --> 00:30:42,022
Hold him.

377
00:30:42,548 --> 00:30:44,541
Agent Manning.

378
00:30:48,034 --> 00:30:49,230
I got it.

379
00:30:49,315 --> 00:30:52,516
Here it is.
Go to submenu three on your phone.

380
00:30:52,599 --> 00:30:56,039
- I'm at submenu.
- Enter this code - 6339.

381
00:30:56,804 --> 00:31:00,323
- Now what?
- The phone needs to reboot. It'll say "Ready. "

382
00:31:00,407 --> 00:31:03,687
Then press the star key
and it should set off the detonator.

383
00:31:06,214 --> 00:31:08,651
Your president has abandoned you.

384
00:31:08,737 --> 00:31:12,529
- I'm not getting a ready signal.
- It takes time to reflash the ROM.

385
00:31:14,503 --> 00:31:17,418
Son of a bitch. Come on.

386
00:31:17,506 --> 00:31:19,500
I'm sorry.

387
00:31:22,432 --> 00:31:24,994
I got it. I got it.

388
00:31:32,523 --> 00:31:35,962
- Curtis, what was that?
- There was an explosion in the terminal.

389
00:31:36,047 --> 00:31:37,481
Patch me through to Jack.

390
00:31:39,371 --> 00:31:42,171
Stay in position!
Keep the hostages together!

391
00:31:42,254 --> 00:31:45,613
Check the exits.
Make sure the perimeter's secure.

392
00:31:54,868 --> 00:31:57,259
It was Ibrim's vest.

393
00:31:57,351 --> 00:31:59,787
It must have detonated by accident.

394
00:31:59,873 --> 00:32:02,470
- What's going on?
- A terrorist's vest blew up.

395
00:32:02,556 --> 00:32:06,873
- None of the hostages were hurt.
- Were you responsible for that, Jack?

396
00:32:07,441 --> 00:32:09,274
Jack, answer me!

397
00:32:09,885 --> 00:32:13,039
They were gonna kill another hostage.
I had no choice.

398
00:32:13,128 --> 00:32:15,007
I didn't compromise my position.

399
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:18,165
Now tell me this -
are Curtis and his team on schedule?

400
00:32:18,254 --> 00:32:21,488
- Yes. Go time is ten minutes.
- OK.

401
00:32:21,577 --> 00:32:26,816
Everyone, pull into formation B
and run circuit checks on your vests.

402
00:32:27,424 --> 00:32:31,979
The terrorists are revising their formation.
I'll contact Curtis with final positions.

403
00:32:32,069 --> 00:32:32,980
Thanks, Jack.

404
00:32:35,192 --> 00:32:39,793
<i>Mr. Buchanan,
President Logan's on the line for you.</i>

405
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,589
Mr. President.

406
00:32:42,681 --> 00:32:46,199
The news is saying there was
an explosion inside the terminal.

407
00:32:46,284 --> 00:32:50,760
Everything's under control, sir. Our units
are in position. Go time is ten minutes.

408
00:32:50,849 --> 00:32:53,571
- Then what caused the explosion?
- We're not certain.

409
00:32:53,653 --> 00:32:57,286
We believe our man inside
may have been trying to stall the execution

410
00:32:57,377 --> 00:32:59,654
and he triggered the bomb vest of a hostile.

411
00:32:59,739 --> 00:33:02,336
Did you authorise this action?

412
00:33:03,343 --> 00:33:07,306
No, sir. He acted independently.

413
00:33:07,388 --> 00:33:11,590
You should know, Mr. President,
the man we're talking about is Jack Bauer.

414
00:33:11,673 --> 00:33:12,663
Jack Bauer?

415
00:33:12,754 --> 00:33:17,958
He was in the terminal when the terrorists
attacked. He's been helping us from inside.

416
00:33:18,039 --> 00:33:21,639
I thought that... Jack Bauer
assassinated David Palmer.

417
00:33:21,723 --> 00:33:25,242
There's evidence to suggest
that Bauer may have been framed.

418
00:33:25,327 --> 00:33:28,323
- What evidence?
- It's complicated, Mr. President.

419
00:33:28,411 --> 00:33:30,085
Why am I only hearing this now?

420
00:33:30,173 --> 00:33:35,537
I didn't want to distract you with details that
can wait till we resolve the hostage situation.

421
00:33:35,619 --> 00:33:39,218
You tell me everything
and I will decide which details are relevant.

422
00:33:39,302 --> 00:33:42,696
- With respect, we don't have time.
- Then talk faster!

423
00:34:09,137 --> 00:34:13,293
Mrs. Logan is due in the Garden Room
right now. Open the door, please.

424
00:34:14,542 --> 00:34:16,341
Just a few more minutes.

425
00:34:16,424 --> 00:34:18,782
Ma'am, it's my job to make sure she's there.

426
00:34:18,867 --> 00:34:23,023
If you don't open the door,
I will open it myself.

427
00:34:25,034 --> 00:34:28,507
- Mrs. Logan?
- How dare you barge in here.

428
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:33,633
- Mrs. Logan?
- This is a private residence.

429
00:34:33,723 --> 00:34:38,803
Evelyn, if something happens to Mrs. Logan,
the blame will fall on you. We both know that.

430
00:34:38,889 --> 00:34:45,165
So I am urging you in the strongest
possible terms to tell me where she is.

431
00:35:02,795 --> 00:35:06,873
We're moving to entry positions.
Davies, Matthews, are your teams in place?

432
00:35:06,959 --> 00:35:09,636
<i>All teams in place.
Ready to go, Agent Manning.</i>

433
00:35:09,723 --> 00:35:12,114
All right, copy. Go.

434
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:18,401
- Oh, my God.
- It's OK. Listen. Derek's alive.

435
00:35:18,492 --> 00:35:20,406
- He's OK.
- Are you sure?

436
00:35:20,495 --> 00:35:23,217
I can't go into details, but he's OK.

437
00:35:23,297 --> 00:35:27,216
I have to go.
We're mounting our rescue operation.

438
00:35:27,783 --> 00:35:30,425
Keep an eye on her. Let's go.

439
00:35:44,401 --> 00:35:48,159
They're waiting for you
in the Garden Room, Mrs. Logan.

440
00:35:49,006 --> 00:35:52,001
- I can get up myself.
- All right.

441
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:55,005
You still need to come with me.

442
00:35:55,093 --> 00:35:58,772
Whatever you say, Aaron.
Whatever you say.

443
00:36:18,238 --> 00:36:20,802
- I'm so sorry, Mrs. Logan.
- It's all right.

444
00:36:20,881 --> 00:36:24,514
- I'm really sorry.
- Will you stop apologising? It's annoying.

445
00:36:24,605 --> 00:36:27,327
Besides, I got what I came for.

446
00:36:42,225 --> 00:36:44,947
<i>- Yes?
- You have a problem at the terminal.</i>

447
00:36:45,028 --> 00:36:47,101
<i>- Explain.
- Jack Bauer is inside,</i>

448
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:51,234
providing recon for CTU's rescue operation,
which will launch shortly.

449
00:36:51,314 --> 00:36:53,991
- Are you sure?
- This came from the director of CTU.

450
00:36:54,078 --> 00:36:58,361
<i>And Bauer was responsible for detonating
the vest of one of Beresch's men.</i>

451
00:36:58,443 --> 00:37:01,199
<i>- Can you tell me Bauer's precise location?
- No.</i>

452
00:37:01,286 --> 00:37:03,802
But he has a connection
to one of the hostages.

453
00:37:03,889 --> 00:37:07,283
<i>A 15-year-old boy named Derek Huxley.</i>

454
00:37:09,816 --> 00:37:11,809
I have to go.

455
00:37:12,618 --> 00:37:18,063
Yes, tell him that's being handled
out of the press office. Thank you.

456
00:37:18,144 --> 00:37:21,777
- Yes?
- Mrs. Logan is back in her room getting ready.

457
00:37:21,869 --> 00:37:25,946
- Why the delay?
- She was in one of the archive rooms.

458
00:37:26,034 --> 00:37:29,586
Archive rooms? What was she doing there?

459
00:37:30,959 --> 00:37:35,958
The first lady is safe and accounted for.
You'll need to ask her anything beyond that.

460
00:37:36,044 --> 00:37:38,002
Thank you, Aaron.

461
00:37:45,895 --> 00:37:47,888
C Team.

462
00:37:52,823 --> 00:37:56,581
Go to the ticket counters. The west exit.

463
00:38:05,277 --> 00:38:06,996
- Manning.
- This is Jack.

464
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:10,358
Beresch has redeployed six men.
Ready for final positions?

465
00:38:10,442 --> 00:38:11,843
Go ahead.

466
00:38:11,923 --> 00:38:15,078
Four men were deployed to the east side,
the ticket counters,

467
00:38:15,168 --> 00:38:18,608
the other two to the west side
in front of the emergency exits.

468
00:38:18,691 --> 00:38:19,681
Copy.

469
00:38:19,772 --> 00:38:23,565
OK, once you deploy I'll give you
real-time updates on their positions.

470
00:38:23,657 --> 00:38:28,531
All right, Jack, I'm starting the countdown.
All teams, stand by to execute.

471
00:38:29,984 --> 00:38:31,941
This is it.

472
00:38:39,875 --> 00:38:41,150
OK.

473
00:38:42,478 --> 00:38:44,675
Hostages up!

474
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,833
Hold on one second.

475
00:38:52,409 --> 00:38:54,128
Hold on.

476
00:38:54,531 --> 00:38:57,810
Hold on. Beresch is changing something.

477
00:38:59,136 --> 00:39:02,529
Jack? Jack?

478
00:39:02,619 --> 00:39:04,897
- Curtis, what happened?
- I lost Jack.

479
00:39:04,982 --> 00:39:07,897
- What do you mean?
- The connection's broken.

480
00:39:07,985 --> 00:39:10,058
- Can you reconnect?
- I'm trying.

481
00:39:15,794 --> 00:39:17,913
Jack Bauer.

482
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,791
Derek is a very brave young man.

483
00:39:24,644 --> 00:39:29,643
I will shoot him in the head
if you don't show yourself immediately.

484
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:31,768
<i>- Curtis!
- It's not going through.</i>

485
00:39:31,852 --> 00:39:35,610
- Can you move in without him?
- Jack said Beresch was moving something.

486
00:39:35,696 --> 00:39:38,930
He could be moving the hostages
into the kill zone.

487
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:39,976
Abort.

488
00:39:40,061 --> 00:39:43,022
All teams, abort the operation.
Repeat - abort.

489
00:39:44,987 --> 00:39:50,624
Bauer, if you want to save the boy,
present yourself now.

490
00:40:11,696 --> 00:40:14,338
Mr. Bauer.

491
00:40:14,418 --> 00:40:17,175
Derek has five seconds left to live.

492
00:40:17,943 --> 00:40:20,335
Four, three...

493
00:40:20,426 --> 00:40:22,338
Beresch!

494
00:40:27,714 --> 00:40:30,150
I'm lowering my weapon.

495
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,793
Secure him.
