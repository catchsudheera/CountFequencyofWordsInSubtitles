1
00:00:14,582 --> 00:00:18,291
You're a traitor to this country,
and a disgrace to your office.

2
00:00:18,382 --> 00:00:21,740
Logan wants me dead
because I know too much.

3
00:00:21,823 --> 00:00:23,939
Logan isn't worth protecting.

4
00:00:24,744 --> 00:00:27,737
- Aaron?
- Ma'am, please stay where you are.

5
00:00:39,506 --> 00:00:41,418
- Bierko's escaped.
- What?

6
00:00:41,507 --> 00:00:42,701
How long ago?

7
00:00:42,787 --> 00:00:47,144
- Davis, Karen Hayes. What happened?
- Our lead car got taken out by an IED.

8
00:00:47,228 --> 00:00:50,140
I overheard Bierko talking to his men.
He said they're not finished.

9
00:00:50,228 --> 00:00:53,062
I'm certain he said something
about a nerve gas canister.

10
00:00:53,149 --> 00:00:55,424
Henderson set up Bierko with the nerve gas.

11
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:58,899
- Trust me, he's not gonna help us.
- He will if we offer him a deal.

12
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:03,630
- What do you want?
- To disappear.

13
00:01:03,711 --> 00:01:06,783
Just like you did, so they wouldn't
turn you over to the Chinese.

14
00:01:06,871 --> 00:01:11,787
Anything less than Bierko's head on a plate -
this deal is off.

15
00:01:11,872 --> 00:01:14,671
<i>Bierko's gonna release the gas soon.
We need to know where.</i>

16
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:15,947
It's a Russian submarine.

17
00:01:16,033 --> 00:01:18,991
What is the armament package
on a Russian Delta IV class sub?

18
00:01:19,074 --> 00:01:21,508
12 Scorpion land-attack missiles.

19
00:01:21,593 --> 00:01:25,508
They carry multiple warheads.
One could take out several city blocks.

20
00:01:25,874 --> 00:01:28,708
<i>We believe the Natalia
has been targeted for a terrorist attack.</i>

21
00:01:28,795 --> 00:01:31,230
<i>The terrorists are after your missiles.</i>

22
00:01:31,316 --> 00:01:35,753
<i>Secure your vessel. Lock down
your weapon systems immediately.</i>

23
00:01:47,838 --> 00:01:50,034
That way.

24
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,312
We have control of the weapons system.

25
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:28,798
I've flushed the Sentox.
The atmospheric readings are all normal.

26
00:02:28,886 --> 00:02:30,684
It's safe to breathe.

27
00:02:34,247 --> 00:02:38,286
The coordinates for the targets,
upload them into the missiles.

28
00:02:38,368 --> 00:02:40,757
Begin the launch countdown.

29
00:02:46,409 --> 00:02:48,286
Remove your masks.

30
00:02:49,249 --> 00:02:51,889
<i>We are close to finishing
what we started today.</i>

31
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:55,281
I have identified 12 high-value targets.

32
00:02:55,371 --> 00:02:58,409
Financial centres, transportation hubs,

33
00:02:58,491 --> 00:03:01,609
high-population density areas.

34
00:03:01,692 --> 00:03:06,164
The Americans will wake up this morning
to discover how steep a price they've paid

35
00:03:06,253 --> 00:03:08,813
for their alliance with Moscow.

36
00:03:08,893 --> 00:03:11,931
And what we're about to accomplish today

37
00:03:12,014 --> 00:03:15,723
will be remembered
by our countrymen forever.

38
00:03:29,377 --> 00:03:31,766
<i>- Ms Raines.
- Admiral Kirkland.</i>

39
00:03:31,857 --> 00:03:35,214
You're reporting some type of emergency
at the Port of Los Angeles?

40
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:37,289
In anticipation of today's treaty,

41
00:03:37,378 --> 00:03:40,974
<i>the Russian submarine Natalia is
docked here for inspection by the navy.</i>

42
00:03:41,059 --> 00:03:43,654
I know the exercise.
I authorised it myself.

43
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:46,572
Terrorists have seized control
of that submarine.

44
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:49,653
What? We haven't received
a distress signal from the crew.

45
00:03:49,741 --> 00:03:53,051
<i>Because they're dead, all of them,
including the Russian crew.</i>

46
00:03:53,141 --> 00:03:57,532
We believe the terrorists flooded the sub's
ventilation system with Sentox nerve gas.

47
00:03:57,622 --> 00:04:00,136
<i>- My God.
- I don't mean to pre-empt your protocols,</i>

48
00:04:00,222 --> 00:04:03,932
but how long will it take you
to scramble a flight of F-18s?

49
00:04:04,022 --> 00:04:05,855
You want me to sink the submarine?

50
00:04:05,943 --> 00:04:11,099
<i>They have 12 multiple-warhead missiles,
which they will use against civilian targets</i>

51
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:13,779
unless we stop them first.

52
00:04:13,865 --> 00:04:16,663
<i>- I'll need this confirmed.
- Our ground team can confirm.</i>

53
00:04:16,745 --> 00:04:21,866
Now I need to know precisely how long
it will take to scramble these fighters.

54
00:04:21,946 --> 00:04:26,020
I'm sending you the estimated approach
vectors and ETA for my F-18s.

55
00:04:26,106 --> 00:04:28,860
I can have my fighter jets there
within 22-25 minutes.

56
00:04:28,948 --> 00:04:31,462
We have a problem.
According to our simulation,

57
00:04:31,548 --> 00:04:35,143
Bierko will have his missiles
in the air in less than 20 minutes.

58
00:04:35,228 --> 00:04:40,826
<i>I'm scrambling the jets now. It seems as if
this will be up to your team on the ground.</i>

59
00:04:53,872 --> 00:04:59,470
We have visual contact with the sub. Hatches
are still closed. Ship's been locked down.

60
00:04:59,553 --> 00:05:01,862
One hostile topside, standing guard.

61
00:05:01,953 --> 00:05:05,663
Chloe's simulation has Bierko firing
the missiles in less than 20 minutes.

62
00:05:05,753 --> 00:05:08,951
Sooner than that if he's already
started programming targets.

63
00:05:09,035 --> 00:05:13,904
The navy can't intercept in time.
I just got off the phone with Admiral Kirkland.

64
00:05:13,995 --> 00:05:17,989
He's scrambling F-18s, but they won't
be in the air in time to destroy the sub.

65
00:05:18,076 --> 00:05:20,352
- How far out are reinforcements?
- Too far.

66
00:05:20,436 --> 00:05:23,110
<i>Additional teams won't arrive
until after the launch.</i>

67
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:27,032
- Then we have to take out Bierko ourselves.
- That's not a real option.

68
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:31,988
There are only four entry points,
presumably locked down and defended.

69
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:36,152
<i>Bill's right. You don't have the
manpower or resources to get on that sub.</i>

70
00:05:36,239 --> 00:05:40,313
We might. Somebody just launched
a signal tube off the starboard side.

71
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,628
What's a signal tube?

72
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,952
A radio beacon crewmen can send
to the surface in an emergency.

73
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:49,752
If there are friendlies inside, they can help us
board. Scan all emergency frequencies.

74
00:05:49,842 --> 00:05:51,719
- On it.
- Standing by.

75
00:05:51,802 --> 00:05:53,555
Jack, just so we're straight...

76
00:05:53,642 --> 00:05:59,435
We stop Bierko, my wife and I
disappear for good, with your help, right?

77
00:05:59,523 --> 00:06:01,037
- Yeah.
- One other thing.

78
00:06:01,124 --> 00:06:04,003
If I'm going on that sub, I need a firearm.

79
00:06:04,084 --> 00:06:07,441
- I'll cover you.
- That's what I'm worried about.

80
00:06:07,525 --> 00:06:09,675
I don't go in undefended against hostiles.

81
00:06:09,765 --> 00:06:14,157
- I still consider you a hostile.
- I don't get a gun, I don't go in.

82
00:06:14,246 --> 00:06:17,796
You were right.
A survivor is sending a distress signal.

83
00:06:17,887 --> 00:06:19,764
- Can we receive here?
- Yeah.

84
00:06:19,847 --> 00:06:21,964
Patch him through.

85
00:06:26,368 --> 00:06:31,807
<i>I repeat. This is Petty Officer Tim Rooney
on Natalia K-524,</i>

86
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:34,927
Code Seven. SOS. We are under attack.

87
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:39,289
Petty Officer Rooney, my name is Jack Bauer.
I'm with the Counter Terrorist Unit.

88
00:06:39,371 --> 00:06:43,444
What the hell's going on, sir?
Everyone's dead.

89
00:06:43,532 --> 00:06:46,968
People are in the control room
trying to operate the launch system.

90
00:06:47,052 --> 00:06:48,964
- Who are they?
- Russian separatists.

91
00:06:49,052 --> 00:06:51,930
They were responsible
for the attacks earlier today.

92
00:06:52,013 --> 00:06:56,132
- Does the navy know?
- They sent fighters, but they won't be in time.

93
00:06:58,694 --> 00:07:02,483
- So what do we do?
- Did anyone else from your crew survive?

94
00:07:05,135 --> 00:07:08,252
- No, I don't think so.
- Where are you?

95
00:07:08,336 --> 00:07:13,126
Uh, lower level, auxiliary engineering. I was
doing an inventory when the alarms went off.

96
00:07:13,216 --> 00:07:15,333
The atmospheric gauges redlined.

97
00:07:15,417 --> 00:07:17,453
It's a sealed compartment. I shut it down.

98
00:07:17,538 --> 00:07:20,530
The men that attacked the ship,
were they wearing gas masks?

99
00:07:20,618 --> 00:07:22,609
Yes, but they took 'em off
a few minutes ago.

100
00:07:22,698 --> 00:07:25,850
Good. That means they flushed
the Sentox out of the air system.

101
00:07:25,939 --> 00:07:28,931
You should be able to move around freely.
Hold on one second.

102
00:07:29,019 --> 00:07:34,731
Chloe, get me the nearest entry point
to Petty Officer Rooney's current position.

103
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:37,972
The closest hatch is the forward escape hatch.

104
00:07:38,061 --> 00:07:40,495
Petty Officer, do you have a firearm?

105
00:07:40,582 --> 00:07:43,460
No, the armoury's on
the other side of the ship.

106
00:07:43,542 --> 00:07:46,011
You need to find something
to use as a weapon.

107
00:07:46,103 --> 00:07:49,573
I have a utility tool.
It has a knife on it.

108
00:07:49,664 --> 00:07:53,213
That'll work. Go to the upper level.
Let me know when you get there.

109
00:07:53,304 --> 00:07:59,744
- What do you want me to do?
- Find the forward escape hatch and let us in.

110
00:08:00,345 --> 00:08:04,419
- There's a man there, guarding it.
- Then you're gonna have to kill him.

111
00:08:06,506 --> 00:08:08,622
<i>Officer Rooney?</i>

112
00:08:08,707 --> 00:08:12,587
I'm an engineer. I'm not trained for that.

113
00:08:12,667 --> 00:08:17,264
<i>The men on the Natalia plan to use its
missiles on civilians, unless we stop them.</i>

114
00:08:17,348 --> 00:08:23,026
<i>Make your way to the upper level.
Do it now. We are running out of time.</i>

115
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:26,510
- I'll contact you when I get there.
- Copy that.

116
00:08:32,711 --> 00:08:35,179
We need to get closer to the sub.
Are you ready?

117
00:08:35,271 --> 00:08:38,309
I know you've got Malina's. 45
in that bag. Give it to me.

118
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:44,422
Let's go.

119
00:08:48,033 --> 00:08:52,426
We're generating a list of potential targets,
but we have no idea what Bierko plans to hit.

120
00:08:52,515 --> 00:08:54,790
- Are we evacuating?
- We don't have time.

121
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:59,346
The missiles will strike before
we can mobilise anyone to the safe zones.

122
00:08:59,436 --> 00:09:03,316
How could this happen? How could
these people even access the submarine?

123
00:09:03,396 --> 00:09:06,912
The sub was attacked while
it was being serviced at a civilian port,

124
00:09:06,997 --> 00:09:12,230
not on a naval base, where security
would have been more substantial.

125
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:15,947
There has to be a way to destroy that sub
before Bierko can launch.

126
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:19,270
F-18s are scrambling as we speak.

127
00:09:21,599 --> 00:09:25,991
But according to the latest estimates,
they won't get there on time.

128
00:09:34,361 --> 00:09:35,761
<i>Yes?</i>

129
00:09:35,842 --> 00:09:37,674
I'm still waiting to talk to Mike.

130
00:09:37,763 --> 00:09:41,233
He's in a crisis meeting.
There's no telling how long he'll be.

131
00:09:41,323 --> 00:09:43,439
Then I should get off the ranch on my own.

132
00:09:43,524 --> 00:09:48,154
No. Without Mike's help, you'll be seen.
Charles can't find out you're still alive.

133
00:09:49,044 --> 00:09:51,400
- I'll call you when I get ahold of Mike.
- OK.

134
00:09:58,126 --> 00:10:01,881
Jack, the missiles will launch
in less than ten minutes.

135
00:10:01,967 --> 00:10:03,958
Copy that.

136
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:08,597
How long to cancel the launch sequence?

137
00:10:08,688 --> 00:10:13,126
I won't know until I see
how their targeting software's configured.

138
00:10:13,209 --> 00:10:15,962
- The petty officer is back on.
- Patch him through.

139
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:18,439
Petty Officer Rooney,
you're on with Jack Bauer.

140
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:22,490
<i>- What's your position, son?
- I'm 30 feet forward of the hatch.</i>

141
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:26,928
Have you got a visual
of the hostile guarding the hatch?

142
00:10:27,012 --> 00:10:29,242
Yeah, he's still there.

143
00:10:29,332 --> 00:10:31,482
- What do you want me to do?
- You need to kill him

144
00:10:31,572 --> 00:10:33,848
<i>without alerting the others.</i>

145
00:10:33,932 --> 00:10:36,527
<i>- Are you right-handed or left-handed?
- Right.</i>

146
00:10:36,613 --> 00:10:39,571
Approach him from behind.
When you're within 18 inches,

147
00:10:39,654 --> 00:10:44,251
put your left hand on his mouth, pull his head
back onto your chest, exposing his neck,

148
00:10:44,334 --> 00:10:48,169
- then take your right hand and slit his throat.
- Oh, my God.

149
00:10:48,255 --> 00:10:53,728
You need to cut deep to sever the vocal cords
and the carotid artery.

150
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:57,934
I- I don't... I don't know if I can do this.

151
00:10:58,017 --> 00:11:00,054
You don't have a choice, son.

152
00:11:00,977 --> 00:11:03,970
You need to focus on the objective.

153
00:11:04,898 --> 00:11:08,174
You cannot afford to think about this, son.
You need to do it.

154
00:11:08,259 --> 00:11:10,693
There's less than nine minutes till the launch.

155
00:11:12,499 --> 00:11:14,013
Petty Officer Rooney?

156
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:21,293
<i>Petty Officer Rooney?</i>

157
00:11:21,381 --> 00:11:24,931
OK, I can do this. I have to do this.

158
00:11:25,022 --> 00:11:27,900
Cut him deep and cut him fast.

159
00:11:28,343 --> 00:11:33,417
Agent McCullough, cover us.
We're moving in on the tower. Go.

160
00:12:06,109 --> 00:12:08,384
Petty Officer Rooney, what is your status?

161
00:12:08,469 --> 00:12:10,745
My status is, uh... He's dead.

162
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:13,344
Did anyone hear you?

163
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:16,104
- No, no one's coming.
- Good. Open the hatch.

164
00:12:24,152 --> 00:12:25,426
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

165
00:12:25,513 --> 00:12:28,107
I'll take out the guard. Let's go.

166
00:12:32,593 --> 00:12:34,630
The guard is down. We're going in.

167
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:53,911
Oh, no. The sub's missile hatch
has just opened.

168
00:12:53,997 --> 00:12:57,388
I see them. What does that mean
in terms of our timeframe?

169
00:12:57,478 --> 00:12:59,913
You have less than seven minutes.

170
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,993
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm OK.

171
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,753
Which way's the control room?

172
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:13,309
- You lead, we'll follow.
- OK.

173
00:13:28,364 --> 00:13:30,480
The control room's down that hall.

174
00:13:30,564 --> 00:13:33,317
I'll need your help drawing the hostiles out.

175
00:13:33,405 --> 00:13:37,684
- What do you want me to do?
- Is there another way into the control room?

176
00:13:37,765 --> 00:13:40,405
I can go down one level
and come up behind them.

177
00:13:40,485 --> 00:13:45,117
OK. When you get there, create a diversion.
Something loud, just get them out of there.

178
00:13:45,207 --> 00:13:50,282
Then lay low and stay there.
Do not engage them, do you understand?

179
00:13:50,367 --> 00:13:52,438
- Yeah, I can do that.
- Go.

180
00:14:11,011 --> 00:14:17,282
With the last three missiles, overlap
these population centres in San Francisco.

181
00:14:19,973 --> 00:14:22,771
Looking up GPS coordinates, sir.

182
00:14:33,335 --> 00:14:35,804
Keep working.

183
00:14:43,417 --> 00:14:45,612
- Did you hear that?
- Yes, sir. Down there.

184
00:14:45,697 --> 00:14:47,893
Come with me, both of you.

185
00:15:11,382 --> 00:15:14,533
The control room's right behind us.

186
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:22,218
I have a visual on one hostile. Agent
McCullough, I'm moving into position.

187
00:15:22,304 --> 00:15:26,900
When he's directly above me,
signal me with the mirror.

188
00:15:59,271 --> 00:16:02,308
Jack, the missiles are armed.
Three minutes till launch.

189
00:16:13,993 --> 00:16:15,984
We're all clear.

190
00:16:32,156 --> 00:16:35,627
- I have to manually reverse all these codes.
- Do you have enough time?

191
00:16:35,717 --> 00:16:39,836
I'll do my best. I don't wanna be in here any
more than you if the F-18s take out the sub.

192
00:16:39,917 --> 00:16:43,878
We'll keep Bierko and his men out
so you can finish this. Let's go.

193
00:17:31,007 --> 00:17:34,683
Agent McCullough's down.
Bierko and one hostile remaining.

194
00:17:34,768 --> 00:17:38,842
- Henderson, what is your status?
- I need more time. Hold 'em off.

195
00:17:38,928 --> 00:17:41,682
60 seconds until they launch.

196
00:18:12,335 --> 00:18:14,565
Jack?

197
00:18:14,975 --> 00:18:17,284
Hang on, Jack.

198
00:18:22,536 --> 00:18:24,333
Aaargh!

199
00:18:26,537 --> 00:18:28,368
I'm almost there, Jack.

200
00:18:34,699 --> 00:18:36,132
A few more seconds.

201
00:18:37,939 --> 00:18:39,691
<i>Ten seconds.</i>

202
00:18:43,379 --> 00:18:45,212
It's done.

203
00:18:55,422 --> 00:19:00,258
<i>Launch sequence is cancelled.
I repeat. Launch sequence is cancelled.</i>

204
00:19:00,343 --> 00:19:02,857
- Audrey, recall the F-18s.
- I'm on it.

205
00:19:03,504 --> 00:19:06,177
Bierko's dead. Submarine is secure.

206
00:19:06,264 --> 00:19:08,824
<i>- Jack, are you OK?
- Bill, I'm fine.</i>

207
00:19:12,225 --> 00:19:17,425
<i>- I'm getting feedback. Take me off the com.
- OK, Jack.</i>

208
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:36,666
Hold it, Jack!

209
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:43,990
Now lower your arms, real slow,
and turn around.

210
00:19:47,672 --> 00:19:50,948
You were never really
gonna let me go, were you?

211
00:19:51,032 --> 00:19:52,101
No.

212
00:20:14,036 --> 00:20:16,028
Good for you, Jack.

213
00:20:20,078 --> 00:20:27,554
You were responsible for the deaths of David
Palmer, Tony Almeida and Michelle Dessler.

214
00:20:27,639 --> 00:20:29,630
They were friends of mine.

215
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,870
That's the way it works.

216
00:21:27,609 --> 00:21:29,805
- Hands above your head!
- Identify yourself!

217
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:35,488
Jack Bauer, with the Counter Terrorist Unit,
Los Angeles. All the hostiles are dead.

218
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:37,562
Holster your weapons!

219
00:21:39,092 --> 00:21:41,970
Sir, you need to contact
Bill Buchanan immediately.

220
00:21:42,052 --> 00:21:44,691
OK. Lieutenant, I need access to a vehicle.

221
00:21:44,772 --> 00:21:47,161
Petty Officer, get me a vehicle, now!

222
00:21:47,253 --> 00:21:49,244
Thank you.

223
00:21:52,173 --> 00:21:53,209
<i>- Jack?
- Yeah.</i>

224
00:21:53,294 --> 00:21:55,809
The navy's running cleanup
and security on the sub.

225
00:21:55,894 --> 00:21:58,807
Yeah, they're here now.
Christopher Henderson's dead.

226
00:21:58,895 --> 00:22:00,487
What? What happened?

227
00:22:00,575 --> 00:22:04,045
He fired on me. I didn't have a choice.

228
00:22:06,456 --> 00:22:09,210
- Are you coming back to CTU?
- Yeah, I'll be there soon.

229
00:22:09,297 --> 00:22:12,846
- All right, we'll see you then.
- Chloe, the navy needs access to our logs

230
00:22:12,937 --> 00:22:16,772
so they can use them for their report.
Can you pick up?

231
00:22:16,858 --> 00:22:21,250
- What codes do they need?
- They don't. Get somewhere private.

232
00:22:21,339 --> 00:22:25,253
I'll have to get that from my screen.
Let me get back to my station.

233
00:22:35,781 --> 00:22:37,659
I'm here. What's going on?

234
00:22:37,742 --> 00:22:41,622
- I'm not coming back. I'm going after Logan.
- What do you mean?

235
00:22:41,702 --> 00:22:45,139
I'll fill you in later. Now I need you
to walk me through modifying

236
00:22:45,223 --> 00:22:47,373
some field communications equipment.

237
00:22:47,463 --> 00:22:50,695
- That's not exactly my area.
- Then get some help.

238
00:22:52,944 --> 00:22:55,300
Chloe, are you with me on this?

239
00:22:59,066 --> 00:23:03,538
- Yeah. What do you need?
- Hold on. I'll give you a list.

240
00:23:04,987 --> 00:23:06,978
OK.

241
00:23:09,228 --> 00:23:11,583
The missiles no longer pose a threat?

242
00:23:11,668 --> 00:23:14,819
Yes, Mr. President.
We have complete control of the boat.

243
00:23:14,908 --> 00:23:20,461
And Vladimir Bierko and all his known
associates are dead or in custody.

244
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:25,947
- So, then, it's all over, Mike?
- It's all over.

245
00:23:42,753 --> 00:23:45,426
I'll make a statement
before I go back to Washington.

246
00:23:45,514 --> 00:23:51,590
- About the successful resolution of the crisis.
- Yes, and about David Palmer.

247
00:23:51,675 --> 00:23:52,664
Sir?

248
00:23:52,755 --> 00:23:57,989
His cask is being flown to Arlington for burial.
I'd like to say a few words at the airfield.

249
00:23:58,077 --> 00:24:01,433
And then I'll fly back to Washington.

250
00:24:02,637 --> 00:24:07,473
- I'll get to work on it right away.
- Good. Thanks, Mike... for everything.

251
00:24:12,599 --> 00:24:14,396
It's been a hell of a day.

252
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:18,229
Yes, sir. It has.

253
00:24:30,282 --> 00:24:32,478
Mike?

254
00:24:32,562 --> 00:24:35,031
- You need to come with me.
- Come with you?

255
00:24:35,123 --> 00:24:36,920
Please.

256
00:24:37,963 --> 00:24:40,033
Oh, please.

257
00:24:41,804 --> 00:24:45,081
- Mrs. Logan, have you been...?
- No, I...

258
00:24:46,085 --> 00:24:48,440
I've never been more sober.

259
00:24:48,525 --> 00:24:50,641
Or more sane.

260
00:24:54,806 --> 00:24:57,002
- What's this about?
- My husband.

261
00:24:57,086 --> 00:24:58,440
What about him?

262
00:24:58,527 --> 00:25:01,360
I know you've been troubled
by Charles's actions today.

263
00:25:01,448 --> 00:25:04,565
You know that something
is terribly, terribly wrong.

264
00:25:04,648 --> 00:25:07,117
You just can't put your finger on it.

265
00:25:09,529 --> 00:25:12,601
OK. Tell me what this is about.

266
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:16,365
No, I'll show you.
It'll explain everything. Please come.

267
00:25:17,091 --> 00:25:20,367
The mission to retake the submarine
has been successful.

268
00:25:20,451 --> 00:25:21,406
So I understand.

269
00:25:21,491 --> 00:25:26,691
You'll also be interested to know Christopher
Henderson was killed during the operation.

270
00:25:26,772 --> 00:25:31,927
- You're certain of this?
- CTU has confirmed the information.

271
00:25:32,013 --> 00:25:37,213
That's excellent. But let's not fool ourselves
into thinking that's the end of our problems.

272
00:25:37,294 --> 00:25:39,763
There's still Bauer to deal with.

273
00:25:39,855 --> 00:25:41,846
Don't worry.

274
00:25:41,935 --> 00:25:44,403
Mr. Bauer will be taken care of.

275
00:25:45,575 --> 00:25:46,645
Good.

276
00:25:49,376 --> 00:25:51,367
Mike, over here.

277
00:25:54,016 --> 00:25:55,769
Aaron, what happened to you?

278
00:25:55,857 --> 00:26:00,329
Agent Adams tried to kill me,
on the president's orders.

279
00:26:00,418 --> 00:26:02,808
That doesn't make any sense.

280
00:26:04,099 --> 00:26:06,135
Where's Agent Adams?

281
00:26:15,861 --> 00:26:17,931
Mike, we need your help.

282
00:26:18,021 --> 00:26:20,297
My God.

283
00:26:20,381 --> 00:26:22,850
What the hell's going on here?

284
00:26:24,222 --> 00:26:27,101
The president had something to do with this?

285
00:26:27,183 --> 00:26:30,573
Everything. He was involved with
everything that happened today.

286
00:26:30,663 --> 00:26:36,933
Supplying the terrorists with the nerve gas,
the murder of David Palmer.

287
00:26:37,025 --> 00:26:40,222
- And Walt Cummings?
- Walt was just their scapegoat.

288
00:26:40,305 --> 00:26:45,221
He didn't commit suicide. He was murdered
by a man who works for Charles.

289
00:26:45,306 --> 00:26:48,104
Charles told me to be quiet
for the good of the country.

290
00:26:48,187 --> 00:26:50,303
Keep my mouth shut.

291
00:26:50,387 --> 00:26:52,537
I can't do that, not any more.

292
00:26:55,508 --> 00:26:56,497
Do you have proof?

293
00:26:56,588 --> 00:27:00,582
Jack Bauer was in possession of
a recording that implicated the president.

294
00:27:00,669 --> 00:27:05,266
That's why Logan was willing to go so far
as to shoot a plane full of people down.

295
00:27:05,349 --> 00:27:07,944
Because Jack was on it.

296
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:12,149
- Where is this recording?
- It's been destroyed.

297
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:18,262
I didn't want to believe it either, Mike,
but it's the truth, so help me God.

298
00:27:23,313 --> 00:27:24,871
All right.

299
00:27:24,953 --> 00:27:29,823
If this is true, we need to find another way
to make a case against the president.

300
00:27:29,914 --> 00:27:33,225
You're right, but first
we have to get Aaron off the ranch.

301
00:27:33,315 --> 00:27:35,704
There can't be a record of it.

302
00:27:40,676 --> 00:27:43,110
All right, all right. We need to move fast.

303
00:27:43,197 --> 00:27:48,067
I know the man at the western gate well.
They won't inspect the vehicle if I'm driving.

304
00:27:48,157 --> 00:27:50,911
- Hide in the back, out of sight.
- Thank you, Mike.

305
00:27:50,998 --> 00:27:52,989
Give me the keys.

306
00:27:57,319 --> 00:27:59,389
Aaron.

307
00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:04,156
I'll be fine.

308
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,710
I'll go somewhere
your husband's people can't find me.

309
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:11,237
Will you let me know that you're all right?

310
00:28:11,322 --> 00:28:15,794
It's probably safer
if we don't have any contact.

311
00:28:20,723 --> 00:28:22,237
Goodbye, Aaron.

312
00:28:28,325 --> 00:28:30,555
Thank you.

313
00:29:13,388 --> 00:29:15,620
<i>- Mike Novick.
- Mike, it's Jack Bauer.</i>

314
00:29:15,709 --> 00:29:19,020
I know this is an unusual request,
but I'm looking for Aaron Pierce.

315
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:20,941
I can't reach him on his cell.

316
00:29:21,031 --> 00:29:24,660
- It's Jack Bauer. He's trying to find you.
- Put him on speaker.

317
00:29:24,751 --> 00:29:28,665
- Aaron's with me right now, Jack. Hold on.
- It's all right, Jack.

318
00:29:28,751 --> 00:29:31,825
You can speak freely in front of Mike.
He knows what I know.

319
00:29:31,912 --> 00:29:32,822
Where are you?

320
00:29:32,912 --> 00:29:35,985
- A few miles from the ranch.
- What happened?

321
00:29:36,073 --> 00:29:39,827
The president tried to have me killed,
but Mrs. Logan saved my life.

322
00:29:39,914 --> 00:29:45,148
- We decided to bring Mike into this.
- I'm still trying to process it. It's a real mess.

323
00:29:45,234 --> 00:29:48,830
I'm calling Aaron because I need his help.
I need yours too.

324
00:29:48,915 --> 00:29:52,795
- Help with what?
- Bringing President Logan to justice.

325
00:29:52,876 --> 00:29:56,870
Aaron said the recording implicating him
was destroyed. Is that true?

326
00:29:56,957 --> 00:29:59,630
- Yes.
- Without it, you can't mount a case.

327
00:29:59,717 --> 00:30:02,278
I can if I can get
a direct confession from Logan.

328
00:30:02,357 --> 00:30:05,509
Someone inside CTU is
setting up a digital uplink.

329
00:30:05,598 --> 00:30:09,387
If I can get Logan to acknowledge
everything he's done, that's all we need.

330
00:30:09,479 --> 00:30:12,915
Jack, if you intend
to physically coerce the president...

331
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,276
We need to do this now. The longer
we wait, the more vulnerable we are.

332
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,591
Logan tried to take me out, like he did Aaron.

333
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:21,912
He was responsible for
David Palmer's assassination

334
00:30:22,001 --> 00:30:24,151
and a terrorist attack on US soil.

335
00:30:24,242 --> 00:30:28,315
He cannot be allowed to remain in office,
not for one more day.

336
00:30:28,403 --> 00:30:29,882
How long till you get here?

337
00:30:29,962 --> 00:30:33,797
- 20 minutes.
- That's too late. Logan will be gone.

338
00:30:33,884 --> 00:30:36,078
He's leaving for Washington then.

339
00:30:36,164 --> 00:30:38,724
- Then you have to delay him.
- I'm not sure I can.

340
00:30:38,804 --> 00:30:41,399
Mike, just tell me you'll try.

341
00:30:43,725 --> 00:30:46,922
All right, but get here as fast as you can.

342
00:30:47,006 --> 00:30:47,881
OK, thank you.

343
00:30:49,406 --> 00:30:51,238
<i>- You understand?
- Yes, sir.</i>

344
00:30:51,326 --> 00:30:53,921
I'll go as soon as I finish
our debrief with the navy.

345
00:30:54,007 --> 00:30:55,998
<i>Very good, Ms Hayes.</i>

346
00:31:03,769 --> 00:31:08,639
Homeland's ordered me to Washington
as soon as I've filed the Bierko case.

347
00:31:09,449 --> 00:31:11,805
The request came from the White House.

348
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:17,488
Logan's looking for an excuse to clean house.
I'm sure I'll be next.

349
00:31:19,331 --> 00:31:21,367
Come in.

350
00:31:21,452 --> 00:31:24,490
- Yes? Do you have something?
- I need an authorisation code.

351
00:31:24,572 --> 00:31:27,690
- For what?
- Access to a high-clearance workstation.

352
00:31:27,773 --> 00:31:30,571
- You already have access.
- It's for some new personnel.

353
00:31:30,654 --> 00:31:32,451
What?

354
00:31:33,574 --> 00:31:36,611
Morris? You're bringing Morris back?

355
00:31:36,695 --> 00:31:39,003
- Yes.
- Why, Chloe?

356
00:31:39,095 --> 00:31:42,087
I'm still trying to salvage something
from the recording.

357
00:31:42,176 --> 00:31:44,167
If anyone can do it, it's Morris.

358
00:31:44,256 --> 00:31:46,816
I didn't think he was
on the government payroll now.

359
00:31:46,896 --> 00:31:49,650
- He's not.
- What's he doing?

360
00:31:49,737 --> 00:31:53,014
He's selling women's shoes in Beverly Hills.

361
00:31:53,097 --> 00:31:54,770
- What?
- Is this a joke?

362
00:31:54,857 --> 00:31:58,009
No. I wouldn't have brought him in
if there was anyone else.

363
00:31:58,098 --> 00:32:00,090
Please, Mr. Buchanan.

364
00:32:07,059 --> 00:32:09,621
Thank you.

365
00:32:10,461 --> 00:32:12,212
- Bill...
- It'll be all right.

366
00:32:12,301 --> 00:32:15,851
- Who is this guy?
- Morris O'Brian.

367
00:32:15,942 --> 00:32:17,170
Chloe's ex-husband.

368
00:32:18,942 --> 00:32:22,413
Not like that. The beauty of the beast is,
if you leave these fields blank,

369
00:32:22,503 --> 00:32:26,462
it'll prompt you for a code. Ba-bing!
See that? You just saved 60 seconds.

370
00:32:26,543 --> 00:32:31,743
Two of those a day, an extra cigarette break,
or whatever it is you do to take the edge off.

371
00:32:31,824 --> 00:32:33,816
Morris!

372
00:32:35,105 --> 00:32:37,745
- What are you doing?
- Making your people more efficient.

373
00:32:37,825 --> 00:32:43,219
- You picked the most attractive one.
- Wrong. You're the most attractive one.

374
00:32:43,306 --> 00:32:47,539
- Here's your clearance.
- Surprised you got Buchanan to sign me off.

375
00:32:47,627 --> 00:32:52,577
This is a really good opportunity for you.
Why not surprise me and not screw it up?

376
00:32:52,668 --> 00:32:59,188
OK, I'll pretend this requires all my attention,
when we both know I could do it in my sleep.

377
00:32:59,269 --> 00:33:02,103
- Sit down.
- So, where is this recording?

378
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:04,750
Nothing, forget it, it's fried.

379
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:07,868
I'm missing something.
You wanted me to salvage a recording.

380
00:33:07,951 --> 00:33:10,863
That was an excuse.
I need some com unit modifications,

381
00:33:10,952 --> 00:33:15,980
a certified audio transfer rate of 6.8. I can only
get to 6.5. Can you do that without talking?

382
00:33:16,072 --> 00:33:18,666
I could, but it would be
a terrible waste of my charm.

383
00:33:18,753 --> 00:33:22,063
OK, I'm not listening any more.

384
00:33:22,153 --> 00:33:24,827
Call me when you're done. Thanks.

385
00:33:28,834 --> 00:33:33,226
<i>Behind me you can see preparations as
the casket bearing the body of David Palmer</i>

386
00:33:33,316 --> 00:33:35,147
<i>is expected shortly, to be met...</i>

387
00:33:35,236 --> 00:33:37,466
Come in.

388
00:33:41,797 --> 00:33:44,072
- Is Aaron safe?
- Yes.

389
00:33:44,718 --> 00:33:46,709
Thank God.

390
00:33:49,198 --> 00:33:51,428
I can't believe Charles is gonna do this.

391
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:55,956
With David's blood on his hands, he has the
audacity to eulogise him in front of the world.

392
00:33:56,039 --> 00:34:01,831
Mrs. Logan, I said there was no way to make
a case against your husband. I was wrong.

393
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:06,551
Jack Bauer, a former CTU agent, contacted
Aaron and me. He's on his way here now.

394
00:34:06,641 --> 00:34:10,681
- What for?
- To confront your husband directly.

395
00:34:10,762 --> 00:34:14,072
Confront him? Will he hurt him?

396
00:34:14,163 --> 00:34:18,714
Jack Bauer will do whatever it takes
to compel your husband to confess the truth.

397
00:34:18,803 --> 00:34:21,796
He's the only one I know who can do this.

398
00:34:21,884 --> 00:34:23,876
- When will he be here?
- 15 minutes.

399
00:34:23,964 --> 00:34:26,525
Charles is leaving for the airfield immediately.

400
00:34:26,605 --> 00:34:29,564
I tried to delay him,
but he wouldn't change his schedule.

401
00:34:29,645 --> 00:34:34,242
That's why I'm coming to you.
I need you to keep him here.

402
00:34:38,207 --> 00:34:40,038
Martha.

403
00:34:40,128 --> 00:34:45,566
If you want your husband brought to justice,
this is our only chance.

404
00:34:45,648 --> 00:34:48,686
You have to find a way to stall him.

405
00:35:24,375 --> 00:35:28,164
Aaron, it's good to see you.
Was Mike able to delay the president?

406
00:35:28,256 --> 00:35:31,328
He's trying, but he had to ask
Mrs. Logan for some help.

407
00:35:31,417 --> 00:35:34,329
- The first lady knows what we intend to do?
- She does.

408
00:35:34,417 --> 00:35:39,412
- Aaron, can she be trusted?
- She is with us, Jack, 100 per cent.

409
00:35:39,498 --> 00:35:41,728
Can you access
the Secret Service deployment grid?

410
00:35:41,818 --> 00:35:46,813
I have. Security's been beefed up around the
main building - you won't get him alone there.

411
00:35:46,899 --> 00:35:49,937
- Is Marine One taking him?
- No, this was last minute.

412
00:35:50,019 --> 00:35:53,217
They're moving him by reduced attachment
in a navy helicopter.

413
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:56,259
That's where this must happen.
I need to get on that chopper.

414
00:35:56,341 --> 00:36:00,254
- I don't see how that's possible.
- Get me as close to it as you can.

415
00:36:00,342 --> 00:36:02,492
We'll figure it out from there.

416
00:36:02,582 --> 00:36:05,017
All right. Let's go.

417
00:36:07,343 --> 00:36:10,938
I agree. Wayne Palmer should be
at the airfield, but if you can't find him,

418
00:36:11,023 --> 00:36:12,821
I'm not gonna wait for him.

419
00:36:12,903 --> 00:36:15,782
<i>- Will you be leaving soon?
- Yes, I'm leaving now.</i>

420
00:36:15,864 --> 00:36:16,979
<i>All right, sir.</i>

421
00:36:19,825 --> 00:36:25,503
Have a copy of my speech on the chopper.
I'll work on it on the flight over.

422
00:36:29,427 --> 00:36:33,340
- I'll be out of your way in a second.
- I saw on your schedule that...

423
00:36:33,428 --> 00:36:37,626
you're meeting David Palmer's casket
at the airfield.

424
00:36:40,109 --> 00:36:42,498
If you came to judge me, I don't have time...

425
00:36:42,589 --> 00:36:45,741
No, that's not it. I...

426
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:50,268
I've had time to reflect and I...

427
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:52,182
I think I owe you an apology.

428
00:36:57,071 --> 00:36:59,540
All right.

429
00:36:59,632 --> 00:37:06,391
- I said some horrible things to you.
- I've had horrible things said to me before.

430
00:37:06,473 --> 00:37:08,863
And by you.

431
00:37:08,954 --> 00:37:12,914
But there was one thing you said
that I can't get over.

432
00:37:12,994 --> 00:37:16,271
- What?
- That I broke your heart.

433
00:37:16,355 --> 00:37:18,347
And that you hated me.

434
00:37:20,076 --> 00:37:23,432
Well, I wish I could take those words back.

435
00:37:23,517 --> 00:37:26,475
All I can ask now is that you forgive me.

436
00:37:27,117 --> 00:37:29,108
Please, Charles.

437
00:37:34,118 --> 00:37:36,872
I don't know how to respond, Marty. I...

438
00:37:36,959 --> 00:37:41,317
I never expected you to say anything like this.

439
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,791
I mean it, Charles, I...

440
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:49,196
I mean it. I need you to forgive me.

441
00:37:49,281 --> 00:37:56,597
You mean it now, but you know how you are.
Tomorrow I could be the man you hate again.

442
00:37:56,682 --> 00:37:58,674
I know.

443
00:38:00,683 --> 00:38:04,359
It'll take time for me to prove myself to you.

444
00:38:04,443 --> 00:38:06,241
The truth is,

445
00:38:06,324 --> 00:38:10,203
even though sometimes
I don't understand you,

446
00:38:11,325 --> 00:38:13,520
I still need you.

447
00:38:15,446 --> 00:38:17,437
And I still love you.

448
00:38:17,526 --> 00:38:20,166
And that will never change, Charles.

449
00:38:20,607 --> 00:38:22,598
Not tomorrow,

450
00:38:23,607 --> 00:38:25,677
not ever.

451
00:38:28,408 --> 00:38:30,400
I need you too, Marty.

452
00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:44,406
Fly with me to Washington.

453
00:38:46,171 --> 00:38:51,451
- We could spend some time together.
- On a plane, surrounded by Secret Service?

454
00:38:51,532 --> 00:38:56,004
Why can't we just spend
a little more time here together, alone?

455
00:38:56,093 --> 00:39:01,248
You know that's not possible. I have to go.
I have to go five minutes ago.

456
00:39:07,695 --> 00:39:10,164
OK, Charles.

457
00:39:10,256 --> 00:39:12,565
You go.

458
00:39:23,538 --> 00:39:25,529
Come with me.

459
00:39:27,458 --> 00:39:29,575
I have a better idea.

460
00:39:33,739 --> 00:39:36,732
- There's a helicopter waiting for me.
- Let it wait.

461
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:40,052
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

462
00:39:40,541 --> 00:39:42,372
You're the president.

463
00:40:11,547 --> 00:40:14,983
<i>- Yes, Mr. President?
- Tell the helicopter to stand by.</i>

464
00:40:15,067 --> 00:40:17,456
Yes, until I'm ready.

465
00:40:17,547 --> 00:40:22,099
<i>- Yes, Mr. President.
- And make sure I'm not disturbed.</i>

466
00:41:02,555 --> 00:41:04,227
It's clear.

467
00:41:11,277 --> 00:41:11,914
Yeah?

468
00:41:11,997 --> 00:41:14,670
Logan just told Secret Service
he'll be delayed.

469
00:41:14,758 --> 00:41:15,588
How long?

470
00:41:15,677 --> 00:41:20,070
He didn't say, but Mrs. Logan knows
we need as much time as possible.

471
00:41:20,159 --> 00:41:21,353
Jack...

472
00:41:21,799 --> 00:41:26,157
If Logan doesn't confess,
how far are you actually willing to go?

473
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,991
As far as I have to.
