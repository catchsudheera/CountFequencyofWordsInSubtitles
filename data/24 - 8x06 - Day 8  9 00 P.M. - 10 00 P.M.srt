Hassan's security forces

3
00:00:15,197 --> 00:00:16,697
in the Islamic Republic

4
00:00:16,765 --> 00:00:17,965
are sweeping
through the capital,

5
00:00:18,033 --> 00:00:19,634
arreing opposition
leaders.

6
00:00:19,701 --> 00:00:23,271
And if he continues, it may
delegitimize the peace accord.

7
00:00:23,338 --> 00:00:25,306
<i>I can't vouch for you</i>

8
00:00:25,374 --> 00:00:26,941
as a reformer, Mr. President,

9
00:00:27,009 --> 00:00:28,409
if you renege

10
00:00:28,477 --> 00:00:30,077
on your human rights
obligations.

11
00:00:30,145 --> 00:00:32,313
My brother tried to kill me,

12
00:00:32,381 --> 00:00:33,981
helped by elements

13
00:00:34,049 --> 00:00:36,083
within my own government.

14
00:00:36,151 --> 00:00:37,652
Apparently,
killing President Hassan

15
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:39,620
was only part
of his brother's plan.

16
00:00:39,688 --> 00:00:41,455
CTU now believes
he's also trying

17
00:00:41,523 --> 00:00:43,658
to acquire weapons-grade
uranium.

18
00:00:43,725 --> 00:00:45,660
When can I take possession
of the rods?

19
00:00:45,727 --> 00:00:47,662
As soon as we have the money.

20
00:00:47,729 --> 00:00:49,597
<i>JOSEF: I found a doctor
who can treat him.</i>

21
00:00:49,665 --> 00:00:51,132
BAZHAEV:
No doctors.

22
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:53,100
The authorities know
about the nuclear material.

23
00:00:53,168 --> 00:00:54,368
Putting Oleg

24
00:00:54,436 --> 00:00:56,504
in a clinic would lead them
right to us.

25
00:00:56,571 --> 00:00:57,972
Dr. Levine.

26
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,073
How did you get in here?

27
00:00:59,141 --> 00:01:00,908
My brother is sick.
I'm gonna call you

28
00:01:00,976 --> 00:01:02,443
an ambulance.
No.

29
00:01:02,511 --> 00:01:03,945
No one can know about this.

30
00:01:04,012 --> 00:01:06,681
(gasping):
No, no.

31
00:01:06,748 --> 00:01:08,282
What do you want from me?

32
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:10,851
<i>You're a data analyst
for CTU.</i>

33
00:01:10,919 --> 00:01:13,020
You got access to all sorts
of good stuff.

34
00:01:13,088 --> 00:01:15,022
Yeah, but not unrestricted
access.

35
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:17,124
Payout's got to be at least
six figures.

36
00:01:17,192 --> 00:01:18,492
You were undercover
for nearly two years

37
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,961
with the Russian Mob.

38
00:01:20,028 --> 00:01:21,963
You're asking me to go back in?

39
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:23,864
<i>Vladimir Laitanan was</i>

40
00:01:23,932 --> 00:01:25,533
completely obsessed with her.
It turned violent.

41
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,667
Did he rape her?

42
00:01:26,735 --> 00:01:28,803
It looks like he tried
a couple of times.

43
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:30,471
Can we talk
about this deal now?

44
00:01:30,539 --> 00:01:32,039
I wish it were that simple.

45
00:01:32,107 --> 00:01:33,507
Tie her up.
What?

46
00:01:33,575 --> 00:01:34,976
Look, you're making
a mistake.

47
00:01:35,043 --> 00:01:36,677
This is the chance
of a lifetimK]

48
00:01:36,745 --> 00:01:37,878
JACK:
This operation's over.

49
00:01:37,946 --> 00:01:39,880
Vladimir didn't take the bait.

50
00:01:39,948 --> 00:01:41,649
<i>Renee, it's Jack.</i>

51
00:01:41,717 --> 00:01:42,650
I know you can hear me.

52
00:01:42,718 --> 00:01:43,884
I'm on my way now.

53
00:01:43,952 --> 00:01:45,853
You don't want
to do this deal,

54
00:01:45,921 --> 00:01:47,488
then you might as well
just kill me,

55
00:01:47,556 --> 00:01:50,324
because this deal is
the only thing that I have.

56
00:01:50,392 --> 00:01:52,326
Do it!

57
00:01:52,394 --> 00:01:53,928
Pull the trigger!

58
00:01:56,665 --> 00:01:58,199
I had to be sure.

59
00:01:59,468 --> 00:02:00,901
CHLOE:
Jack, are you there?

60
00:02:00,969 --> 00:02:01,936
What's going on?

61
00:02:02,004 --> 00:02:03,404
She's in.

62
00:02:03,472 --> 00:02:04,805
They bought her cover.

63
00:02:30,499 --> 00:02:32,967
JACK (over comm):
Renee, I've got a visual on you.

64
00:02:33,035 --> 00:02:35,269
I'm going off comm
for a minute.

65
00:02:37,305 --> 00:02:40,141
You all right?

66
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:44,412
(phone rings)

67
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:45,646
CHLOE:
CTU, O'Brian.

68
00:02:45,714 --> 00:02:47,048
Chloe, it's Jack. I want you

69
00:02:47,115 --> 00:02:48,883
to monitor Renee's comm.
I need to speak to Hastings.

70
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:50,051
Okay, I'll put you
through.

71
00:02:50,118 --> 00:02:51,085
I'm here, Jack. Go ahead.

72
00:02:51,153 --> 00:02:52,219
We need to pull
Renee Walker out now.

73
00:02:52,287 --> 00:02:53,587
Based on what?

74
00:02:53,655 --> 00:02:55,423
Because she's a danger
to herself and this mission.

75
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:57,825
Ten minutes ago, Laitanan
threatened to execute her,

76
00:02:57,893 --> 00:02:58,926
and she said
she was sick of living

77
00:02:58,994 --> 00:03:00,161
and wanted to die
and she meant it.

78
00:03:00,228 --> 00:03:01,395
She must've been
playing him.

79
00:03:01,463 --> 00:03:03,064
No. She doesn't care
what happens to her,

80
00:03:03,131 --> 00:03:04,565
that's what makes
her dangerous.

81
00:03:04,633 --> 00:03:06,233
She's like a bomb
ready to go off.

82
00:03:06,301 --> 00:03:08,636
We need to get her out of there
before that happens. Look, I understand

83
00:03:08,703 --> 00:03:10,604
your concern, but we can't
just roll up this operation

84
00:03:10,672 --> 00:03:12,406
before we find those
nuclear rods.

85
00:03:12,474 --> 00:03:13,541
We can arrest Laitanan.

86
00:03:13,608 --> 00:03:14,809
If he knows how
to find the rods,

87
00:03:14,876 --> 00:03:16,077
I will make him talk.

88
00:03:16,144 --> 00:03:17,445
If you're saying
what I think you are,

89
00:03:17,512 --> 00:03:18,879
we don't do that anymore.

90
00:03:18,947 --> 00:03:20,748
Then you people do
what you do well-

91
00:03:20,816 --> 00:03:22,249
offer him immunity
or something.

92
00:03:22,317 --> 00:03:23,918
This is the Russian
Syndicate.

93
00:03:23,985 --> 00:03:26,187
They're very secretive,
they protect their own.

94
00:03:26,254 --> 00:03:27,755
It is highly unlikely

95
00:03:27,823 --> 00:03:28,989
that Laitanan would
cooperate.

96
00:03:29,057 --> 00:03:30,224
Then you better find
another way,

97
00:03:30,292 --> 00:03:31,859
because I am not gonna
let Renee die

98
00:03:31,927 --> 00:03:33,194
because CTU did
their job badly.

99
00:03:33,261 --> 00:03:35,196
I will not let that happen.
Do you understand me?

100
00:03:35,263 --> 00:03:37,198
Jack, if you can think
of something, I will listen.

101
00:03:37,265 --> 00:03:38,532
But right now,

102
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,201
Renee's the only hope we have

103
00:03:40,268 --> 00:03:41,535
of neutralizing this threat.

104
00:03:41,603 --> 00:03:44,805
And on my order,
she stays in play.

105
00:03:47,242 --> 00:03:49,243
Jack?

106
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:53,447
I'll find a way to get her out
when I go in as the buyer.

107
00:03:53,515 --> 00:03:56,450
I'll sy under in her place.

108
00:03:56,518 --> 00:03:58,452
Do we have a deal?

109
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,955
As long as you can do it
without risking the mission.

110
00:04:01,022 --> 00:04:02,957
I give you my word.

111
00:04:03,024 --> 00:04:04,792
Agent Ortiz will meet you

112
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,794
at the staging area
with a TAC team.

113
00:04:06,862 --> 00:04:09,163
He'll have everything you need
for your cover.

114
00:04:09,231 --> 00:04:10,498
Hold on.
They're moving.

115
00:04:10,565 --> 00:04:12,133
I need to get
back on comm.

116
00:04:14,169 --> 00:04:16,103
VLADIMIR:
We'll go back to my shop,

117
00:04:16,171 --> 00:04:19,173
and we will discuss
this buyer of yours.

118
00:04:30,752 --> 00:04:32,753
(engine starts)

119
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:41,128
(tires squealing)

120
00:04:41,196 --> 00:04:42,997
HASTINGS: Dana... (gasps)

121
00:04:43,064 --> 00:04:44,665
start forwarding mission

122
00:04:44,733 --> 00:04:47,668
status reports to the Nuclear
Emergency Team at Fort Hamilton.

123
00:04:47,736 --> 00:04:50,137
I want them ready to go
in as soon as we find

124
00:04:50,205 --> 00:04:52,206
these nuclear rods.
I'm on it, sir.

125
00:05:15,397 --> 00:05:18,299
(phone rings)

126
00:05:18,366 --> 00:05:19,900
Ye.

127
00:05:19,968 --> 00:05:21,068
It's me.

128
00:05:21,136 --> 00:05:22,236
I've got something.

129
00:05:22,304 --> 00:05:23,904
Damn, you're fast.

130
00:05:23,972 --> 00:05:25,873
Okay, hold on.

131
00:05:25,941 --> 00:05:27,875
Okay, go.

132
00:05:27,943 --> 00:05:29,510
Let's hear it.

133
00:05:29,578 --> 00:05:31,378
It's an NYPD evidence lockup.

134
00:05:31,446 --> 00:05:34,582
According to the manifest,
a local vice group

135
00:05:34,649 --> 00:05:37,585
just impounded a stash
of drug money.

136
00:05:37,652 --> 00:05:39,753
It'll be held there
for the next 48 hours.

137
00:05:39,821 --> 00:05:41,188
How much?

138
00:05:41,256 --> 00:05:42,590
$120,000.

139
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,660
All right, what's the plan?

140
00:05:46,728 --> 00:05:48,095
You go in and take it.

141
00:05:50,131 --> 00:05:51,398
(chuckles)

142
00:05:51,466 --> 00:05:53,000
What do you mean,
break into a police station?

143
00:05:53,068 --> 00:05:54,435
What, are you out of your mind?

144
00:05:54,502 --> 00:05:55,836
It's not a police station.
It's a warehouse.

145
00:05:55,904 --> 00:05:57,838
Most of the security
is automated.

146
00:05:57,906 --> 00:05:59,506
I can manipulate it
from here.

147
00:05:59,574 --> 00:06:01,508
You walk in, you walk out
with the cash.

148
00:06:01,576 --> 00:06:03,410
I'll talk you through it.

149
00:06:03,478 --> 00:06:06,614
I need to access
their security codes,

150
00:06:06,681 --> 00:06:08,816
work up a keycard to get you
inside the warehouse.

151
00:06:08,883 --> 00:06:10,017
How long?

152
00:06:10,085 --> 00:06:12,219
Meet me outside CTU
in 30 minutes.

153
00:06:12,287 --> 00:06:14,221
ARLO: Did you take care
of your situation?

154
00:06:14,289 --> 00:06:15,923
Situation?

155
00:06:15,991 --> 00:06:18,292
The big mystery you had
to leave work for.

156
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,294
Oh, yeah, it's fine.

157
00:06:20,362 --> 00:06:22,229
What do you need, Arlo?

158
00:06:22,297 --> 00:06:25,065
I'm getting five percent lag
in my Drone's ABS controls.

159
00:06:25,133 --> 00:06:27,434
With everything going on,
I think I'm just running hot.

160
00:06:27,502 --> 00:06:30,104
Okay, I'll make sure
to free up some memory space

161
00:06:30,171 --> 00:06:32,439
on the auxiliary servers.

162
00:06:32,507 --> 00:06:34,108
Thanks.

163
00:06:34,175 --> 00:06:36,110
You know, if there's
something bothering you,

164
00:06:36,177 --> 00:06:38,279
you've always got
my shoulder to cry on.

165
00:06:38,346 --> 00:06:41,115
Or any other body part.

166
00:06:41,182 --> 00:06:42,650
I will keep that in mind.

167
00:06:42,717 --> 00:06:44,385
But, for now,
why don't you focus on

168
00:06:44,452 --> 00:06:45,986
running aerial support
for Walker and Bauer?

169
00:06:46,054 --> 00:06:47,454
Okay.

170
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:17,851
âª âª

171
00:07:18,887 --> 00:07:21,255
Lugo, take a break.

172
00:07:21,323 --> 00:07:23,057
I want to talk to her alone.

173
00:07:34,602 --> 00:07:36,603
All right,
you have my attention.

174
00:07:37,872 --> 00:07:39,840
Tell me about this buyer.

175
00:07:39,908 --> 00:07:42,543
His name's
Ernst Meier.

176
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:44,545
German arms dealer.

177
00:07:44,612 --> 00:07:46,447
Never heard of him.
He does most

178
00:07:46,514 --> 00:07:47,948
of his business in Asia;
he just started

179
00:07:48,016 --> 00:07:49,183
branching out
into North America.

180
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,384
What's he looking to buy?

181
00:07:50,452 --> 00:07:52,152
Weapons-grade uranium.

182
00:07:54,189 --> 00:07:56,323
You're serious.

183
00:07:56,391 --> 00:07:57,624
Very.

184
00:07:57,692 --> 00:08:00,694
Someone in the Russian
Syndicate smuggled nuclear

185
00:08:00,762 --> 00:08:02,529
fuel rods out of the Ukraine.

186
00:08:02,597 --> 00:08:04,198
They're planning on selling them
on the open market.

187
00:08:06,234 --> 00:08:09,303
I... I have no idea
what you're talking about.

188
00:08:09,371 --> 00:08:11,305
I don't, Renee.

189
00:08:11,373 --> 00:08:12,873
But you can find out.

190
00:08:12,941 --> 00:08:15,876
You're very well
connected.

191
00:08:15,944 --> 00:08:19,413
I have always admired
your ambition,

192
00:08:19,481 --> 00:08:21,415
but you're chasing
the devil.

193
00:08:21,483 --> 00:08:22,916
Dealing AK-47s-

194
00:08:22,984 --> 00:08:24,918
no one really cares.

195
00:08:24,986 --> 00:08:27,888
But nuclear material?

196
00:08:27,956 --> 00:08:30,290
But the profit is worth it.

197
00:08:32,327 --> 00:08:35,028
You need money, huh?

198
00:08:35,096 --> 00:08:37,064
You can always
come work for me.

199
00:08:37,132 --> 00:08:40,434
No, I'm doing this so I don't
ever have to work for anyone.

200
00:08:41,469 --> 00:08:43,370
Have a seat.

201
00:08:43,438 --> 00:08:45,739
If I could find out...

202
00:08:46,775 --> 00:08:49,143
...what would it be worth?

203
00:08:50,178 --> 00:08:52,413
30% of the deal.

204
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,014
I don't have
to tell you,

205
00:08:54,082 --> 00:08:55,883
that is more money than
you could possibly know

206
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:58,252
what to do with.

207
00:08:58,319 --> 00:09:01,922
Look, Meier says these rods
are going to be sold soon,

208
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:03,524
so if we want
to make a counter bid,

209
00:09:03,591 --> 00:09:05,058
it has to happen fast.

210
00:09:05,126 --> 00:09:08,695
If you don't know anything, tell
me, so I can go somewhere else.

211
00:09:08,763 --> 00:09:10,998
How well
do you know this man?

212
00:09:11,065 --> 00:09:12,199
You trust him?

213
00:09:12,267 --> 00:09:14,201
There's no one I trust more.

214
00:09:14,269 --> 00:09:15,736
I've been with him
for two years.

215
00:09:15,804 --> 00:09:17,771
What do you mean "with"?

216
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,406
It's professional.

217
00:09:21,276 --> 00:09:23,877
Can you help us or not?

218
00:09:29,117 --> 00:09:31,585
I'll make a few calls,

219
00:09:31,653 --> 00:09:33,587
see what I can
find out.

220
00:09:33,655 --> 00:09:35,189
But, uh,

221
00:09:35,256 --> 00:09:36,890
I'm going to have
to meet this Meier.

222
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:38,258
And I need a good faith

223
00:09:38,326 --> 00:09:40,260
payment up front.
How much?

224
00:09:40,328 --> 00:09:41,395
Five million.

225
00:09:41,463 --> 00:09:43,964
That's a lot of money, Vlad.

226
00:09:44,032 --> 00:09:46,033
Look, I'm taking big risk
just making these calls.

227
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,267
Besides, 5 million is nothing

228
00:09:47,335 --> 00:09:49,136
compared to what your
buyer will have to pay

229
00:09:49,204 --> 00:09:51,805
for nuclear fuel rods.

230
00:09:51,873 --> 00:09:53,807
Fine.

231
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:56,610
I'll ask him, but I can't
make any promises.

232
00:09:56,678 --> 00:09:59,279
If he wants my help,
that's the price

233
00:09:59,347 --> 00:10:01,114
of admission.
Okay.

234
00:10:01,182 --> 00:10:03,450
There's a parking garage

235
00:10:03,518 --> 00:10:05,118
on the corner of 12th
and Market Street.

236
00:10:05,186 --> 00:10:07,988
Someone will meet him
there, on the roof.

237
00:10:08,056 --> 00:10:10,557
Once the money is
in our account,

238
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:13,393
they'll bring him back here,
we will talk.

239
00:10:13,461 --> 00:10:15,863
I'll give him a call.

240
00:10:17,899 --> 00:10:19,533
It's good to see you.

241
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:25,939
You're going to make me
start losing sleep again.

242
00:10:27,976 --> 00:10:29,710
I'll let you know
what Meier says.

243
00:10:30,745 --> 00:10:32,679
I'll tell my men.

244
00:10:32,747 --> 00:10:35,749
I'll give you privacy
for your call.

245
00:11:07,282 --> 00:11:08,348
Jack, were you listening?

246
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:09,483
Yeah, we're ready to wire

247
00:11:09,551 --> 00:11:10,551
the money to
his account.

248
00:11:10,618 --> 00:11:11,652
When can you be there?

249
00:11:11,719 --> 00:11:13,287
As soon as I finish
prepping my cover.

250
00:11:13,354 --> 00:11:14,621
I'm almost at the
staging area.

251
00:11:14,689 --> 00:11:16,590
30 minutes tops.

252
00:11:17,725 --> 00:11:18,992
How you holding up?

253
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:20,761
It's hard to be
in the same room

254
00:11:20,828 --> 00:11:22,496
with this
son of a bitch.

255
00:11:22,564 --> 00:11:23,897
I can handle it.

256
00:11:23,965 --> 00:11:26,199
I'll be there as
soon as I can.

257
00:11:26,267 --> 00:11:28,068
Okay.

258
00:11:46,056 --> 00:11:47,556
Don't worry, Oleg.

259
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:49,091
You're going to be fine.

260
00:11:50,427 --> 00:11:52,094
It, uh... it might
help me if I knew

261
00:11:52,162 --> 00:11:53,929
exactly what happened
to your brother.

262
00:11:53,997 --> 00:11:57,399
How did he get exposed
to weapons-grade uranium?

263
00:11:57,467 --> 00:11:59,034
Don't worry about that.

264
00:11:59,102 --> 00:12:00,969
Just make sure he lives.

265
00:12:02,405 --> 00:12:04,406
(phone ringing)

266
00:12:08,078 --> 00:12:09,978
It's him again, isn't it?

267
00:12:10,046 --> 00:12:11,780
The second time he's called.

268
00:12:11,848 --> 00:12:13,549
You should
answer it.

269
00:12:17,921 --> 00:12:19,054
Hello?

270
00:12:19,122 --> 00:12:20,489
Why aren't you
picking up your phone?

271
00:12:20,557 --> 00:12:21,724
I called you twice.

272
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:23,292
Must have been
in the tunnel.

273
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,761
Ulana says you're not
at the house yet.

274
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:27,229
Where are you?
Stuck in traffic.

275
00:12:27,297 --> 00:12:28,964
Tell her it's going
to be a while.

276
00:12:29,032 --> 00:12:30,032
How's Oleg?

277
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,100
He's okay.

278
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:32,434
Sleeping.

279
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:34,737
Let me know when you
get to the house.

280
00:12:34,804 --> 00:12:36,305
I will.

281
00:12:37,741 --> 00:12:39,308
It was him, wasn't it?

282
00:12:41,711 --> 00:12:43,879
Hey.

283
00:12:43,947 --> 00:12:45,314
Don't worry, okay?

284
00:12:45,382 --> 00:12:46,949
By the time he finds out,

285
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:50,285
you'll already
have been treated.

286
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:52,087
Then it won't matter.

287
00:12:54,324 --> 00:12:56,592
(knock on door)

288
00:12:56,659 --> 00:12:58,527
Hey, it's just
your brother's test results.

289
00:13:01,297 --> 00:13:02,464
Okay.

290
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:06,135
You say or do anything
that I don't like,

291
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:08,237
and my men will kill
your wife and daughter.

292
00:13:08,304 --> 00:13:10,139
Open the door.

293
00:13:12,142 --> 00:13:13,709
The blood work
you ordered, Doctor.

294
00:13:13,777 --> 00:13:14,943
Thank you.

295
00:13:15,011 --> 00:13:16,278
Uh, I noticed there was

296
00:13:16,346 --> 00:13:18,147
no patient name.
Uh, yeah, you're right.

297
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:20,616
I forgot to put that down.
Oh, well, I can do it for you.

298
00:13:20,683 --> 00:13:21,650
No, I'll take care of it later.

299
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:23,519
Is everything okay, Doctor?

300
00:13:24,921 --> 00:13:26,255
Fine.

301
00:13:26,322 --> 00:13:27,856
I'm just working a little later

302
00:13:27,924 --> 00:13:29,992
than I expected.
Okay.

303
00:13:33,696 --> 00:13:35,330
You did good.

304
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:36,965
What does it say?

305
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:42,404
Your brother has been exposed
to at least 400 rems,

306
00:13:42,472 --> 00:13:43,605
and the chemical toxicity

307
00:13:43,673 --> 00:13:45,307
of the radiation
is causing renal failure.

308
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:47,209
I know it's serious.

309
00:13:47,277 --> 00:13:49,111
Can you help him or not?

310
00:13:49,179 --> 00:13:50,679
He needs
a bone marrow transplant.

311
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:52,181
That requires
a six-man surgical team

312
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:53,515
in a fully equipped facility.

313
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:55,717
There has to be something
you can do

314
00:13:55,785 --> 00:13:58,220
right here, right now.

315
00:13:58,288 --> 00:13:59,855
There are some drugs
I could give him

316
00:13:59,923 --> 00:14:01,290
that will help
flush out the radiation

317
00:14:01,357 --> 00:14:02,825
and stimulate
white blood cell repair,

318
00:14:02,892 --> 00:14:04,793
but that's a half measure.

319
00:14:04,861 --> 00:14:05,961
I can't guarantee

320
00:14:06,029 --> 00:14:07,396
he'll recover.

321
00:14:09,232 --> 00:14:11,800
My brother is not going to die.

322
00:14:11,868 --> 00:14:14,002
It's up to you, Doctor.

323
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:17,372
Now get to work.

324
00:14:26,382 --> 00:14:28,217
Okay, got it.

325
00:14:29,819 --> 00:14:31,220
That was CTU.

326
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:32,554
Your offshore
account's in place.

327
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:33,856
They're forwarding
instructions to your PDA

328
00:14:33,923 --> 00:14:35,157
on how to wire
the money.

329
00:14:35,225 --> 00:14:36,525
Excuse me.

330
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,494
I spoke
with Hastings.

331
00:14:38,561 --> 00:14:39,862
He said, as soon
as you're under

332
00:14:39,929 --> 00:14:42,431
and we have confirmation
that Laitanan can get us

333
00:14:42,499 --> 00:14:44,366
to the nuclear rods,
we're pulling Renee Walker out.

334
00:14:44,434 --> 00:14:45,868
That's right.

335
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:48,537
What's going on, Jack?

336
00:14:48,605 --> 00:14:50,339
Hastings said something
about her being unstable.

337
00:14:50,406 --> 00:14:52,040
I don't have time
to explain it.

338
00:14:52,108 --> 00:14:53,575
Just follow my lead.

339
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:55,377
How do you want to work this
without breaking cover?

340
00:14:55,445 --> 00:14:56,612
I don't know yet.

341
00:14:56,679 --> 00:14:58,380
All right.
Well, I got two teams

342
00:14:58,448 --> 00:14:59,781
running coordinated
drive-bys.

343
00:14:59,849 --> 00:15:00,883
They'll be ready to extract her

344
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:01,884
when she's clear.
No.

345
00:15:01,951 --> 00:15:02,885
These guys own
this neighborhood.

346
00:15:02,952 --> 00:15:03,919
They'll have eyes everywhere.

347
00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:05,254
Your men
will run the risk

348
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:07,089
of being spotted.
I've done this before, Jack.

349
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,157
I ran an operation just
like it in Fallujah.

350
00:15:09,225 --> 00:15:10,359
And I'm in command.

351
00:15:10,426 --> 00:15:12,327
You're going to do
exactly what I tell you.

352
00:15:12,395 --> 00:15:13,762
RENEE (over comm):
Jack, stand by.

353
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:15,597
I hear him coming.

354
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:17,032
Laitanan's back.

355
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,267
I need to listen to this.

356
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:19,935
Excuse me.

357
00:15:22,005 --> 00:15:22,938
(knock on door)

358
00:15:23,006 --> 00:15:25,040
VLADIMIR:
Renee.

359
00:15:26,075 --> 00:15:27,609
I spoke to my men.

360
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:29,545
Did you get your buyer
on the phone?

361
00:15:29,612 --> 00:15:31,013
He agreed
to the money.

362
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,881
He'll be at the parking garage
in 20 minutes. Very good.

363
00:15:32,949 --> 00:15:35,484
We have a little time
to catch up.

364
00:15:35,552 --> 00:15:37,185
Do you still like
your single malts?

365
00:15:37,253 --> 00:15:38,220
Uh, not right now.

366
00:15:38,288 --> 00:15:39,388
You sure?
It's a 30 year.

367
00:15:39,455 --> 00:15:41,089
No, thanks.

368
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:46,128
What you said earlier-
down at the river-

369
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:48,163
you were tired
of living,

370
00:15:48,231 --> 00:15:50,165
wanted to die.

371
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:54,102
What happened to you?

372
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:55,637
It's not important.

373
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:57,739
It is to me.

374
00:15:57,807 --> 00:15:59,908
Look, you don't have
to worry about it.

375
00:15:59,976 --> 00:16:03,545
Once I make this deal,
none of it will matter.

376
00:16:03,613 --> 00:16:05,180
Well, you're not the only one

377
00:16:05,248 --> 00:16:07,282
who's been suffering
these past few years.

378
00:16:12,155 --> 00:16:14,723
It's hard for
me to admit,

379
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:17,092
but, uh...

380
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:20,996
I never forgave myself
for what I did to you.

381
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:25,901
It's in the past.

382
00:16:25,969 --> 00:16:27,502
Forget it.

383
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:29,938
VLADIMIR (over comm):
I don't want to forget it.

384
00:16:30,006 --> 00:16:32,207
I had too much
to drink that night,

385
00:16:32,275 --> 00:16:33,976
I wasn't thinking clearly.

386
00:16:34,043 --> 00:16:36,244
Wow.

387
00:16:36,312 --> 00:16:38,647
Never heard you apologize
for anything.

388
00:16:38,715 --> 00:16:40,482
It's definitely
a first.

389
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:42,150
Look, I'm just trying
to make things right.

390
00:16:42,218 --> 00:16:44,219
You dot have to be
such a bitch about it.

391
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:46,088
Was I being a bitch?
Maybe I should apologize.

392
00:16:46,155 --> 00:16:47,289
Oh, you're
something else.

393
00:16:47,357 --> 00:16:49,124
You never back
down, do you?

394
00:16:51,961 --> 00:16:54,930
I've missed our
little arguments.

395
00:17:04,474 --> 00:17:06,508
You're still
nervous around me.

396
00:17:07,543 --> 00:17:09,144
I shouldn't be surprised.

397
00:17:10,179 --> 00:17:11,380
It's not you.

398
00:17:12,515 --> 00:17:13,982
VLADIMIR:
Someone else?

399
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:15,517
RENEE:
No.

400
00:17:15,585 --> 00:17:17,452
VLADIMIR:
What is it, then?

401
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,987
Look, I'm just...

402
00:17:19,055 --> 00:17:20,389
I'm just nervous about the deal.

403
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:22,190
Could be a lot of money
at stake.

404
00:17:22,258 --> 00:17:24,826
There's more for you here
than just money,

405
00:17:24,894 --> 00:17:26,728
if you want it.

406
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:28,597
Look...

407
00:17:30,266 --> 00:17:32,768
I didn't come here
for this.

408
00:17:32,835 --> 00:17:35,737
Really. All the people
you could've gone to,

409
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:37,372
you knocked on my door.

410
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,940
Because you're connected.

411
00:17:39,008 --> 00:17:41,009
That's the only reason?
Yes.

412
00:17:41,077 --> 00:17:42,978
I don't believe you.

413
00:17:43,046 --> 00:17:45,213
That's your problem.

414
00:17:45,281 --> 00:17:46,615
You should watch
your tongue.

415
00:17:46,683 --> 00:17:48,884
You might lose
it one day.

416
00:17:48,951 --> 00:17:52,387
Uh... you said
that I could get cleaned up.

417
00:17:54,023 --> 00:17:55,657
Yeah.

418
00:17:55,725 --> 00:17:57,259
Bathroom has a shower.

419
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:58,727
Thank you.
Yeah.

420
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,702
Agent Ortiz, we
need to move now.

421
00:18:06,769 --> 00:18:08,603
Now!

422
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:11,106
(releases held breath,
breathes deeply)

423
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:24,553
Renee called her buyer.

424
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:27,189
He agreed to pay
the $5 million up front.

425
00:18:27,256 --> 00:18:28,623
I want you
to meet with him.

426
00:18:28,691 --> 00:18:29,758
Take a couple men.

427
00:18:29,826 --> 00:18:30,926
This is a mistake, Vlad.

428
00:18:30,993 --> 00:18:32,294
Getting involved
in nuclear arms-

429
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:35,263
it doesn't matter how
much money is at stake.

430
00:18:35,331 --> 00:18:37,065
I have no intention

431
00:18:37,133 --> 00:18:39,167
of pursuing this deal.
What do you mean?

432
00:18:39,235 --> 00:18:41,269
When you've
picked up the buyer,

433
00:18:41,337 --> 00:18:44,039
when the money has been
transferred into our account,

434
00:18:44,107 --> 00:18:46,808
you kill him, put him
in the river, keep the money

435
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:48,543
for ourselves.

436
00:18:48,611 --> 00:18:50,378
What about Renee?

437
00:18:52,682 --> 00:18:55,751
She'll be working with us
from now on.

438
00:18:55,818 --> 00:18:57,619
We are going to
kill her buyer.

439
00:18:57,687 --> 00:18:59,988
She's not going to
be happy about that.

440
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:01,323
You heard what she said.

441
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,390
She's got nothing left.

442
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:03,792
Nowhere to go.
Desperate woman.

443
00:19:05,828 --> 00:19:08,096
I give her reason to live.

444
00:19:08,164 --> 00:19:09,931
Okay?

445
00:19:09,999 --> 00:19:11,933
I'll take care of it.

446
00:19:28,364 --> 00:19:30,065
President Hassan's
security forces-

447
00:19:30,133 --> 00:19:31,967
they're still cracking
down on the opposition,

448
00:19:32,035 --> 00:19:33,168
and they're not showing

449
00:19:33,236 --> 00:19:34,803
any signs
of letting up.

450
00:19:34,871 --> 00:19:36,538
ETHAN:
I'm afraid your warning

451
00:19:36,606 --> 00:19:38,707
to President Hassan
has fallen on deaf ears,

452
00:19:38,775 --> 00:19:39,741
Madam President.

453
00:19:39,809 --> 00:19:41,310
Who filmed this?

454
00:19:41,377 --> 00:19:42,678
Stringer for the BBC bought it
from an eyewitness.

455
00:19:42,745 --> 00:19:45,247
And they've already seen it
on Downing Street.

456
00:19:45,315 --> 00:19:47,049
That's why Ethan wanted you
to see this now.

457
00:19:47,116 --> 00:19:49,318
The rumors have already started
that the British

458
00:19:49,385 --> 00:19:52,421
are pulling out
as signatories to the accord.

459
00:19:52,488 --> 00:19:54,323
Then I need to talk
to the prime minister.

460
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:56,491
It's not just the British,
Madam President.

461
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:57,526
The Germans and Egyptians

462
00:19:57,593 --> 00:19:58,927
are also positioning
themselves

463
00:19:58,995 --> 00:20:00,829
to pull out, and if we
lose their support...

464
00:20:00,897 --> 00:20:02,164
The peace deal

465
00:20:02,231 --> 00:20:03,398
is dead.

466
00:20:04,867 --> 00:20:06,601
Maybe if they understood
the circumstances-

467
00:20:06,669 --> 00:20:08,503
that Hassan is trying
to prevent his brother

468
00:20:08,571 --> 00:20:10,172
from acquiring a nuclear weapon.

469
00:20:10,239 --> 00:20:11,306
With respect,
Madam President,

470
00:20:11,374 --> 00:20:12,407
sharing that intelligence

471
00:20:12,475 --> 00:20:14,142
with the delegates
might spread a panic.

472
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:18,380
You're right, but I still need
to buy some time.

473
00:20:22,719 --> 00:20:25,053
Assemble the representatives

474
00:20:25,121 --> 00:20:27,122
from every signatory country
attending the conference.

475
00:20:29,292 --> 00:20:31,760
I want to appeal to them myself
to stay the course.

476
00:20:31,828 --> 00:20:33,662
What about President Hassan?

477
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:35,664
Shouldn't we include him?

478
00:20:35,732 --> 00:20:36,999
Not until I've taken
the temperature

479
00:20:37,066 --> 00:20:38,100
of the other delegates.

480
00:20:38,167 --> 00:20:40,936
I don't want
to push him too hard.

481
00:20:49,345 --> 00:20:50,412
What is it?

482
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,614
As you requested,
these are backgrounds

483
00:20:52,682 --> 00:20:54,516
on all the detainees.

484
00:20:54,584 --> 00:20:56,752
Our security police have
completed their initial sweep

485
00:20:56,819 --> 00:20:58,053
of the capital city.

486
00:20:58,121 --> 00:20:59,855
65 known members of the
opposition have been arrested

487
00:20:59,922 --> 00:21:01,289
and are being
questioned.

488
00:21:01,357 --> 00:21:02,424
Have you learned anything?

489
00:21:02,492 --> 00:21:05,060
Were any of them working
with my brother?

490
00:21:05,128 --> 00:21:07,129
It's too early to tell.

491
00:21:11,434 --> 00:21:13,468
What's wrong, sir?

492
00:21:14,504 --> 00:21:17,706
One of the suspects...

493
00:21:17,774 --> 00:21:18,940
has family connections

494
00:21:19,008 --> 00:21:21,576
to a member of my
delegation here at the UN.

495
00:21:21,644 --> 00:21:22,778
Who?

496
00:21:22,845 --> 00:21:24,546
Jamot.

497
00:21:24,614 --> 00:21:25,814
They are cousins.

498
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:30,752
That doesn't mean that Jamot
is involved in any of this.

499
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:32,788
We need to make sure.

500
00:21:32,855 --> 00:21:35,390
We'll check his phone records
and other recent activities

501
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:36,658
for any suspicious behavior.

502
00:21:36,726 --> 00:21:38,293
Good.

503
00:21:38,361 --> 00:21:40,095
But I also want him
taken into custody.

504
00:21:40,163 --> 00:21:41,463
Sir?

505
00:21:41,531 --> 00:21:42,631
Arrest him.

506
00:21:42,698 --> 00:21:44,599
Take him to our embassy
for interrogation.

507
00:21:45,668 --> 00:21:48,136
Mr. President, with respect,

508
00:21:48,204 --> 00:21:50,572
Jamot is a trusted member
of your inner circle.

509
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,974
The evidence against him
is purely circumstantial.

510
00:21:55,978 --> 00:21:59,281
I trusted my brother as well.

511
00:22:00,516 --> 00:22:02,651
Are you sure
this is what you want?

512
00:22:02,718 --> 00:22:04,219
He is
a public official.

513
00:22:04,287 --> 00:22:05,654
It will not go
unnoticed.

514
00:22:05,721 --> 00:22:06,955
I don't care!

515
00:22:09,225 --> 00:22:11,426
I don't care what anyone thinks.

516
00:22:13,996 --> 00:22:16,631
I was almost killed today.

517
00:22:16,699 --> 00:22:17,966
Or have you forgotten?

518
00:22:18,034 --> 00:22:21,336
I was in the car
with you, sir.

519
00:22:21,404 --> 00:22:23,972
Then you should know
what needs to be done.

520
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:26,575
Yes, sir.

521
00:22:55,638 --> 00:22:58,039
(clears throat)

522
00:23:03,479 --> 00:23:05,413
ARLO:
Forget about me?

523
00:23:05,481 --> 00:23:06,414
What?

524
00:23:06,482 --> 00:23:07,549
My name's Arlo Glass.

525
00:23:07,617 --> 00:23:09,084
I'm one of your
coworkers at CTU.

526
00:23:09,152 --> 00:23:10,252
You said you'd free up

527
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:12,487
some memory space on
the auxiliary servers.

528
00:23:12,555 --> 00:23:13,922
I'm getting to it.

529
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:15,824
In which century? We're in
the middle of an operation

530
00:23:15,892 --> 00:23:17,359
and my aerial feed is
running in slow-motion.

531
00:23:17,426 --> 00:23:20,529
It's next on my list, Arlo.

532
00:23:20,596 --> 00:23:21,563
Where are you
going now?

533
00:23:21,631 --> 00:23:22,564
To the bathroom.

534
00:23:22,632 --> 00:23:24,633
Is that okay with you?

535
00:23:28,104 --> 00:23:30,038
Hey, O'Brian,

536
00:23:30,106 --> 00:23:31,673
you notice anything
weird about Dana?

537
00:23:31,741 --> 00:23:32,941
Miss Perfect?

538
00:23:33,009 --> 00:23:33,942
She seems
distracted,

539
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:35,877
always making excuses to leave.

540
00:23:35,945 --> 00:23:37,612
Maybe she's avoiding you.

541
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,047
What?
Well, that's what I would do

542
00:23:39,115 --> 00:23:40,949
if someone were drooling
over me all day.

543
00:23:41,017 --> 00:23:42,217
You're lucky she
hasn't reported you

544
00:23:42,285 --> 00:23:43,251
to Human Resources.

545
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:44,419
If you weren't so jealous,

546
00:23:44,487 --> 00:23:46,821
you'd see I was asking you
a serious question.

547
00:23:46,889 --> 00:23:48,623
Oh, yeah, I'm jealous.

548
00:23:48,691 --> 00:23:52,294
Please, won't you stare
at my ass as I walk away?

549
00:24:03,439 --> 00:24:05,373
Thank you.

550
00:24:05,441 --> 00:24:07,442
You're welcome.

551
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:14,282
Stay here.

552
00:24:23,659 --> 00:24:25,527
This has the address
and schematic

553
00:24:25,595 --> 00:24:26,895
of the evidence lockup.

554
00:24:26,963 --> 00:24:28,964
You'll go through
the southeast entrance.

555
00:24:29,031 --> 00:24:31,900
This keycard
will get you access.

556
00:24:31,968 --> 00:24:34,803
How do we find the money?

557
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:36,905
The evidence bins are numbered.

558
00:24:36,973 --> 00:24:39,941
You're looking for 4301.

559
00:24:40,009 --> 00:24:42,244
This is a dedicated comm unit.

560
00:24:42,311 --> 00:24:43,712
It's an earpiece; you'll
be able to hear me.

561
00:24:43,779 --> 00:24:45,580
Do exactly
what I tell you to do

562
00:24:45,648 --> 00:24:46,581
and you'll be in and out.

563
00:24:46,649 --> 00:24:48,016
No one will know
you were there.

564
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,455
Listen...

565
00:24:53,522 --> 00:24:57,025
I help you do this
and you never call me again.

566
00:24:57,093 --> 00:24:59,094
That's the deal, right?

567
00:25:00,129 --> 00:25:03,965
Sure, Jen, that's the deal.

568
00:25:07,003 --> 00:25:10,739
I'll call you
when we get to the lockup.

569
00:25:10,806 --> 00:25:12,540
Okay.
Okay.

570
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:43,872
(water running, turns off)

571
00:25:52,481 --> 00:25:54,482
You look thin.

572
00:25:55,518 --> 00:25:57,819
Be out in a minute.

573
00:25:57,887 --> 00:26:00,655
I don't want to wait that long.

574
00:26:00,723 --> 00:26:05,293
Vladimir, please,
just let me get dressed.

575
00:26:05,361 --> 00:26:06,695
Why waste the energy?

576
00:26:06,762 --> 00:26:09,264
I'll just have to get you
undressed all over again.

577
00:26:13,969 --> 00:26:16,805
Look, I already told you
I didn't come here for this.

578
00:26:16,872 --> 00:26:19,607
That's what you say, but part
of you came here to see me.

579
00:26:19,675 --> 00:26:20,709
Admit it.

580
00:26:20,776 --> 00:26:22,877
RENEE:
There's nothing to admit.

581
00:26:22,945 --> 00:26:25,647
VLADIMIR: Why is it so hard
for you to admit the truth?

582
00:26:26,949 --> 00:26:28,983
You want this just
as much as I do.

583
00:26:29,051 --> 00:26:30,652
I'm not going
to tell you again.

584
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,054
Leave me alone
and let me get dressed.

585
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:36,524
Come here.

586
00:26:38,561 --> 00:26:40,729
I said come here.

587
00:26:45,267 --> 00:26:46,368
(glass shatters)

588
00:26:46,435 --> 00:26:49,337
Come here or get out.

589
00:26:49,405 --> 00:26:52,207
I call my men
and the deal's off.

590
00:27:24,807 --> 00:27:28,643
I'll, um... I'll take
that drink now.

591
00:27:29,645 --> 00:27:32,280
Dry yourself off.

592
00:27:32,348 --> 00:27:33,915
Come out when
you're ready.

593
00:27:47,797 --> 00:27:50,064
JACK:
Renee, do you copy?

594
00:27:50,132 --> 00:27:51,466
Yeah, Jack.

595
00:27:51,534 --> 00:27:53,034
You don't have
to do this.

596
00:27:53,102 --> 00:27:54,269
I've got a team
standing by.

597
00:27:54,336 --> 00:27:55,637
We can get you
out of there now.

598
00:27:55,704 --> 00:27:59,073
Where would that leave us?

599
00:27:59,141 --> 00:28:00,675
I've got to stay under.

600
00:28:00,743 --> 00:28:04,712
We'll find another way.

601
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:08,416
There is no other way.

602
00:28:08,484 --> 00:28:11,953
Renee, don't do this.

603
00:28:12,021 --> 00:28:13,121
Renee...

604
00:28:13,189 --> 00:28:14,389
Go meet Vlad's men.

605
00:28:14,457 --> 00:28:15,824
I'll see you when you get here.

606
00:28:15,891 --> 00:28:17,192
Why won't you listen
to me?

607
00:28:17,259 --> 00:28:18,159
I'm going dark.

608
00:28:18,227 --> 00:28:19,461
Renee, wai...

609
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:50,602
These arrests are making
it very difficult

610
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:51,837
for my government
to continue

611
00:28:51,905 --> 00:28:53,105
to support the
peace agreement.

612
00:28:53,173 --> 00:28:54,406
President Hassan

613
00:28:54,474 --> 00:28:56,709
can't ignore the repercussions
of what he's doing.

614
00:28:56,776 --> 00:28:58,210
I know President Hassan.

615
00:28:58,278 --> 00:29:00,546
He is a rational man,
a good man.

616
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:02,181
There must be a reason
for these actions,

617
00:29:02,248 --> 00:29:04,083
and I'm not just speaking
as his delegate

618
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:05,284
but as his friend.

619
00:29:05,351 --> 00:29:06,785
Well, as his friend,
you need to let him know

620
00:29:06,853 --> 00:29:10,489
that my government is not the
only one with grave concerns.

621
00:29:10,557 --> 00:29:12,124
This conference is at
risk of falling apart...

622
00:29:12,192 --> 00:29:13,926
Excuse me,
I'm sorry to interrupt.

623
00:29:13,993 --> 00:29:16,295
Mr. Jamot, may I speak
with you privately?

624
00:29:16,362 --> 00:29:17,463
Yes, of course.

625
00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:18,464
Excuse me.

626
00:29:18,531 --> 00:29:19,465
Of course.

627
00:29:19,532 --> 00:29:21,967
What is it?

628
00:29:22,035 --> 00:29:23,402
I've been ordered
to escort you

629
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:25,037
to the embassy to
answer some questions.

630
00:29:25,105 --> 00:29:27,339
Regarding?

631
00:29:27,407 --> 00:29:28,540
An internal
security matter.

632
00:29:28,608 --> 00:29:30,709
Please come with us.

633
00:29:30,777 --> 00:29:32,044
Well, I-I would like

634
00:29:32,112 --> 00:29:33,412
to know
what this is about.

635
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,180
We'll explain everything
to you at the embassy, sir.

636
00:29:35,248 --> 00:29:36,215
Well, it will have to wait.

637
00:29:36,282 --> 00:29:37,449
I am about to go
into a meeting.

638
00:29:37,517 --> 00:29:39,351
It cannot wait, sir.

639
00:29:39,419 --> 00:29:42,821
We need to go
right now.

640
00:29:45,959 --> 00:29:48,961
Are you arresting me?

641
00:29:49,028 --> 00:29:52,030
It would be best
if we kept this discreet.

642
00:29:52,098 --> 00:29:54,666
This is outrageous.

643
00:29:54,734 --> 00:29:56,168
I demand to speak
with President Hassan.

644
00:29:56,236 --> 00:29:59,304
President Hassan is the one
who gave this order.

645
00:29:59,372 --> 00:30:01,707
I will not
ask you again.

646
00:30:01,775 --> 00:30:03,909
Come with us.

647
00:30:08,381 --> 00:30:10,315
Very well.

648
00:30:10,383 --> 00:30:11,350
Take him
to the car.

649
00:30:11,417 --> 00:30:13,418
I'll be
right there.

650
00:30:18,591 --> 00:30:20,392
Is everything all right?

651
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:21,527
Everything is fine, sir.

652
00:30:21,594 --> 00:30:22,795
Please excuse me.

653
00:30:29,102 --> 00:30:31,970
(phone rings)

654
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:33,172
Hello.

655
00:30:33,239 --> 00:30:35,040
It's me. Are you alone? Yes.

656
00:30:35,108 --> 00:30:37,075
What's wrong?
You sound upset.

657
00:30:37,143 --> 00:30:38,310
I didn't want
to burden you with this,

658
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:40,112
but I need to speak
with you about your father.

659
00:30:42,782 --> 00:30:43,849
What is it?

660
00:30:43,917 --> 00:30:45,717
I have to go to the embassy
right now.

661
00:30:45,785 --> 00:30:49,621
I'll meet you in private
when I get back.

662
00:30:49,689 --> 00:30:52,090
You're going to give him
vindesine twice daily,

663
00:30:52,158 --> 00:30:53,425
morning and night.

664
00:30:53,493 --> 00:30:55,194
Inject it right into
the I.V. bag,

665
00:30:55,261 --> 00:30:57,529
just like I'm doing.

666
00:30:57,597 --> 00:30:59,531
You're going to want
to be careful.

667
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:00,632
Radiation poisoning

668
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:03,902
is transferable
through bodily fluids.

669
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:05,637
Are you paying attention?

670
00:31:05,705 --> 00:31:07,606
Yes, I see.

671
00:31:07,674 --> 00:31:10,943
He's also going to get
cisplatin every other day,

672
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:12,611
but he can take
that in pill form.

673
00:31:12,679 --> 00:31:15,414
I'm going to give you
three weeks' worth.

674
00:31:15,481 --> 00:31:17,416
How will I know
if he's getting better?

675
00:31:17,483 --> 00:31:20,219
If the treatment's working, his
symptoms will begin to subside

676
00:31:20,286 --> 00:31:22,654
in seven to ten days.

677
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:26,124
We're going to be
leaving soon.

678
00:31:26,192 --> 00:31:27,826
Where? To the country house.

679
00:31:27,894 --> 00:31:29,494
The doctor's giving me

680
00:31:29,562 --> 00:31:31,029
everything I need
to treat y.

681
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:32,264
You're going
to get better, Oleg.

682
00:31:32,332 --> 00:31:34,299
(knocking on door)

683
00:31:34,367 --> 00:31:38,503
That's the nurse with
the rest of the medicine.

684
00:31:50,683 --> 00:31:51,717
(gunshot)

685
00:31:51,784 --> 00:31:54,786
Throw down
your weapon, Josef.

686
00:31:57,223 --> 00:31:59,558
Do what I said.

687
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:01,860
Don't make this worse
than it is.

688
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:08,867
Drop it!

689
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:17,009
You son of a bitch.

690
00:32:17,076 --> 00:32:19,778
Who else knows about
Oleg's sickness?

691
00:32:19,846 --> 00:32:21,813
Who else knows?

692
00:32:21,881 --> 00:32:22,814
Just the doctor.

693
00:32:22,882 --> 00:32:23,815
Are you sure?

694
00:32:23,883 --> 00:32:24,816
I'm sure.

695
00:32:24,884 --> 00:32:25,951
Undo him.

696
00:32:29,555 --> 00:32:31,490
Hey, wait, stop.

697
00:32:31,557 --> 00:32:33,125
What are you doing?
Your father sent us

698
00:32:33,192 --> 00:32:34,693
to bring you home.

699
00:32:34,761 --> 00:32:36,662
Now, Josef.
OLEG: Josef...

700
00:32:36,729 --> 00:32:38,063
it's okay.

701
00:32:38,131 --> 00:32:39,331
Just do what he says.

702
00:32:44,404 --> 00:32:46,538
I have him.

703
00:32:52,445 --> 00:32:54,546
We found them.

704
00:32:54,614 --> 00:32:55,580
Where were they?

705
00:32:55,648 --> 00:32:57,349
A clinic in Mount Vernon.

706
00:32:57,417 --> 00:32:59,217
How many people found out
about Oleg?

707
00:32:59,285 --> 00:33:00,852
Only one- a doctor-

708
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,087
but we've
taken care of him.

709
00:33:02,155 --> 00:33:03,388
Nobody will know
we were here.

710
00:33:03,456 --> 00:33:04,523
Good.

711
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:06,191
Now, bring my
sons to me.

712
00:33:06,259 --> 00:33:07,492
<i>Da.</i>

713
00:33:09,429 --> 00:33:11,063
Let's go.

714
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:38,557
Meier?

715
00:33:38,624 --> 00:33:40,625
That's right.

716
00:33:41,828 --> 00:33:43,328
You are from Germany.

717
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:44,930
Bremen.

718
00:33:44,998 --> 00:33:47,733
But I grew up traveling
with my father.

719
00:33:48,768 --> 00:33:50,736
(speaking German)

720
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,141
Are we going to do business
or not?

721
00:34:29,208 --> 00:34:30,575
Where is the $5 million?

722
00:34:30,643 --> 00:34:33,078
You don't see any money
until I talk to Laitanan.

723
00:34:33,146 --> 00:34:34,980
If you
have questions,

724
00:34:35,048 --> 00:34:36,114
ask me.

725
00:34:36,182 --> 00:34:37,749
I don't want to talk to you.

726
00:34:39,085 --> 00:34:40,886
Get him on the phone
or I drive away.

727
00:34:40,953 --> 00:34:42,521
Now.

728
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:54,633
(phone rings)

729
00:34:56,302 --> 00:34:57,436
Yes?

730
00:34:57,503 --> 00:34:58,837
LUGO:
Meier is here.

731
00:34:58,905 --> 00:35:00,572
He won't transfer
the money

732
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,407
until he speaks
with you first.

733
00:35:03,443 --> 00:35:04,910
Put him on.

734
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:10,682
This is Meier.

735
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:12,050
Yes, Mr. Meier.

736
00:35:12,118 --> 00:35:13,485
What's the problem?

737
00:35:13,553 --> 00:35:15,387
After you
get your money,

738
00:35:15,455 --> 00:35:17,589
how long till I get
my information?

739
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:19,524
Not very long; I just
have to make a few calls.

740
00:35:19,592 --> 00:35:20,926
No more than an hour.

741
00:35:20,993 --> 00:35:22,060
Where is Renee?

742
00:35:22,128 --> 00:35:24,229
She's busy.

743
00:35:24,297 --> 00:35:25,730
I would like
to talk to her.

744
00:35:25,798 --> 00:35:27,666
VLADIMIR: You can see
her when you get here.

745
00:35:27,733 --> 00:35:29,067
We have nothing
more to discuss

746
00:35:29,135 --> 00:35:30,135
until the money's
in place.

747
00:35:30,203 --> 00:35:31,503
Now, get Lugo
on the phone.

748
00:35:32,538 --> 00:35:34,272
Fine.

749
00:35:39,412 --> 00:35:40,879
Go ahead.

750
00:35:40,947 --> 00:35:43,115
Once the money is confirmed
into our account,

751
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:45,217
you know what to do.

752
00:35:45,284 --> 00:35:47,486
Yes.

753
00:35:48,654 --> 00:35:51,189
I need your account number.

754
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:02,801
JACK:
I'm transferring the money

755
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:04,669
through multiple accounts
so it can't be traced.

756
00:36:04,737 --> 00:36:06,705
This will take
a moment.

757
00:36:06,772 --> 00:36:08,607
We'll wait.

758
00:36:23,162 --> 00:36:24,829
Is it done?

759
00:36:24,897 --> 00:36:26,264
Not yet.

760
00:36:26,332 --> 00:36:27,966
My partner's good
for the money, Vladimir.

761
00:36:28,033 --> 00:36:29,601
You should be making calls,

762
00:36:29,668 --> 00:36:30,668
tracking down
the rods.

763
00:36:30,736 --> 00:36:32,136
I'm not going
to make any calls,

764
00:36:32,204 --> 00:36:34,072
'cause there isn't going
to be any deal

765
00:36:34,139 --> 00:36:35,139
with your partner.

766
00:36:35,207 --> 00:36:36,574
What are you talking about?

767
00:36:36,642 --> 00:36:40,011
Once we have the money...

768
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:41,112
it's over.

769
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:42,347
We don't need him anymore.

770
00:36:42,414 --> 00:36:44,482
And we'll be
$5 million richer.

771
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:46,117
You son of a bitch.

772
00:36:46,185 --> 00:36:47,852
Hey, I'm not a fool, Renee.
I'm not about

773
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,754
to get involved with the kind
of people who traffic

774
00:36:49,822 --> 00:36:51,789
in nuclear arms. Okay, Vladimir,
listen, you can't do this.

775
00:36:51,857 --> 00:36:53,658
Why? This man
mean something to you?

776
00:36:53,726 --> 00:36:55,727
No, but I worked for more
than a year to make this deal.

777
00:36:55,794 --> 00:36:57,996
I'm not just going to let it go
because you don't have the guts

778
00:36:58,063 --> 00:36:59,497
to see it through.
Hey, this isn't about guts.

779
00:36:59,565 --> 00:37:00,531
This is about being smart.

780
00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:01,633
Really?

781
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:03,234
Is it smart
to keep selling small arms

782
00:37:03,302 --> 00:37:04,435
for the rest of your life?

783
00:37:04,503 --> 00:37:05,970
I bring you the score
of a lifetime,

784
00:37:06,038 --> 00:37:07,171
and you just piss it away?

785
00:37:07,239 --> 00:37:08,206
For what- for $5 million?

786
00:37:08,274 --> 00:37:09,741
How long is that
going to last you?

787
00:37:09,808 --> 00:37:10,775
Long enough.

788
00:37:10,843 --> 00:37:12,944
You're more
than all this.

789
00:37:13,012 --> 00:37:14,646
I know it.

790
00:37:14,713 --> 00:37:17,215
It's why I brought this deal
to you.

791
00:37:19,251 --> 00:37:20,852
We can do this.

792
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:23,087
Together.

793
00:37:23,155 --> 00:37:26,958
Once we've made the deal
and we have the money,

794
00:37:27,026 --> 00:37:29,027
we can be together.

795
00:37:30,229 --> 00:37:32,864
We could start over.

796
00:37:32,932 --> 00:37:35,800
Make our own moves.

797
00:37:35,868 --> 00:37:38,303
But I need my buyer.

798
00:37:38,370 --> 00:37:40,405
Alive.

799
00:37:44,209 --> 00:37:45,643
Sorry.

800
00:37:45,711 --> 00:37:47,879
This is the
way I want it.

801
00:37:47,947 --> 00:37:49,113
You'll see.

802
00:37:49,181 --> 00:37:50,949
It's for the best.

803
00:37:53,118 --> 00:37:54,886
What are you doing?

804
00:37:54,954 --> 00:37:57,188
Making a call.

805
00:37:57,256 --> 00:37:59,190
Put down the phone.

806
00:37:59,258 --> 00:38:01,526
I said put it down!

807
00:38:04,897 --> 00:38:06,731
Don't ever
go against me!

808
00:38:08,567 --> 00:38:11,369
Renee, you should
know that by now.

809
00:38:11,437 --> 00:38:13,404
Okay?!

810
00:38:36,295 --> 00:38:37,662
How much longer?

811
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:40,198
It's almost done.

812
00:38:44,903 --> 00:38:46,437
There.

813
00:38:48,674 --> 00:38:51,175
The money's in
your account.

814
00:38:51,243 --> 00:38:52,343
LUGO:
Thank you,

815
00:38:52,411 --> 00:38:53,511
Mr. Meier.

816
00:38:53,579 --> 00:38:55,747
(gunshots)

817
00:38:59,151 --> 00:39:02,387
Drop the weapon.
Now! Drop it!

818
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,160
You really think
I'm that stupid?

819
00:39:09,228 --> 00:39:11,329
That I'd come
here alone?

820
00:39:11,397 --> 00:39:13,297
Call your man. Do it!

821
00:39:17,269 --> 00:39:19,871
Give me the phone.

822
00:39:19,938 --> 00:39:21,939
(phone ringing)

823
00:39:23,308 --> 00:39:25,076
I see we have the money.

824
00:39:25,144 --> 00:39:26,711
Is Meier dead?

825
00:39:26,779 --> 00:39:28,780
Not exactly, but I've just
taken out three of your men,

826
00:39:28,847 --> 00:39:30,882
and I'm ready
to take out the fourth.

827
00:39:30,949 --> 00:39:32,183
Meier.

828
00:39:32,251 --> 00:39:35,019
You really think you can
roll me for $5 million?

829
00:39:35,087 --> 00:39:36,721
Where's Renee?

830
00:39:36,789 --> 00:39:38,589
She's right here. She's fine.

831
00:39:38,657 --> 00:39:40,558
I want proof now!

832
00:39:41,593 --> 00:39:43,795
Say something to your partner.

833
00:39:43,862 --> 00:39:45,696
Meier, are you okay?

834
00:39:46,999 --> 00:39:48,466
Satisfied?

835
00:39:48,534 --> 00:39:50,902
Renee told me you were ready
to take your organization

836
00:39:50,969 --> 00:39:51,903
to the next level.

837
00:39:51,970 --> 00:39:53,071
Apparently, she was wrong.

838
00:39:53,138 --> 00:39:54,272
Not necessarily.

839
00:39:54,339 --> 00:39:56,207
I'm willing to reconsider
the situation.

840
00:39:56,275 --> 00:39:58,609
The only thing you should
consider yourself is lucky.

841
00:39:58,677 --> 00:40:00,478
And I still want
this deal to happen.

842
00:40:00,546 --> 00:40:01,913
Otherwise,
you'd be dead.

843
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:04,048
You try something like this
again, we're going to war,

844
00:40:04,116 --> 00:40:05,783
and that's the last
thing you want.

845
00:40:06,819 --> 00:40:08,219
Let me talk to my man.

846
00:40:08,287 --> 00:40:09,220
Fine.

847
00:40:09,288 --> 00:40:11,289
(breathing heavily)

848
00:40:13,459 --> 00:40:14,725
Yes?

849
00:40:14,793 --> 00:40:16,994
Bring him back here.

850
00:40:17,062 --> 00:40:18,729
Are you sure?

851
00:40:18,797 --> 00:40:20,398
Yeah.

852
00:40:24,303 --> 00:40:25,937
He wants to see you.

853
00:40:26,004 --> 00:40:27,705
Get up.

854
00:40:34,012 --> 00:40:35,913
Move to the driver's-side door.

855
00:40:35,981 --> 00:40:37,682
Slowly.

856
00:40:46,492 --> 00:40:48,192
Get in.

857
00:40:57,870 --> 00:40:59,036
I'm sorry, Oleg.

858
00:41:00,539 --> 00:41:02,106
(footsteps approaching)

859
00:41:02,174 --> 00:41:03,508
Leave us.

860
00:41:10,549 --> 00:41:12,650
I couldn't let him die.

861
00:41:12,718 --> 00:41:13,784
He's my brother.

862
00:41:13,852 --> 00:41:16,654
And he's my son.

863
00:41:16,722 --> 00:41:18,856
Do you think this
is any easier for me?

864
00:41:18,924 --> 00:41:20,992
It would've worked.

865
00:41:21,059 --> 00:41:22,727
The doctor was treating him.

866
00:41:22,794 --> 00:41:25,229
You disobeyed me, Josef.
You put this family

867
00:41:25,297 --> 00:41:26,497
at risk.

868
00:41:26,565 --> 00:41:28,466
<i>You put this family
at risk when you sent</i>

869
00:41:28,534 --> 00:41:30,501
those men into the clinic.
They killed

870
00:41:30,569 --> 00:41:31,903
three people!

871
00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:33,371
What do you think's
gonna happen when

872
00:41:33,438 --> 00:41:34,839
the police start
to investigate?!

873
00:41:36,108 --> 00:41:39,377
Who are you to question
my judgment?

874
00:41:39,444 --> 00:41:41,345
You are my first-born.

875
00:41:41,413 --> 00:41:43,080
You, of all people,
should give me respect.

876
00:41:43,148 --> 00:41:45,683
I do respect you.

877
00:41:45,751 --> 00:41:47,051
But this time you're wrong.

878
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:50,421
The doctor said that
Oleg could be treated.

879
00:41:50,489 --> 00:41:52,690
He showed me how!

880
00:41:52,758 --> 00:41:54,158
All we need is

881
00:41:54,226 --> 00:41:56,227
the medicine!

882
00:41:56,295 --> 00:41:58,563
There are rules, Josef.

883
00:41:58,630 --> 00:41:59,597
(grunts)

884
00:41:59,665 --> 00:42:01,098
They are simple rules.

885
00:42:01,166 --> 00:42:03,367
(Josef grunts)

886
00:42:03,435 --> 00:42:05,770
And they must never be broken!
Never endanger

887
00:42:05,837 --> 00:42:08,039
the family; never.

888
00:42:08,106 --> 00:42:09,874
And never disobey an order
from your father.

889
00:42:11,343 --> 00:42:12,944
Papa... (speaks Russian)

890
00:42:13,011 --> 00:42:15,213
JOSEF:
No, please,

891
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,347
No, please.

892
00:42:16,415 --> 00:42:18,316
You made me do this, Josef.

893
00:42:19,651 --> 00:42:21,252
Please. Please don't.

894
00:42:25,457 --> 00:42:26,824
I'm sorry, my son.

895
00:42:35,067 --> 00:42:36,567
Get up.

896
00:42:37,736 --> 00:42:39,403
Get up!

897
00:42:41,506 --> 00:42:43,541
Now, call Father Gregor.

898
00:42:43,609 --> 00:42:45,843
He'll pray over Oleg.

899
00:42:45,911 --> 00:42:49,480
When he's finished,
we'll bury your brother.

900
00:42:56,021 --> 00:42:57,922
Never disobey me again.

901
00:42:57,990 --> 00:43:01,325
