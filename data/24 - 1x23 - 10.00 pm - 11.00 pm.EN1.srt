00:00:13,253 --> 00:00:18,452
(Jack) Right now, terrorists are plotting
to assassinate a presidential candidate.

2
00:00:18,533 --> 00:00:21,252
My wife and daughter have been targeted.

3
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:25,485
And people that l work with
may be involved in both.

4
00:00:25,573 --> 00:00:30,966
l'm Federal Agent Jack Bauer,
and today is the longest day of my life.

5
00:00:33,653 --> 00:00:36,292
(Patty) You and Sherry
were childhood sweethearts?

6
00:00:36,373 --> 00:00:38,682
- That's right.
- There's never been anyone else?

7
00:00:38,773 --> 00:00:41,287
l'm running for president. l can't answer that.

8
00:00:41,373 --> 00:00:44,206
- Come on.
- Are you flirting with me, Patty?

9
00:00:44,293 --> 00:00:46,284
l don't know. l think l might be.

10
00:00:46,373 --> 00:00:48,887
- l did what you told me.
- And?

11
00:00:48,973 --> 00:00:53,364
l think it's working. But it's gonna
lead to other things, Mrs Palmer.

12
00:00:54,013 --> 00:00:58,131
- (Mason) Teri, l'm busy. Nina can talk to you.
- You are not gonna let my husband die!

13
00:00:58,213 --> 00:01:01,569
No one is gonna let Jack die.
We just can't go through with the trade.

14
00:01:01,653 --> 00:01:04,929
There's no difference.
Without your help he doesn't have a chance.

15
00:01:05,613 --> 00:01:10,084
l am willing to trade the life
ofJack Bauer for that ofmy son.

16
00:01:12,253 --> 00:01:15,882
OK, we're here. Here's Alexis. Where's Jack?

17
00:01:15,973 --> 00:01:17,884
Drop the weapon!

18
00:01:19,453 --> 00:01:22,206
You son of a bitch!

19
00:01:22,573 --> 00:01:26,361
lf your people deliver my brother
as promised, you'll live.

20
00:01:26,453 --> 00:01:30,844
- What about my daughter?
- You'll hear from us when this is over.

21
00:01:32,533 --> 00:01:34,524
(phone rings)

22
00:01:35,573 --> 00:01:36,369
Yeah!

23
00:01:36,453 --> 00:01:38,842
(Andre) South ofthe platform there's a car.

24
00:01:38,933 --> 00:01:44,929
lfyou want to see Kim alive, talk to no one,
get into it, and head toward Century City.

25
00:02:15,493 --> 00:02:17,484
(phone rings)

26
00:02:17,813 --> 00:02:18,563
Yeah.

27
00:02:18,653 --> 00:02:22,407
- (Andre) Proceed to Palmer's hotel.
- What do you want me to do?

28
00:02:22,493 --> 00:02:27,408
When your government abducted my father,
they also froze $200 million of our assets.

29
00:02:27,493 --> 00:02:30,485
Palmer has the necessary
clearance to unfreeze them.

30
00:02:30,573 --> 00:02:33,531
So everything that happened today
was because of money?

31
00:02:34,653 --> 00:02:38,407
l wouldn't say that. That money is ours.

32
00:02:38,493 --> 00:02:42,281
We'll call Palmer
at this number at exactly 10.45.

33
00:02:42,373 --> 00:02:47,493
Once l receive confirmation of the transfer,
l'll give you further instructions.

34
00:02:47,573 --> 00:02:49,962
What kind of instructions?

35
00:02:55,053 --> 00:02:58,887
- You want me to take out Palmer.
- Well, of course.

36
00:02:58,973 --> 00:03:01,567
That's why we let you go.

37
00:03:01,653 --> 00:03:04,451
That's why we have your daughter.

38
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:08,131
- Jack?
- l'm still here.

39
00:03:08,213 --> 00:03:11,922
Remember, we'll call at exactly 10.45.

40
00:03:12,013 --> 00:03:17,007
l trust l don't have to tell you what will
happen if Palmer doesn't answer.

41
00:03:34,133 --> 00:03:37,284
- Hello, Patty.
- You left the party early.

42
00:03:37,893 --> 00:03:40,532
l wasn't in the mood. What's up?

43
00:03:40,613 --> 00:03:44,765
l was just wondering if you had a chance
to look at the Dallas schedule.

44
00:03:44,853 --> 00:03:47,242
- lt's fine.
- Good.

45
00:03:49,253 --> 00:03:51,847
Um, do you need anything else from me?

46
00:04:01,933 --> 00:04:03,332
Sit down.

47
00:04:12,173 --> 00:04:17,327
A little while ago, we started down a road
that was gonna take us to a dangerous place.

48
00:04:17,413 --> 00:04:19,563
l know. And l'm sorry.

49
00:04:21,053 --> 00:04:22,532
Are you?

50
00:04:24,933 --> 00:04:26,332
Sorry?

51
00:04:28,053 --> 00:04:32,569
l'm attracted to you, Senator.
l always have been.

52
00:04:41,253 --> 00:04:44,245
Meet me in 20 minutes in room 907.

53
00:04:48,253 --> 00:04:50,244
l'll be waiting for you.

54
00:04:52,413 --> 00:04:53,448
(door opens)

55
00:04:53,533 --> 00:04:55,728
Oh, David, good. l...

56
00:04:56,693 --> 00:05:00,368
l, uh... need to talk to you for a second.

57
00:05:00,453 --> 00:05:04,924
- l'll just make those changes to the schedule.
- Thanks, Patty.

58
00:05:12,933 --> 00:05:16,687
l, uh... told Keith and Nicole

59
00:05:16,773 --> 00:05:21,005
that we're going to stump it separately
for the next couple of days.

60
00:05:21,093 --> 00:05:23,653
What did they say?

61
00:05:23,733 --> 00:05:28,443
- They know we're not getting along, David.
- Fine. What are they going to do?

62
00:05:28,533 --> 00:05:33,004
They'll stay with me.
Unless, of course, you want them with you.

63
00:05:35,693 --> 00:05:39,811
No. l could use a couple of days alone.

64
00:05:41,493 --> 00:05:43,085
Great.

65
00:06:06,373 --> 00:06:08,967
We gotta work under
a couple of assumptions here.

66
00:06:09,053 --> 00:06:12,409
The only way to find Jack is through Drazen.

67
00:06:12,493 --> 00:06:15,929
The only way to get to Drazen
is if Alexis takes us there.

68
00:06:16,013 --> 00:06:19,005
So we gotta devote all of
our resources to finding Alexis.

69
00:06:19,093 --> 00:06:21,163
- Yeah, but he shed the trackers.
- l know.

70
00:06:21,253 --> 00:06:25,007
So we use the satellite
and run computer simulators.

71
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:27,084
(phone rings)

72
00:06:30,253 --> 00:06:32,323
- Yeah?
- (Jack) George, it's me.

73
00:06:32,413 --> 00:06:34,483
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. Drazen let me go.

74
00:06:34,573 --> 00:06:37,167
- But l can't come in yet.
- What do you mean?

75
00:06:37,253 --> 00:06:40,484
George, listen. Tell Teri l'm out.
l know she's worried about me.

76
00:06:40,573 --> 00:06:44,327
lfDrazen calls, don't tell him that we talked.
lt'll put Kim in danger.

77
00:06:44,413 --> 00:06:48,201
- Fine. But, Jack, let us help you.
- George, l gotta go.

78
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:54,967
l don't like the sound of that.

79
00:06:55,053 --> 00:06:58,648
- What do you think he's doing?
- lf Drazen let him go for a reason...

80
00:06:59,413 --> 00:07:03,565
Jack won't let us help him,
he won't tell us what he's doing...

81
00:07:04,293 --> 00:07:07,729
Whatever he's doing,
he's trying to protect Kim.

82
00:07:09,413 --> 00:07:12,644
What's the one thing we know
for sure that Drazen wants?

83
00:07:12,733 --> 00:07:14,724
Palmer dead.

84
00:07:18,533 --> 00:07:23,732
Jane, connect me with the Palmer suite,
Secret Service.

85
00:07:52,813 --> 00:07:53,802
What's happening?

86
00:07:53,893 --> 00:07:58,045
- l can't stop the internal bleeding.
- Do not let him die!

87
00:08:04,213 --> 00:08:06,204
Father...

88
00:08:10,813 --> 00:08:12,610
Alexie!

89
00:08:13,413 --> 00:08:15,210
Do something!

90
00:08:27,053 --> 00:08:30,807
l'm sorry. There's nothing more l can do.

91
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:42,292
No. Leave us. We're family.

92
00:08:58,093 --> 00:09:00,288
First Mother and Martina...

93
00:09:03,093 --> 00:09:05,209
Now Alexis.

94
00:09:07,173 --> 00:09:10,449
- And it's Bauer!
- Andre, not yet! We still need her!

95
00:09:10,533 --> 00:09:13,411
- Call him. Let him hear her die!
- Andre!

96
00:09:42,573 --> 00:09:44,768
Uh, could you wait for me, please?

97
00:09:44,853 --> 00:09:46,445
Thanks.

98
00:09:49,893 --> 00:09:52,532
- Well?
- He wants to see me.

99
00:09:52,613 --> 00:09:54,251
- When?
- Tonight.

100
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:59,607
He didn't waste much time, huh?

101
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:03,608
How are you doing?

102
00:10:03,693 --> 00:10:09,325
- l told you, l feel really uncomfortable...
- No, no, Patty, please. Don't patronise me.

103
00:10:09,413 --> 00:10:14,043
You feel uncomfortable, but not because
you're ready to be with my husband.

104
00:10:14,693 --> 00:10:19,403
You feel uncomfortable because you're
doing it with my knowledge and consent.

105
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:23,292
Why are you doing this, Mrs Palmer?

106
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:28,970
lt's... lt's important for David's career
that l have his full confidence.

107
00:10:29,813 --> 00:10:32,202
And l no longer have that.

108
00:10:33,293 --> 00:10:35,887
And you want me to get it?

109
00:10:35,973 --> 00:10:38,441
Yes. And report back to me.

110
00:10:43,973 --> 00:10:47,886
- We both know what it's going to...?
- Yes. We do.

111
00:10:49,973 --> 00:10:53,648
- And you're OK with that?
- No, l never said l was OK with it.

112
00:10:53,733 --> 00:10:58,602
But l'm willing to accept it...
because it's necessary.

113
00:11:06,173 --> 00:11:08,641
Your elevator's waiting.

114
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:15,211
Just make sure that Palmer
has an extra layer of security.

115
00:11:15,293 --> 00:11:17,932
- lt's gonna be a little difficult...
- Yes, l know.

116
00:11:18,013 --> 00:11:19,685
Nina, got a minute?

117
00:11:19,773 --> 00:11:22,128
- Hold on.
- This is important.

118
00:11:22,213 --> 00:11:26,001
Paul, we're done. OK. What?

119
00:11:26,093 --> 00:11:30,052
The schematics to the detention facility
where they were holding Victor Drazen.

120
00:11:30,133 --> 00:11:32,522
They've been tampered with.

121
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:36,651
- Who has access to these archives?
- Division and District.

122
00:11:36,733 --> 00:11:39,645
Can you find out who's had access
to these in the last month?

123
00:11:39,733 --> 00:11:43,203
- Yeah.
- Well, do it. The sooner the better.

124
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:49,006
- You think this is a second dirty agent?
- Yeah.

125
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:55,767
What did Tony want?

126
00:11:55,853 --> 00:11:59,323
He was just telling me why it was
so hard to pick up a thread on Drazen.

127
00:11:59,413 --> 00:12:02,723
Listen, l need your help.
Teri Bauer's a basket case.

128
00:12:03,813 --> 00:12:07,726
- l don't know what you think l can do.
- You're good with her. You calm her down.

129
00:12:07,813 --> 00:12:11,567
Come on! l gotta deal with Chapelle,
DOD's still trying to pass the buck...

130
00:12:11,653 --> 00:12:13,450
All right.

131
00:12:13,533 --> 00:12:15,524
She's in the conference room.

132
00:12:15,613 --> 00:12:17,604
l know.

133
00:12:23,693 --> 00:12:28,130
- ls it over? Did they make the trade?
- Jack's safe. He's no longer a hostage.

134
00:12:28,213 --> 00:12:30,602
ls he on his way?

135
00:12:30,693 --> 00:12:33,366
- We don't know where he is.
- What?

136
00:12:33,453 --> 00:12:36,923
He called in to tell us he was OK,
but he didn't say anything else.

137
00:12:37,013 --> 00:12:40,528
- Why not?
- Drazen wants him to do something else.

138
00:12:40,613 --> 00:12:44,162
That doesn't make any sense.
Why would he do anything for that man?

139
00:12:44,573 --> 00:12:48,009
- l think it's to protect Kim.
- What are you talking about?

140
00:12:49,653 --> 00:12:51,689
Teri, the reason that Kim isn't back...

141
00:12:51,773 --> 00:12:54,241
- Oh, no, no, no.
- Just listen to me.

142
00:12:54,693 --> 00:12:58,049
We think that's where Jack is now.
He's trying to bring Kim back.

143
00:12:58,133 --> 00:13:01,921
He's not communicating with us...
to protect her.

144
00:13:08,133 --> 00:13:10,124
l'm sorry.

145
00:13:56,573 --> 00:14:00,043
The task we have given your father
is a simple one.

146
00:14:01,053 --> 00:14:03,044
And if he does it...

147
00:14:04,573 --> 00:14:06,564
will you let me go?

148
00:14:09,573 --> 00:14:11,564
We will see.

149
00:14:29,933 --> 00:14:33,812
- Jack, l just got your message.
- Senator, l need to see you right away.

150
00:14:33,893 --> 00:14:36,771
- Your office said you might be coming.
- l am coming there.

151
00:14:36,853 --> 00:14:40,050
- Why?
- l have a message from Victor Drazen.

152
00:14:40,133 --> 00:14:43,648
They also said that Drazen has your daughter,
and you could be a threat.

153
00:14:43,733 --> 00:14:48,443
They've added to my security. Secret Service
has been instructed not to let you near me.

154
00:14:48,533 --> 00:14:53,243
They do have my daughter, but l'm not
coming there to harm you in any way.

155
00:14:55,253 --> 00:14:58,609
- What does Drazen want you to do?
- He wants to speak to you at 10.45.

156
00:14:58,693 --> 00:15:01,127
lt's a scrambled phone
so that it can't be traced.

157
00:15:01,213 --> 00:15:04,649
- What does he want to talk about?
- Money. l'll explain when l get there.

158
00:15:04,733 --> 00:15:07,645
Just tell your people to let me through.

159
00:15:07,733 --> 00:15:11,043
Drazen's people, who are holding
your daughter hostage, want me dead.

160
00:15:11,133 --> 00:15:12,851
You're asking a lot, Jack.

161
00:15:12,933 --> 00:15:16,846
They had my wife and daughter today,
and l still managed to save your life.

162
00:15:16,933 --> 00:15:21,131
l'm not coming there to harm you in any way.
l give you my word, sir.

163
00:15:52,533 --> 00:15:53,966
Hi.

164
00:15:54,053 --> 00:15:56,089
Anyone see you come up?

165
00:15:56,173 --> 00:15:58,368
No, l was careful.

166
00:16:00,533 --> 00:16:02,728
Why don't you sit down?

167
00:16:10,213 --> 00:16:12,204
Well, how much time do we have?

168
00:16:15,813 --> 00:16:17,804
Don't worry about that.

169
00:16:21,133 --> 00:16:24,125
l have something l wanna tell you, Patty.

170
00:16:25,293 --> 00:16:26,692
Yes?

171
00:16:32,093 --> 00:16:34,084
You're fired.

172
00:16:36,253 --> 00:16:38,926
Pack up. Get out.

173
00:16:39,013 --> 00:16:42,767
And don't bother to ask me
or anyone else on my staff for a reference.

174
00:16:42,853 --> 00:16:45,526
Prospective employers
won't like what l have to say.

175
00:16:45,613 --> 00:16:49,083
- l don't understand.
- l know what you're doing.

176
00:16:49,173 --> 00:16:52,006
You're working with my wife against me.

177
00:16:52,093 --> 00:16:57,565
Senator, l'm sorry.
l didn't mean to deceive you like this.

178
00:16:57,653 --> 00:17:00,565
But your wife insisted
and l didn't know what to say.

179
00:17:00,653 --> 00:17:04,692
- ''No'' would have done it.
- l know, l know. l should have.

180
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:09,722
- lt's just that... she can be scary sometimes.
- So can l.

181
00:17:09,813 --> 00:17:14,728
Obviously l have made a terrible mistake in
judgment, and if there's anything l can do...

182
00:17:14,813 --> 00:17:17,805
l want you out of this hotel in 30 minutes.

183
00:17:38,053 --> 00:17:43,286
You gotta take a look at this. These six people
have accessed the detention-facility archives.

184
00:17:43,373 --> 00:17:47,764
The first five were just doing
scheduled backups. Here's the sixth.

185
00:17:49,053 --> 00:17:51,044
George?

186
00:17:53,973 --> 00:17:56,203
George is the mole?

187
00:17:56,293 --> 00:18:00,286
lt's possible. He accessed
that file four days ago.

188
00:18:00,373 --> 00:18:03,843
Why would he have done that
if he wasn't involved?

189
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:09,888
- You gotta call Chapelle.
- No, shut down his network access.

190
00:18:09,973 --> 00:18:12,692
You can't let anything go in or out.

191
00:18:12,773 --> 00:18:15,970
OK. l just gotta figure out
how l'm gonna do it.

192
00:18:33,053 --> 00:18:35,851
- Where were you?
- Downstairs.

193
00:18:36,933 --> 00:18:39,049
- Downstairs?
- Yeah.

194
00:18:39,853 --> 00:18:43,163
ln room 907... with Patty.

195
00:18:45,013 --> 00:18:46,685
What?

196
00:18:46,773 --> 00:18:51,449
Save your energy, Sherry.
No need to act surprised.

197
00:18:54,893 --> 00:18:56,884
l fired her.

198
00:19:03,133 --> 00:19:05,601
You know your problem, David?

199
00:19:07,933 --> 00:19:13,769
You think everyone's conspiring against you,
when in fact we're just trying to help.

200
00:19:14,693 --> 00:19:18,971
By putting another woman in my bed?
Do you realise how sick that is?

201
00:19:19,053 --> 00:19:25,208
Oh, come on. We chose a certain life,
and we chose that a long time ago.

202
00:19:25,293 --> 00:19:28,922
lt's not about a house in the suburbs
and PTA meetings.

203
00:19:29,013 --> 00:19:32,847
And whether you're willing to accept it or not,
we serve a higher purpose.

204
00:19:32,933 --> 00:19:37,131
You are not qualified
to talk about higher purposes.

205
00:19:37,213 --> 00:19:38,965
- Oh, l'm not?
- No, you're not.

206
00:19:42,053 --> 00:19:45,728
We are about to move into the White House.

207
00:19:47,133 --> 00:19:49,124
That's right. We.

208
00:19:49,653 --> 00:19:51,450
You and l.

209
00:19:51,533 --> 00:19:54,605
And all the issues, all the politics,

210
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:58,163
all the hard work
that's gonna help get us there...

211
00:19:58,973 --> 00:20:01,692
l'm as much a part of that as you.

212
00:20:01,773 --> 00:20:03,764
So don't even try to deny it.

213
00:20:04,573 --> 00:20:07,770
Please, Sherry... don't go there.

214
00:20:08,653 --> 00:20:12,771
l'm not begrudging a single thing, David.
l don't need the limelight.

215
00:20:12,853 --> 00:20:16,448
- You sent her to spy on me!
- That's right! And do you wanna know why?

216
00:20:16,533 --> 00:20:20,287
- Yes, l do.
- Because you need me to look out for you.

217
00:20:20,373 --> 00:20:25,208
And if you cut me out of your inner circle,
like you threatened earlier today, you will fail.

218
00:20:25,293 --> 00:20:27,682
ln every way.

219
00:20:27,773 --> 00:20:29,365
You need me, David.

220
00:20:29,453 --> 00:20:31,648
- (knock on door)
- What?

221
00:20:32,653 --> 00:20:36,123
- Jack Bauer just arrived, sir.
- l'll be out in a moment.

222
00:20:45,813 --> 00:20:47,804
We're not done here.

223
00:21:00,893 --> 00:21:02,884
- Jack.
- Senator.

224
00:21:04,253 --> 00:21:08,212
Convincing Secret Service to let you
come up to see me was difficult enough.

225
00:21:08,293 --> 00:21:11,603
- They won't let me out of their sight.
- That's fine. All that matters

226
00:21:11,693 --> 00:21:16,323
is that you talk to Victor Drazen when he
calls, listen to his demands and cooperate.

227
00:21:16,413 --> 00:21:18,529
How did they get your daughter?

228
00:21:18,613 --> 00:21:21,650
Senator, we don't have much time.
He could call any second.

229
00:21:21,733 --> 00:21:23,883
- OK, you said this was about money?
- Yes.

230
00:21:23,973 --> 00:21:26,533
$200 million of his was frozen
after he was abducted.

231
00:21:26,613 --> 00:21:27,932
- And?
- He wants it.

232
00:21:28,013 --> 00:21:33,610
He says you have the clearance to get it back.
He'll give you instructions when he calls.

233
00:21:33,693 --> 00:21:36,287
That's why he sent you?
To get me to release his funds?

234
00:21:36,373 --> 00:21:41,970
Once he has confirmation of the transfer,
he'll ask me to take action against you.

235
00:21:42,053 --> 00:21:44,089
- To kill me?
- Yes.

236
00:21:44,173 --> 00:21:49,452
Of course, l would never do you any harm.
He has my daughter. l'm trying to buy time.

237
00:21:50,053 --> 00:21:54,092
Jack, l don't have the authority to transfer
those funds, and Drazen knows that.

238
00:21:54,173 --> 00:21:58,246
- What do you mean?
- He knows our system. That money's gone.

239
00:21:58,333 --> 00:22:00,722
l don't think that's the reason he's calling.

240
00:22:00,813 --> 00:22:02,804
(phone rings)

241
00:22:03,613 --> 00:22:06,411
Senator, please, answer this phone.

242
00:22:20,613 --> 00:22:25,084
OK, Jack. l'll do what l can.
l'll tell him what he wants to hear.

243
00:22:25,173 --> 00:22:28,768
- l can't guarantee he'll buy it.
- Thank you.

244
00:22:30,693 --> 00:22:34,129
- This is David Palmer.
- Senator Palmer.

245
00:22:34,213 --> 00:22:38,092
lt must be nice being reunited
with your friend Jack Bauer.

246
00:22:38,173 --> 00:22:40,607
- What do you want?
- (electronic whine)

247
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:42,763
Drazen? Drazen?

248
00:22:42,853 --> 00:22:45,242
He knows you can't get the money. Senator...

249
00:22:46,773 --> 00:22:47,523
No!

250
00:22:51,093 --> 00:22:52,651
(static on phone)

251
00:23:11,733 --> 00:23:13,325
Are you all right, sir?

252
00:23:26,013 --> 00:23:29,130
A detonation of this magnitude
had to be military plastique.

253
00:23:29,213 --> 00:23:33,206
- Get a powder residue. We'll try and trace it.
- Yes, sir.

254
00:23:41,853 --> 00:23:44,492
- Where is he? David!
- Ma'am, this area's not...

255
00:23:44,573 --> 00:23:46,803
Let her through. lt's OK. Calm down.

256
00:23:47,093 --> 00:23:50,210
- Where's Keith and Nicole?
- At the party. Are you all right?

257
00:23:50,293 --> 00:23:51,965
- l'm fine.
- Oh, God.

258
00:23:52,053 --> 00:23:53,202
Senator.

259
00:23:53,293 --> 00:23:56,649
This is Jack Bauer from CTU,
the man who saved my life twice today.

260
00:23:56,733 --> 00:23:59,566
- Mrs Palmer.
- The man that put your life in danger?

261
00:23:59,653 --> 00:24:02,486
- Sherry, please!
- (radio) Status report on the senator?

262
00:24:02,573 --> 00:24:07,328
Don't answer that yet. Senator,
we need to talk about this. My daughter...

263
00:24:07,413 --> 00:24:09,608
Tell them you don't know yet.

264
00:24:09,693 --> 00:24:12,730
This is Ron.
We don't have a 20 on the senator yet.

265
00:24:12,813 --> 00:24:14,246
What's going on?

266
00:24:14,333 --> 00:24:18,645
The man that planned this explosion
needs to believe that it was a success.

267
00:24:18,733 --> 00:24:22,487
Wait a minute. You mean, you want
the world to think that David is dead?

268
00:24:22,573 --> 00:24:25,087
- Yes, ma'am.
- Absolutely not.

269
00:24:25,653 --> 00:24:27,848
David, what's this all about?

270
00:24:29,093 --> 00:24:32,244
His daughter is being held hostage.

271
00:24:32,333 --> 00:24:36,565
But we can't have people thinking
David was assassinated. lt's preposterous!

272
00:24:36,653 --> 00:24:40,726
- lf we don't, ma'am, my daughter will die.
- Then what do you suggest we do, Mr Bauer?

273
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:43,122
We keep the senator quarantined
for a few hours.

274
00:24:43,213 --> 00:24:46,285
We leak a story to the press
that he was killed in the explosion.

275
00:24:46,373 --> 00:24:50,651
- You've got to be kidding.
- l've never been more serious in my life.

276
00:24:58,613 --> 00:25:04,290
- No, it's not gonna happen. David, tell him.
- This is about the life of an innocent girl.

277
00:25:04,373 --> 00:25:08,571
David, we cannot keep playing games
with the public and expect to keep their trust.

278
00:25:08,653 --> 00:25:12,009
Senator, if we're gonna do this,
we need to do this now.

279
00:25:18,333 --> 00:25:22,565
Go downstairs. Bring the children up.
Talk to no one. l mean it.

280
00:25:24,533 --> 00:25:26,967
l need all the agents
that have seen the senator.

281
00:25:27,053 --> 00:25:29,647
- Who is your senior chief of staff?
- Mike Novick.

282
00:25:29,733 --> 00:25:31,803
Bring in Mr Novick as well.

283
00:25:31,893 --> 00:25:37,684
As soon as Mr Palmer's family gets here, no
one is to enter or exit this area. Understood?

284
00:25:39,173 --> 00:25:41,164
Now, Sherry!

285
00:25:45,333 --> 00:25:47,563
- l'm very sorry.
- Don't worry about it.

286
00:25:47,653 --> 00:25:50,645
- Are you sure this is gonna work?
- lt has to.

287
00:25:56,893 --> 00:25:59,726
Hey, Almeida. What's going on
with my network access?

288
00:25:59,813 --> 00:26:04,443
- What do you mean?
- l can't access archives or Palmer's itinerary.

289
00:26:04,533 --> 00:26:07,331
- l'll call lTS.
- l don't have time for that. Are you up?

290
00:26:07,413 --> 00:26:09,404
- Yeah, l think so.
- Let's see.

291
00:26:11,453 --> 00:26:12,806
Yeah, here it is.

292
00:26:12,893 --> 00:26:15,282
So Palmer's still going to Dallas tomorrow.

293
00:26:15,373 --> 00:26:18,331
Call Secret Service and find out
what time his plane leaves.

294
00:26:18,413 --> 00:26:21,564
- Division's got it covered. l don't think...
- Hey, real simple.

295
00:26:21,653 --> 00:26:25,646
Call Secret Service.
Find out what time his plane leaves.

296
00:26:26,373 --> 00:26:28,841
And get my network up and running.

297
00:26:35,213 --> 00:26:37,204
(phone rings)

298
00:26:38,693 --> 00:26:41,412
- What happened?
- Well, he found out he's cut off.

299
00:26:41,493 --> 00:26:45,566
And he seems overly interested in
what happens to Palmer after he leaves LA.

300
00:26:45,653 --> 00:26:49,646
- We should alert Chapelle.
- No, not yet.

301
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:52,805
lf we go to Chapelle without evidence,
he'll slice us up.

302
00:26:52,893 --> 00:26:56,602
- What about his access?
- l'm gonna have to restore it.

303
00:26:56,693 --> 00:26:59,730
All right, but monitor everything
and send it to me.

304
00:27:00,333 --> 00:27:02,210
Put it up on all the monitors!

305
00:27:02,293 --> 00:27:04,488
Everybody, eyes on monitors.

306
00:27:06,053 --> 00:27:10,205
(TV) Events are unfolding by the minute
in this tragic and stunning development.

307
00:27:10,293 --> 00:27:15,606
The hotel has been sealed off. Only a limited
number ofpersonnel are allowed inside.

308
00:27:15,693 --> 00:27:18,526
We have heard from a spokesperson
from the Palmer camp,

309
00:27:18,613 --> 00:27:23,482
who hasjust confirmed that Senator David
Palmer has been killed in an explosion.

310
00:27:23,573 --> 00:27:27,486
There is speculation this is related
to this morning's assassination attempt,

311
00:27:27,573 --> 00:27:30,690
but at this time no one has been arrested.

312
00:27:32,413 --> 00:27:35,052
We did it, father. We did it.

313
00:27:35,133 --> 00:27:37,328
Ah, yes.

314
00:27:37,413 --> 00:27:40,689
All right. l'll take care of the girl,
then we can leave.

315
00:27:40,773 --> 00:27:45,972
Do not do anything until we know
that Jack Bauer is dead. Do nothing.

316
00:27:58,773 --> 00:28:00,729
(phone rings)

317
00:28:00,813 --> 00:28:03,691
Sir, we just contacted Mike Novick.
He's on his way.

318
00:28:03,773 --> 00:28:05,968
Agent Bauer, it's for you.

319
00:28:06,493 --> 00:28:08,085
Thank you.

320
00:28:09,373 --> 00:28:13,366
- Yeah?
- (Andre) You're a very lucky man, Mr Bauer.

321
00:28:14,813 --> 00:28:18,044
l was calling to confirm your death,
but l see you've survived.

322
00:28:18,133 --> 00:28:20,249
Andre.

323
00:28:20,333 --> 00:28:22,324
l have an offer to make you.

324
00:28:22,413 --> 00:28:25,723
You've killed Senator Palmer.
l'm the last person on your list.

325
00:28:25,813 --> 00:28:28,407
l'll make you a trade: me for my daughter.

326
00:28:30,973 --> 00:28:34,045
Come to Port of Los Angeles. Dock 11A.

327
00:28:34,133 --> 00:28:37,205
What assurances do l have
that you'll let her go when l arrive?

328
00:28:37,293 --> 00:28:43,482
Sadly, none. But we've decided the sins
of the father need not be visited upon her.

329
00:28:44,453 --> 00:28:47,365
Port of Los Angeles. Dock 11A.
l'll be there in 30 minutes.

330
00:28:47,453 --> 00:28:53,483
And, Jack, if you bring your colleagues
or involve them in any way, we'll know.

331
00:28:54,293 --> 00:28:56,284
l understand.

332
00:28:58,253 --> 00:29:00,244
l have to go alone.

333
00:29:00,333 --> 00:29:02,801
- Good luck.
- Thank you, sir.

334
00:29:10,133 --> 00:29:12,408
Why are you doing this to us?

335
00:29:19,093 --> 00:29:23,006
Yeah, Jack, l can tell him,
but you should really let us help you on this.

336
00:29:23,093 --> 00:29:24,606
No, l can't, notyet.

337
00:29:24,693 --> 00:29:27,207
Give us a general position,
so we can be nearby.

338
00:29:27,293 --> 00:29:33,243
No. lfDrazen's got someone else working
on the inside, it could put Kim in danger.

339
00:29:33,333 --> 00:29:34,368
All right.

340
00:29:34,453 --> 00:29:36,921
- Let me speak to Teri.
- OK.

341
00:29:41,493 --> 00:29:43,643
lt's Jack.

342
00:29:43,733 --> 00:29:45,530
- Jack?
- How are you holdin' up?

343
00:29:45,613 --> 00:29:50,323
- Where are you? Do you know about Kim?
- Yes. l'm on my way to pick her up. She's fine.

344
00:29:50,413 --> 00:29:52,768
- Where is she?
- l can't say now, sweetheart.

345
00:29:52,853 --> 00:29:55,526
But l promise you,
soon she's going to be with you.

346
00:29:55,613 --> 00:29:59,288
Thank God. What do you mean ''she''?
What about you?

347
00:29:59,853 --> 00:30:03,289
- l'm sorry. l meant to say both of us.
- Oh, good.

348
00:30:03,813 --> 00:30:08,409
l just don't think l can take much more of this.
l need you both here, Jack.

349
00:30:08,493 --> 00:30:12,372
l know, sweetheart. Look, it's almost over.
Just hang in there, OK?

350
00:30:12,453 --> 00:30:14,250
OK.

351
00:30:14,733 --> 00:30:16,724
- Teri?
- What?

352
00:30:20,733 --> 00:30:23,531
- l love you.
- l love you too, Jack.

353
00:30:26,053 --> 00:30:27,771
Honey, um...

354
00:30:28,893 --> 00:30:31,646
There's something l have to tell you.

355
00:30:31,733 --> 00:30:35,328
- l've been waiting for the right time.
- What is it?

356
00:30:37,133 --> 00:30:39,328
You're gonna be a father.

357
00:30:39,413 --> 00:30:41,210
Again.

358
00:30:41,693 --> 00:30:44,730
What are you saying, that you're pregnant?

359
00:30:44,813 --> 00:30:48,203
Well, yes, that's generally how it works, Jack.

360
00:30:50,293 --> 00:30:52,488
- Jack?
- l'm still here.

361
00:30:54,693 --> 00:30:58,652
l'm sorry, it was the last thing
l thought you were gonna say.

362
00:30:58,733 --> 00:31:01,531
Are you all right with this?
Are you happy about this?

363
00:31:01,613 --> 00:31:03,808
Oh, yes. l am.

364
00:31:06,173 --> 00:31:11,930
l keep thinking that... maybe it's the
second chance we've been talking about.

365
00:31:14,733 --> 00:31:16,724
Are you there?

366
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:21,683
- Yeah, l'm still here.
- Are you happy about it?

367
00:31:22,413 --> 00:31:25,485
Yes. Yes, l'm happy about it.

368
00:31:25,573 --> 00:31:27,609
l'm very, very happy.

369
00:31:29,893 --> 00:31:33,363
Good. Are you sure everything's OK?

370
00:31:35,053 --> 00:31:37,123
Yeah.

371
00:31:37,213 --> 00:31:41,411
Sweetheart... l promise you
everything is gonna be OK.

372
00:31:42,453 --> 00:31:46,844
lt's just been a really, really long day.

373
00:31:49,933 --> 00:31:53,482
Just get on back here
so we can all go home, OK?

374
00:31:53,573 --> 00:31:55,370
OK.

375
00:31:55,893 --> 00:31:58,885
Teri... l love you so much.

376
00:32:01,533 --> 00:32:05,526
l love you too, Jack. l'll see you soon.

377
00:32:46,733 --> 00:32:48,724
l had a sister once.

378
00:32:50,253 --> 00:32:53,643
She was full of life... like you.

379
00:32:55,733 --> 00:32:58,725
She was a photographer
and took hundreds of pictures.

380
00:32:58,813 --> 00:33:00,804
l used to love looking at them.

381
00:33:02,853 --> 00:33:04,844
Now l can't do that any more.

382
00:33:08,133 --> 00:33:10,886
You know how she died?

383
00:33:10,973 --> 00:33:12,964
Has anyone told you?

384
00:33:15,053 --> 00:33:17,692
Your father killed her.

385
00:33:17,773 --> 00:33:21,448
- My father would never kill innocent people.
- You wanted to know.

386
00:33:21,533 --> 00:33:25,162
- l don't believe you.
- Oh, he says it was an accident.

387
00:33:26,973 --> 00:33:30,648
But when a man goes
halfway round the world to set off a bomb,

388
00:33:30,733 --> 00:33:34,692
he's responsible for
any ''accidents'' that result.

389
00:33:39,133 --> 00:33:41,931
Has your father ever talked about his work?

390
00:33:43,693 --> 00:33:48,403
About where he goes...
on those long trips overseas?

391
00:33:51,773 --> 00:33:54,128
Of course not.

392
00:33:54,213 --> 00:33:56,852
- He can't.
- Because he's a criminal.

393
00:33:56,933 --> 00:33:58,924
My father is a good man.

394
00:34:02,933 --> 00:34:04,924
No.

395
00:34:06,213 --> 00:34:08,204
He's not.

396
00:34:37,293 --> 00:34:42,890
Palmer's still alive. The suite at his hotel
blew up, but apparently he got out unscathed.

397
00:34:45,293 --> 00:34:47,602
- Why the reports?
- l haven't been debriefed,

398
00:34:47,693 --> 00:34:50,605
but l guess it makes sense
as a defensive strategy.

399
00:34:50,693 --> 00:34:53,730
Palmer's safe as long as
the hitters think he's dead.

400
00:34:53,813 --> 00:34:58,603
This goes no further than the three of us until
the public's made aware that he survived.

401
00:34:58,693 --> 00:35:01,048
- What about the perpetrators?
- lt's unclear.

402
00:35:01,133 --> 00:35:04,409
Our intel is being refreshed
by Secret Service as we speak.

403
00:35:04,493 --> 00:35:08,850
So, stay at your stations. Start rebuilding
profiles based on the incoming information

404
00:35:08,933 --> 00:35:11,527
and we'll have a new plan
in place within the hour.

405
00:35:11,613 --> 00:35:14,446
Have you spoken to Jack
since the first time he called?

406
00:35:14,533 --> 00:35:16,330
Not me.

407
00:35:16,413 --> 00:35:19,610
lt doesn't matter.
This'll all be over soon anyway.

408
00:35:30,573 --> 00:35:35,283
- Have you talked to Jack?
- Yeah, he called, but he won't let us help him.

409
00:35:49,373 --> 00:35:52,763
lt's kind of cold.
Do you mind if l have some coffee?

410
00:36:10,253 --> 00:36:12,687
Aaargh!

411
00:36:23,253 --> 00:36:25,244
(shouting in Serbian)

412
00:36:39,853 --> 00:36:41,411
(speaks Serbian)

413
00:37:35,093 --> 00:37:38,165
(Andre) Stop right there, Kim! Don't move!

414
00:37:42,373 --> 00:37:44,568
Don't be foolish! You'll drown!

415
00:37:54,293 --> 00:37:56,409
(speaks Serbian)

416
00:38:16,573 --> 00:38:17,847
(door opens)

417
00:38:18,293 --> 00:38:22,764
Hey. Have you talked to anyone else
besides me since Jack called?

418
00:38:22,853 --> 00:38:25,128
No. Why?

419
00:38:25,413 --> 00:38:28,689
lt's... nothing. l'm sorry. Are you OK?

420
00:38:28,933 --> 00:38:31,242
- Yeah. Everything's fine.
- Good.

421
00:38:31,933 --> 00:38:33,764
Nina...

422
00:38:34,693 --> 00:38:39,323
The past is the past, and until today
you were mostly a voice on the phone for me.

423
00:38:39,413 --> 00:38:43,042
But l want you to know
that l have nothing but respect for you.

424
00:38:44,013 --> 00:38:46,129
Thank you.

425
00:38:46,213 --> 00:38:51,571
And l think... all three of us owe you our lives.

426
00:38:53,653 --> 00:38:57,532
Well, that's a bit of an overstatement, but...

427
00:38:57,613 --> 00:39:00,366
Actually, no, it's kind of an understatement.

428
00:39:02,573 --> 00:39:05,167
There's something else l want to tell you.

429
00:39:09,373 --> 00:39:11,364
l'm pregnant.

430
00:39:13,213 --> 00:39:15,204
You are?

431
00:39:18,253 --> 00:39:20,483
Well, that's... that's wonderful.

432
00:39:20,573 --> 00:39:22,484
Yeah, it is.

433
00:39:23,253 --> 00:39:25,244
That's great.

434
00:39:27,493 --> 00:39:29,484
lt's great.

435
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:33,087
- Well, l...
- Sure. Go ahead.

436
00:40:46,373 --> 00:40:48,933
How are we going to do this without the girl?

437
00:40:49,013 --> 00:40:51,402
Bauer has no choice but to trust us.

438
00:40:52,853 --> 00:40:54,844
(phone rings)

439
00:40:57,533 --> 00:40:59,444
(in Serbian)

440
00:41:25,533 --> 00:41:29,526
Oh, there you are.
We just got some new intel from Langley.

441
00:41:29,613 --> 00:41:32,002
- Oh, good.
- Yeah, take a look at this.
