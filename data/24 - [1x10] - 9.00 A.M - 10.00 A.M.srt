1
00:00:14,236 --> 00:00:19,028
There are terrorists planning
to assassinate a presidential candidate.

2
00:00:19,116 --> 00:00:22,152
My wife and daughter have been kidnapped.

3
00:00:22,244 --> 00:00:26,372
And the people that I work with
may be involved in both.

4
00:00:26,457 --> 00:00:28,782
I'm Federal Agent Jack Bauer.

5
00:00:28,876 --> 00:00:31,663
This is the longest day of my life.

6
00:02:00,007 --> 00:02:02,316
This is Dave Thompson.

7
00:02:02,407 --> 00:02:05,206
It's 9 o'clock on primary day
in Southern California

8
00:02:05,287 --> 00:02:07,722
and the freeways are looking pretty good.

9
00:02:07,808 --> 00:02:12,280
Usual delays in the Sepulveda Pass
southbound, but it loosens up at Culver.

10
00:02:12,369 --> 00:02:15,679
We'll have a complete report
in six minutes. Back to you, Bill.

11
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:19,763
Thanks, Dave. In the news, we haven't
learned any more about the incident

12
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:24,287
at the San Clarita power plant where
Senator Palmer was rushed out this morning,

13
00:02:24,371 --> 00:02:26,487
but we're told the senator was unharmed.

14
00:02:26,571 --> 00:02:30,406
But Secret Service and the FBl
haven't released any new information.

15
00:02:30,491 --> 00:02:33,484
- Get the drip.
- I'm on it.

16
00:02:34,492 --> 00:02:37,087
Find me a pulse.

17
00:02:39,293 --> 00:02:42,331
I've got a pulse. 140 over 30.

18
00:02:43,775 --> 00:02:45,652
Pupils not reactive.

19
00:02:45,734 --> 00:02:48,044
Respiration shallow. 48.

20
00:02:48,975 --> 00:02:51,773
Let's start two large-bore IVs, bilateral.

21
00:02:54,536 --> 00:02:57,255
She's lost a lot of blood.

22
00:02:57,337 --> 00:03:01,967
- We should start the other line.
- All right.

23
00:03:03,697 --> 00:03:05,688
Is it in?

24
00:03:08,059 --> 00:03:11,449
Ready? One, two, three.

25
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:21,291
Ready?

26
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:23,292
Lift.

27
00:03:39,944 --> 00:03:41,935
Excuse me.

28
00:03:44,864 --> 00:03:47,379
I've got the door.

29
00:03:53,226 --> 00:03:58,938
Everyone, I'm sorry to tell you Jamey Farrell
tried to commit suicide a few minutes ago.

30
00:03:59,027 --> 00:04:01,143
Fortunately, she's still alive,

31
00:04:01,227 --> 00:04:05,380
and they're doing everything they can
to keep her that way.

32
00:04:06,308 --> 00:04:10,097
I know it won't be easy to put this out
of our minds, but we don't have a choice.

33
00:04:10,189 --> 00:04:12,624
We still believe that Palmer's life is in danger,

34
00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:15,508
which means we all have
to get back to work now.

35
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:22,144
- You wanna look at this?
- Not now. Call Jamey's mom.

36
00:04:22,231 --> 00:04:25,269
Explain what happened.
Have her pick up Kyle.

37
00:04:40,554 --> 00:04:43,023
- CTU, Myers.
- Hey, it's me. Hold on.

38
00:04:44,275 --> 00:04:46,311
- OK.
- Did you get the car?

39
00:04:46,395 --> 00:04:48,785
Yes, and I got the care package too. Thanks.

40
00:04:48,876 --> 00:04:50,594
- Jack, Teri called.
- What?

41
00:04:50,676 --> 00:04:53,510
- About 20 minutes ago.
- Where is she? What did she say?

42
00:04:53,596 --> 00:04:56,873
I don't know. She barely said her name
before she got disconnected.

43
00:04:56,957 --> 00:04:57,992
What happened?

44
00:04:58,077 --> 00:05:01,991
She didn't call back, and when I tried
to redial, the number was blocked.

45
00:05:02,077 --> 00:05:05,514
- She sounded all right.
- The police have thrown a net over this area.

46
00:05:05,599 --> 00:05:08,237
There's no way I can help Teri
until I get through it.

47
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:11,949
Maybe you should turn yourself in,
tell your side of the story.

48
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:15,919
No. Gaines will keep Teri and Kim alive
as long as he thinks I can be useful to him.

49
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,514
In custody I won't be.
Scan the police frequencies.

50
00:05:18,601 --> 00:05:22,071
- See if you can locate any of the roadblocks.
- All right.

51
00:05:23,842 --> 00:05:25,833
Just a minute.

52
00:05:27,843 --> 00:05:30,436
- OK.
- Jamey give you anything else?

53
00:05:30,523 --> 00:05:31,876
Jack...

54
00:05:31,963 --> 00:05:34,272
Jamey tried to kill herself.

55
00:05:35,323 --> 00:05:38,122
Jack? Did you hear me?

56
00:05:40,244 --> 00:05:43,840
- Jack?
- Yeah. You said she tried?

57
00:05:43,925 --> 00:05:47,123
We sent her to County,
but it doesn't look good.

58
00:05:47,205 --> 00:05:51,324
- Are you sure it was a suicide attempt?
- Yeah. She slit her wrists.

59
00:05:52,247 --> 00:05:54,999
- Where is her son Kyle?
- He didn't see anything.

60
00:05:55,087 --> 00:05:58,397
We've already called Jamey's mom.
She's on her way to pick him up.

61
00:05:58,487 --> 00:06:02,037
OK. Send someone down to County
to question Jamey in case she makes it.

62
00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:05,325
- She's still our best source of information.
- OK.

63
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:11,166
- Dammit.
- What? What's wrong?

64
00:06:11,249 --> 00:06:15,129
They set up a roadblock at Montana.
Nina, I could have used a heads-up here.

65
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:19,329
I'm sorry. They must have set it up
before I started scanning.

66
00:06:20,771 --> 00:06:24,650
- Find me another route.
- Give me a second to pull up LA traffic.

67
00:06:25,892 --> 00:06:29,363
OK. You go to the window.
You let me know if somebody comes.

68
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:49,294
- Tony. Line three. Can you get it?
- Almeida.

69
00:06:49,736 --> 00:06:53,446
OK. It looks like roadblocks
aren't your only problem.

70
00:06:54,217 --> 00:06:58,176
They sent a description of you
to all the units in the area.

71
00:06:58,258 --> 00:07:00,818
Nina. It's Teri Bauer.

72
00:07:01,578 --> 00:07:04,172
Jack, hold on a minute.

73
00:07:05,859 --> 00:07:07,532
- Teri.
- Nina. Thank God.

74
00:07:07,619 --> 00:07:10,338
- Where are you?
- I don't know, but I got a hold of a phone.

75
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:12,854
OK. Is Kim with you? Are you all right?

76
00:07:12,941 --> 00:07:15,501
I'm fine. Kimberly's fine.
You know where Jack is?

77
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:18,300
Listen, I'm gonna connect you
with him right now.

78
00:07:18,381 --> 00:07:21,772
Leave the line open as long as you can
so we can do a trace. Understand?

79
00:07:21,862 --> 00:07:24,854
- Yeah.
- Have Milo set up the trace on line three.

80
00:07:27,063 --> 00:07:29,657
- Jack, I've got Teri.
- Patch her through.

81
00:07:30,103 --> 00:07:31,935
Mom, someone's coming.

82
00:07:32,343 --> 00:07:35,461
- He's here.
- Teri? Teri?

83
00:07:39,385 --> 00:07:42,218
What do you want from us?

84
00:07:44,425 --> 00:07:47,418
I think I left my phone in here.
Have you seen it?

85
00:07:47,506 --> 00:07:49,576
No, I haven't.

86
00:07:49,667 --> 00:07:51,783
Jack, I've muted our conversation.

87
00:07:51,867 --> 00:07:55,099
- Have you set up a trace?
- Yeah. I told Teri to leave the line open.

88
00:07:55,188 --> 00:07:58,463
Good. Keep our side muted.
I don't wanna give away this phone.

89
00:08:02,269 --> 00:08:05,147
You better not be lyin', bitch.

90
00:08:21,232 --> 00:08:23,348
Bitch.

91
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:44,032
They moved everything around in here!
Dammit! Rick, you seen it anywheres?

92
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:49,268
No. No.

93
00:08:57,998 --> 00:08:59,990
Got anything on that trace?

94
00:09:00,079 --> 00:09:04,118
Latitude is north of the 10. I should have
a rough longitude in a couple of minutes,

95
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:08,079
though triangulating
the longitude is gonna be trickier.

96
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,350
This is Dave Thompson.

97
00:09:11,441 --> 00:09:16,151
We're seeing congestion in North Hollywood
around the Grant Street Elementary School.

98
00:09:16,241 --> 00:09:18,836
Senator Palmer is due
to make an appearance there

99
00:09:18,921 --> 00:09:23,951
and quite a few supporters and media are
hoping to catch a glimpse of the candidate

100
00:09:24,043 --> 00:09:28,082
who is not letting this morning's incident
interfere with his schedule today.

101
00:09:28,163 --> 00:09:32,874
I don't understand the rationale
behind it. No, listen to me. Why?

102
00:09:32,964 --> 00:09:35,876
Why defend something
that you don't need to defend?

103
00:09:35,965 --> 00:09:38,160
Maureen won't come out with the story today.

104
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:40,395
- She will.
- We don't know that.

105
00:09:40,485 --> 00:09:43,159
Look, if not now, tomorrow.

106
00:09:43,246 --> 00:09:46,761
If not her, someone else.
Our son is accused of murder.

107
00:09:46,847 --> 00:09:49,077
- The story's too big to hide.
- Mike.

108
00:09:49,167 --> 00:09:53,286
He's right, Sherry. We need to control
when and how this story comes out.

109
00:09:53,367 --> 00:09:56,883
One hour ago someone tried
to kill my husband.

110
00:09:56,968 --> 00:09:59,563
That bought us time and we should use it.

111
00:09:59,648 --> 00:10:05,043
The assassination attempt might even work
for us if we break the story about Keith.

112
00:10:05,129 --> 00:10:08,759
It might put the public
in a more forgiving frame of mind.

113
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:10,886
- You're making a mistake.
- It's mine to make.

114
00:10:10,971 --> 00:10:14,486
No, it isn't, David,
because you didn't get here by yourself.

115
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:17,291
Do not go against me on this, Sherry.

116
00:10:17,371 --> 00:10:19,887
Promise me.

117
00:10:19,972 --> 00:10:22,043
I can't promise you anything.

118
00:10:47,457 --> 00:10:52,247
Jack, we've got a preliminary read
on the trace. It's a pretty big area.

119
00:10:52,337 --> 00:10:55,808
- I'm listening.
- It's north of the 10, east of the 405.

120
00:10:59,099 --> 00:11:01,693
Did you hear me?

121
00:11:02,739 --> 00:11:05,015
Jack?

122
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:08,615
Well, that's a start.
Now get me through these cops.

123
00:11:10,221 --> 00:11:14,738
Your best bet is east on Thurston.
But I don't think you should be moving yet.

124
00:11:14,821 --> 00:11:20,818
I'll get through the net somehow. Just stay on
that trace and help me find my family, please.

125
00:11:26,704 --> 00:11:29,901
Tony, open an extra socket for me on one.

126
00:11:34,345 --> 00:11:37,701
- Did you hear me?
- Come here. You gotta check this out.

127
00:11:47,027 --> 00:11:50,224
- What is it?
- I checked Jamey's disk for recent emails.

128
00:11:50,308 --> 00:11:54,096
She was pretty careful, but she must
not have had time to get rid of this one.

129
00:11:54,188 --> 00:11:57,704
- That's from this morning.
- Mm-hm. To an anonymous recipient.

130
00:11:57,789 --> 00:12:02,499
- What about the encryption?
- I'll get Milo on it. You can see the subject.

131
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:05,388
Ted Cofell? Coffell? Find out who he is.

132
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:13,427
I'm busy.

133
00:12:20,513 --> 00:12:21,309
Yeah.

134
00:12:21,393 --> 00:12:24,305
- I need you to do something.
- I'm working on this trace.

135
00:12:24,393 --> 00:12:28,785
You're gonna have to do two things at once.
I need this email decrypted.

136
00:12:34,555 --> 00:12:36,546
CTU, Almeida.

137
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:44,628
OK.

138
00:12:45,357 --> 00:12:47,348
Thanks.

139
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,190
Nina.

140
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:04,751
That was the clinic. Jamey didn't make it.

141
00:13:32,325 --> 00:13:36,034
- Mom, it's clear. They're gone.
- Hello, Jack? Are you there?

142
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:38,401
- Teri? It's Nina. Are you OK to talk?
- Uh-huh.

143
00:13:38,486 --> 00:13:42,321
I'll put you through to Jack.
Jack, I've got Teri.

144
00:13:42,407 --> 00:13:44,682
- Teri?
- Jack. Can you talk? Where are you?

145
00:13:44,767 --> 00:13:47,759
- I'm on my way to get you out. Are you OK?
- I'm hangin' in there.

146
00:13:47,848 --> 00:13:51,683
Good. Thank God. Nina's tracing
the cellular signal to your location.

147
00:13:51,768 --> 00:13:54,727
- How long will that take to find it?
- Nina?

148
00:13:55,529 --> 00:13:58,646
20 minutes. Milo's narrowed
the signal to four antennas,

149
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:02,086
which is still about 500 square miles.

150
00:14:02,171 --> 00:14:05,207
- God.
- Don't worry. We're closing in on it.

151
00:14:09,051 --> 00:14:11,201
Will you please pull over to the kerb?

152
00:14:11,292 --> 00:14:13,681
- Jack?
- No, I'm still here, honey.

153
00:14:13,772 --> 00:14:16,684
Is there anything you can tell us
that might help us find you?

154
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:19,810
I know we're at least
a few miles out of the city.

155
00:14:19,893 --> 00:14:23,852
Look, this is gonna take me
about a minute, OK? Hold on.

156
00:15:53,349 --> 00:15:55,545
11-8-19. Code 6 North.

157
00:15:55,629 --> 00:15:58,781
11-8-9. I'm Code 6 South, heading your way.

158
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:00,861
Copy.

159
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:17,663
11-8-19. North sector. Nothing so far.

160
00:16:19,754 --> 00:16:22,348
Jack, are you all right?

161
00:16:28,315 --> 00:16:29,464
Jack?

162
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:31,944
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

163
00:16:32,036 --> 00:16:36,315
Honey, it'd really help if you could tell us
everything you know about where you are.

164
00:16:36,396 --> 00:16:39,150
I don't know. They blindfolded me
when they picked me up.

165
00:16:39,237 --> 00:16:42,116
- Where was that?
- Mulholland, near Coldwater.

166
00:16:42,197 --> 00:16:45,156
How long did it take to get from there
to where you are now?

167
00:16:45,238 --> 00:16:47,673
I'm not sure. Half an hour?

168
00:16:47,758 --> 00:16:50,034
- Streets or freeways?
- Freeways, I think.

169
00:16:50,119 --> 00:16:52,189
- Milo.
- Already on it.

170
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:55,157
Anything else? Any sounds or smells?

171
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:59,359
- Can you hear cars or airplanes? Anything?
- No, it's pretty quiet.

172
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,751
There's hills and, um, some eucalyptus trees.

173
00:17:03,521 --> 00:17:07,674
It may be in the north valley,
somewhere inland. It's pretty remote.

174
00:17:07,762 --> 00:17:13,554
That helps. All right, I got it narrowed down
to three sectors, but check it out.

175
00:17:13,643 --> 00:17:16,953
OK, the closer we get,
the longer each iteration's gonna take.

176
00:17:17,043 --> 00:17:19,399
What does that mean?

177
00:17:19,484 --> 00:17:21,554
It's just techno talk, Teri.

178
00:17:21,644 --> 00:17:24,398
Don't worry. We're making good progress.

179
00:17:30,366 --> 00:17:32,516
Jack? Are you there?

180
00:17:33,766 --> 00:17:36,361
Yeah, baby. I'm still here.

181
00:17:38,207 --> 00:17:41,165
Teri, I'm gonna find you. I promise.

182
00:17:43,088 --> 00:17:45,205
I know you will.

183
00:17:45,928 --> 00:17:50,719
Nina's tracing the call right now. We'll have
your location in just a couple of minutes,

184
00:17:50,809 --> 00:17:56,123
but it's really important you don't hang up,
OK? Even if you can't talk, don't hang up.

185
00:17:59,331 --> 00:18:02,129
Sweetheart, are you sure you're all right?

186
00:18:03,531 --> 00:18:06,365
They didn't hurt you, did they?

187
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:09,171
I'm fine. So's Kim.

188
00:18:10,252 --> 00:18:13,245
- Is she there with you?
- Yeah, she's right here.

189
00:18:15,613 --> 00:18:17,843
Put her on the phone so both of you can hear.

190
00:18:17,934 --> 00:18:19,925
OK.

191
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:27,006
- Dad?
- Hey, sweetheart.

192
00:18:28,055 --> 00:18:29,535
Are you OK?

193
00:18:29,616 --> 00:18:33,053
Yeah. Who are these guys?
Why are they doing this?

194
00:18:33,136 --> 00:18:35,367
I don't know, honey, but I'm gonna find out.

195
00:18:35,456 --> 00:18:40,054
But right now I just wanna make sure
that you and Mommy get home safely, OK?

196
00:18:40,137 --> 00:18:42,891
Honey...

197
00:18:42,978 --> 00:18:47,848
Look, uh... I know I haven't always been there
for you when you've needed me and...

198
00:18:47,938 --> 00:18:52,057
- Jack, you don't have to do this.
- I want both of you to know that...

199
00:18:52,739 --> 00:18:56,654
I'm here for you now. I love you more
than anything in the whole world,

200
00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:00,177
and I promise you I am gonna
get you both out of there. OK?

201
00:19:02,061 --> 00:19:04,894
So no matter what happens, don't give up.

202
00:19:04,982 --> 00:19:09,100
We're a family. We're gonna
get through this like a family.

203
00:19:09,742 --> 00:19:10,936
OK?

204
00:19:12,423 --> 00:19:15,416
So don't forget I'm coming to get you.

205
00:19:21,105 --> 00:19:23,380
Sweetheart?

206
00:19:23,465 --> 00:19:26,263
Stay on the phone. I'm gonna be right back.

207
00:19:55,271 --> 00:19:57,387
- You still there?
- Mom, he's coming back.

208
00:19:57,471 --> 00:20:02,307
- Jack, I have to go. He's coming back.
- Who's coming? Teri, keep the line open.

209
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:05,101
It's just a phone!

210
00:20:05,192 --> 00:20:07,786
It's how Gaines gets a hold of me
when he needs me.

211
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:10,467
You already looked here!

212
00:20:12,513 --> 00:20:15,311
- Where is it?
- I told you. I don't know.

213
00:20:18,354 --> 00:20:21,392
- Where's my phone?
- She doesn't know either.

214
00:20:22,075 --> 00:20:26,115
- Can’t you speak for yourself?
- Stay away from her! Don't touch her.

215
00:20:26,195 --> 00:20:29,427
- Can't you speak?
- I don't know where you left your phone.

216
00:20:29,516 --> 00:20:33,590
Don't hurt her, man! Come on. Take it easy!

217
00:20:45,999 --> 00:20:49,150
- Nina, what's going on?
- I don't know.

218
00:20:49,639 --> 00:20:51,710
The signal's dying.

219
00:21:07,722 --> 00:21:09,520
Who'd you call?

220
00:21:12,843 --> 00:21:14,721
Who is this?

221
00:21:14,804 --> 00:21:20,118
I'm the last thing that you will ever see if
anything happens to my wife or my daughter.

222
00:21:21,325 --> 00:21:23,236
- Where you going?
- To tell Gaines.

223
00:21:23,326 --> 00:21:26,875
What do you think he's gonna do
when he finds out they used your phone?

224
00:21:26,966 --> 00:21:30,164
Jack, get us out of here, please! Hurry!

225
00:21:30,807 --> 00:21:33,162
Teri, I'm gonna find you, I promise. Teri...

226
00:21:36,287 --> 00:21:38,961
Think about it. They called on your phone.

227
00:21:49,289 --> 00:21:51,282
Nina?

228
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:55,051
Tell me you got that trace.

229
00:21:57,131 --> 00:21:59,122
We didn't get it.

230
00:22:11,094 --> 00:22:14,131
- We've located Bauer's car.
- The number matches?

231
00:22:14,214 --> 00:22:16,206
That's right.

232
00:23:05,823 --> 00:23:08,576
- Nina, it's Jack. You still there?
- What's happening?

233
00:23:08,664 --> 00:23:12,737
I got a car. How close
did Milo get with the trace?

234
00:23:12,825 --> 00:23:14,223
25-mile radius.

235
00:23:14,305 --> 00:23:16,341
- Dammit. That's not good enough.
- Sorry.

236
00:23:16,424 --> 00:23:21,102
I've gotta do something. Come on, anything.
Please, help me out. What about Jamey?

237
00:23:21,186 --> 00:23:24,862
- She didn't make it, Jack.
- I don't believe this. Nina, please.

238
00:23:24,946 --> 00:23:27,461
- I've got to find them.
- Hold on.

239
00:23:27,546 --> 00:23:30,460
- Anything yet with that email address?
- It's coming now.

240
00:23:30,547 --> 00:23:33,346
Patch into line two.

241
00:23:34,508 --> 00:23:38,138
It's Tony. I found something
on Jamey's computer that might be a lead.

242
00:23:38,228 --> 00:23:41,221
- What?
- It's a name. Ted Cofell.

243
00:23:41,309 --> 00:23:46,668
I did a search of LA and found him as a CEO
of an investment banking firm in Burbank.

244
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:47,740
That's it?

245
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:48,820
- So...
- There's...

246
00:23:48,911 --> 00:23:51,664
Hold on. Speak one at a time.
Tony, you go first.

247
00:23:51,751 --> 00:23:56,268
So far that's it, but we got Milo decoding the
email right now. We should have more soon.

248
00:23:56,351 --> 00:24:00,265
OK, fine. I'm gonna head over
to Cofell's office. What's the address?

249
00:24:00,352 --> 00:24:04,312
- It's 21500, Riverside Drive.
- 21500, Riverside Drive. Fine.

250
00:24:04,393 --> 00:24:07,703
Tony, Gaines'll try and contact Jamey.
He doesn't know she's dead.

251
00:24:07,794 --> 00:24:09,944
You make sure you keep it that way.

252
00:24:10,034 --> 00:24:13,310
- Nina, you help me navigate through traffic.
- All right.

253
00:24:30,157 --> 00:24:31,989
- Gaines.
- Hello, Ira.

254
00:24:34,999 --> 00:24:39,675
- . Drazen. Where are you?
- Flying into Los Angeles.

255
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:44,150
I'd like to know why the David Palmer
situation hasn't been taken care of.

256
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,312
I don't have to tell you
my brother and I are very disappointed.

257
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:52,077
- We had some bad luck, that's all.
- Bad luck or bad management?

258
00:24:52,161 --> 00:24:55,916
- We have every reason to void the contract.
- There's no need for that.

259
00:24:56,001 --> 00:25:00,075
To have Jack Bauer and David Palmer
in the same city on the same day

260
00:25:00,162 --> 00:25:04,122
and let them slip through
our fingers would be intolerable.

261
00:25:04,203 --> 00:25:07,913
Don't worry. Palmer will be dead
by the end of the day, just as we agreed.

262
00:25:08,004 --> 00:25:09,517
How?

263
00:25:09,604 --> 00:25:12,721
We still have Bauer's family as leverage.

264
00:25:12,805 --> 00:25:16,036
We'll find Bauer and use him
just like we did before.

265
00:25:16,125 --> 00:25:21,564
If plan A doesn't work, you should
have a plan B, not plan A recycled.

266
00:25:21,647 --> 00:25:24,719
Like I said, we still have his family.

267
00:25:24,807 --> 00:25:28,117
If we sit tight, there's
a good chance Bauer will find us.

268
00:25:28,208 --> 00:25:31,359
Then we'll make him the scapegoat
just as before.

269
00:25:31,448 --> 00:25:34,600
My brother wants me
to assess the situation personally.

270
00:25:34,688 --> 00:25:37,122
I land in half an hour.

271
00:25:37,209 --> 00:25:39,963
- I'll join you by 10.30.
- Suit yourself.

272
00:25:40,049 --> 00:25:44,009
If I don't see a substantial improvement
in things in the next hour,

273
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:47,367
I'm going to ask Mr. Cofell
to empty the accounts.

274
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:49,567
You will get zero.

275
00:25:49,651 --> 00:25:52,212
- . Drazen...
- Ira...

276
00:25:52,291 --> 00:25:56,080
you may be in this for the money,
but for my family it's personal.

277
00:25:56,773 --> 00:25:59,287
- I realise that.
- Then realise this.

278
00:26:00,013 --> 00:26:05,168
If things continue to go wrong, the money
isn't all you'll lose. Do you understand?

279
00:26:09,334 --> 00:26:11,212
- This is Sherry Palmer.
- Hello.

280
00:26:11,295 --> 00:26:14,287
I'm sure you're as surprised
as I am that I'm calling you.

281
00:26:14,375 --> 00:26:19,450
I'm surprised you waited this long. I assume
you're calling because David still plans

282
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:22,893
to make the announcement about Keith
and you can't stop him,

283
00:26:22,976 --> 00:26:25,616
so now you want me to stop him?

284
00:26:25,697 --> 00:26:28,371
You've lost whatever influence
you once had with David,

285
00:26:28,458 --> 00:26:33,327
so I'm sure that's gonna be a problem, but
you might be able to stop Maureen Kingsley.

286
00:26:33,418 --> 00:26:34,977
- How?
- I don't know.

287
00:26:35,058 --> 00:26:38,177
I'm sure she has a weakness somewhere.

288
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:42,535
Look, Carl, you don't need to ask me
for any advice on stuff like this.

289
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:47,570
As a matter of fact, I'm already taking care
of the evidence against Keith.

290
00:26:49,061 --> 00:26:52,418
Taking care of it? How?

291
00:26:52,501 --> 00:26:54,891
That's all you really need to know.

292
00:26:56,662 --> 00:27:00,576
- I'm not sure I'm understanding you.
- You don't have to.

293
00:27:00,663 --> 00:27:04,896
But, Sherry, if we give David
a way out of this, make sure he takes it.

294
00:27:15,385 --> 00:27:16,899
- Got it.
- Send it to me.

295
00:27:16,986 --> 00:27:20,377
There was a wire transfer to Ira Gaines
at 2.10am from a Swiss account.

296
00:27:20,466 --> 00:27:24,301
- One million dollars.
- What does Cofell have to do with this?

297
00:27:24,387 --> 00:27:29,143
- I don't know. Maybe it was his money.
- Makes sense. Cofell's in finance.

298
00:27:31,429 --> 00:27:34,739
- Yeah, it's Jack.
- Looks like we have the right Cofell.

299
00:27:34,829 --> 00:27:37,059
Good. What have you got on him?

300
00:27:37,749 --> 00:27:40,423
He was born in Philadelphia, went to Colgate,

301
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:43,423
MBA from UCLA in '88,
worked in investment banking,

302
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:46,025
started his own firm about five years ago.

303
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:48,227
His net worth is in excess of 35 million.

304
00:27:48,311 --> 00:27:51,224
- OK. Good. Patch me through to his office.
- OK.

305
00:27:54,552 --> 00:27:56,908
- Cofell Enterprises.
- Hi. Is Ted there?

306
00:27:56,993 --> 00:27:59,029
He's in a meeting. May I take a message?

307
00:27:59,113 --> 00:28:02,947
I'm a friend from business school.
I'm in town. I hoped we could get together.

308
00:28:03,034 --> 00:28:05,833
As soon as he's out of the meeting
he's going out of town.

309
00:28:05,914 --> 00:28:08,748
That's too bad. How much longer
will he be in his office?

310
00:28:08,835 --> 00:28:11,713
He plans to leave by ten.
Would you like to leave your name?

311
00:28:13,796 --> 00:28:15,309
Hello?

312
00:28:24,797 --> 00:28:28,871
Tell Milo to be ready
in case Teri calls back.

313
00:28:28,958 --> 00:28:31,757
Look, Nina, Division gave me a heads-up.

314
00:28:32,959 --> 00:28:36,474
They're sending in
a provisional replacement for Jack.

315
00:28:37,439 --> 00:28:40,637
They didn't waste any time, did they?

316
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,791
Who is it?

317
00:28:42,881 --> 00:28:47,159
Alberta Green. Didn't she work for you
when you were over at Division?

318
00:28:47,241 --> 00:28:51,360
- Yes, she did. When's she coming?
- Scheduled to arrive at 9.45.

319
00:28:53,202 --> 00:28:55,193
OK.

320
00:28:57,883 --> 00:29:00,921
- CTU. Myers.
- Cofell's there, but he's gonna leave at ten.

321
00:29:01,004 --> 00:29:03,723
I'm passing Culver.
How's the traffic moving east?

322
00:29:03,804 --> 00:29:04,793
I'll check.

323
00:29:07,365 --> 00:29:10,084
Jack, there's another thing.

324
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:13,202
They're bringing in
Alberta Green to run things.

325
00:29:13,286 --> 00:29:16,882
- She's gonna be here in a few minutes.
- Dammit.

326
00:29:17,246 --> 00:29:21,035
Whatever. We'll deal with it.
Now, tell me how to get out of this traffic.

327
00:29:21,127 --> 00:29:24,278
- You'll hit gridlock in about two miles.
- How's Riverside?

328
00:29:24,367 --> 00:29:27,997
It's a little better. You might wanna get off.

329
00:29:28,088 --> 00:29:30,807
OK, look. I'll get off
at the next exit and cut over.

330
00:29:34,649 --> 00:29:37,847
Mom, tell me what happened
between you and Dad.

331
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:41,965
Why'd he move out?

332
00:29:43,211 --> 00:29:46,760
- Kim, let's not talk about this now.
- Why not?

333
00:29:46,851 --> 00:29:49,525
I mean, we both know
there might not be a later.

334
00:29:49,612 --> 00:29:51,603
- Kim...
- Please, Mom.

335
00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:55,648
I wanna know.

336
00:30:04,895 --> 00:30:08,332
I think your father is
the best man that I've ever known.

337
00:30:09,655 --> 00:30:13,205
But he can be... difficult.

338
00:30:14,976 --> 00:30:17,571
And his job doesn't help.

339
00:30:20,177 --> 00:30:24,171
You remember a couple of years ago
when he went away for a few weeks?

340
00:30:24,258 --> 00:30:25,850
Uh...

341
00:30:25,938 --> 00:30:28,407
for some training thing.

342
00:30:29,179 --> 00:30:32,809
That's what he told us,
but I'm sure it was a mission.

343
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:36,572
He wouldn't say
and maybe he probably couldn't.

344
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:43,054
Anyway, when he came back,
he was... different.

345
00:30:43,141 --> 00:30:47,579
He was distant and... preoccupied

346
00:30:47,662 --> 00:30:50,620
and other times he was just angry.

347
00:30:53,543 --> 00:30:56,376
He did everything he could
to keep it from you.

348
00:30:58,144 --> 00:31:01,580
But things between us weren't so great.

349
00:31:04,265 --> 00:31:06,733
I suppose I could have been more patient.

350
00:31:11,345 --> 00:31:13,940
So we decided to try being apart.

351
00:31:17,227 --> 00:31:19,297
But it didn't work.

352
00:31:20,228 --> 00:31:21,900
No.

353
00:31:25,429 --> 00:31:27,420
Good.

354
00:31:29,509 --> 00:31:32,104
I just want us to be together again.

355
00:31:46,472 --> 00:31:50,988
Cofell's taking a private plane and we got
a copy of his flight plan from the FAA.

356
00:31:51,073 --> 00:31:54,349
- He's going to Denver.
- What does that tell us?

357
00:31:54,433 --> 00:31:57,471
We're not sure. We're checking
people in the Denver area

358
00:31:57,554 --> 00:31:59,670
who have known terrorist connections.

359
00:31:59,755 --> 00:32:01,904
So far we haven't got much.

360
00:32:17,357 --> 00:32:19,428
- Hello, Nina.
- Hello, Alberta.

361
00:32:19,518 --> 00:32:22,988
- Nice to see you. You know why I'm here.
- Yes.

362
00:32:24,999 --> 00:32:27,559
Gather everyone around, will you?

363
00:32:28,759 --> 00:32:33,436
OK. Could everyone stop what they're doing
for a moment? I have something to tell you.

364
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:36,240
I'd like to introduce you to Alberta Green.

365
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:40,155
Jack Bauer's been relieved
of his duties here indefinitely.

366
00:32:40,241 --> 00:32:44,359
In the meantime, Alberta's been
appointed Acting Director of CTU.

367
00:32:46,362 --> 00:32:47,955
Good morning.

368
00:32:48,043 --> 00:32:53,675
Things have been out of control here today.
Starting now, they're back in control.

369
00:32:53,764 --> 00:32:58,121
Most of you know that an attempt was made
on Senator Palmer at about 8am.

370
00:32:58,205 --> 00:33:02,881
You may not know that Jack Bauer
was apparently involved in that attempt.

371
00:33:02,965 --> 00:33:05,560
The nature of his involvement isn't clear,

372
00:33:05,645 --> 00:33:08,877
but he has escaped custody
and is considered a fugitive.

373
00:33:08,966 --> 00:33:12,596
We therefore have two objectives:
Find Jack Bauer,

374
00:33:12,687 --> 00:33:18,399
and make a quick and accurate assessment
of the threat, if any, facing Senator Palmer.

375
00:33:18,488 --> 00:33:21,720
I know most of you have been up
more than 24 hours.

376
00:33:21,808 --> 00:33:26,724
Too bad. Nobody so much as yawns
until we accomplish our objective.

377
00:33:26,809 --> 00:33:31,520
If anybody has a problem with that,
now would be a good time to resign.

378
00:33:36,571 --> 00:33:39,404
Good. Let's get back to work.

379
00:33:39,492 --> 00:33:43,690
Specific assignments will be confirmed
or revised within the hour.

380
00:33:51,333 --> 00:33:55,612
Obviously this is awkward,
but we'll get through this. We're pros.

381
00:33:55,694 --> 00:33:58,607
- Of course.
- We'll talk later.

382
00:34:13,617 --> 00:34:16,451
Hold on a minute.

383
00:34:16,538 --> 00:34:20,577
- Is it really true you played basketball?
- I sure did. Georgetown.

384
00:34:20,658 --> 00:34:26,131
- My daddy says Georgetown sucks.
- I need to have a little talk with your daddy.

385
00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:31,055
My daddy also says there will never be
a black president in this country, ever.

386
00:34:33,101 --> 00:34:35,899
Would you give your daddy
a message for me?

387
00:34:36,941 --> 00:34:42,733
Tell him I understand where he's coming
from, but he's wrong, and I'm gonna prove it.

388
00:34:44,903 --> 00:34:47,371
- Tell him that, OK?
- OK.

389
00:34:48,223 --> 00:34:51,182
- I have Frank Ames on the phone.
- What does he want?

390
00:34:51,263 --> 00:34:53,778
- He wouldn't tell me.
- I'll call him back.

391
00:34:53,864 --> 00:34:56,584
He said it was urgent.

392
00:34:57,505 --> 00:35:01,214
He's your biggest contributor.
You can't just blow him off.

393
00:35:06,386 --> 00:35:10,096
I'm very sorry.
Would you excuse me for a minute?

394
00:35:10,186 --> 00:35:12,178
OK.

395
00:35:19,148 --> 00:35:21,219
Frank. This is kind of a bad time.

396
00:35:21,308 --> 00:35:24,460
- Well, it's about to get worse.
- What do you mean?

397
00:35:24,549 --> 00:35:27,986
I just got out of a meeting with Carl,
Phil Tuttle and Bob Jorgensen.

398
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:31,950
- About what?
- George Ferragamo, your son's therapist.

399
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:35,467
"The freshman and the transfers
from school are... "

400
00:35:35,551 --> 00:35:38,429
The three of you have given
a lot of money to my campaign,

401
00:35:38,512 --> 00:35:40,980
but my son's therapist
is none of your business.

402
00:35:41,072 --> 00:35:43,745
He is when he's accusing
your son of murder.

403
00:35:43,832 --> 00:35:47,712
He's a problem, and Tuttle
and Jorgensen don't like problems.

404
00:35:47,793 --> 00:35:50,991
They told Carl to get rid of it, permanently.

405
00:35:51,674 --> 00:35:55,986
- I've played hardball all my life, but this...
- What are you saying? They told Carl to...

406
00:35:56,075 --> 00:35:59,955
Listen, I'm washing my hands of this
and your whole campaign.

407
00:36:00,035 --> 00:36:02,595
- Frank...
- I am out of it, David.

408
00:36:07,716 --> 00:36:10,311
What was that about?

409
00:36:11,677 --> 00:36:15,114
I need to talk to Carl, now.

410
00:36:40,922 --> 00:36:43,517
You wanted to see me?

411
00:36:46,843 --> 00:36:49,233
- Give us five minutes.
- Certainly.

412
00:36:52,245 --> 00:36:55,317
I don't know where Jack is.
We haven't talked since this morning.

413
00:36:55,404 --> 00:36:57,839
- Since he escaped with a hostage?
- That's right.

414
00:36:57,925 --> 00:37:00,679
I'm not sure I believe you.

415
00:37:03,366 --> 00:37:07,997
If you tell me where he is, I'll do what I can
to make sure nothing heavy falls on you.

416
00:37:08,087 --> 00:37:10,806
I told you. I don't know.

417
00:37:12,687 --> 00:37:16,363
From what I've heard, there are
very few secrets between you and Jack.

418
00:37:16,448 --> 00:37:19,839
Jack doesn't trust anyone, including me.

419
00:37:19,929 --> 00:37:23,808
Getting involved with Jack was one
of the biggest mistakes I've ever made.

420
00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:29,011
Not that I'm judging you, Nina, but
there's a right way to do these things.

421
00:37:29,091 --> 00:37:32,208
Let 'em screw you.
Don't let 'em screw you over.

422
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:36,170
Look, if you don't have any more pearls
of wisdom, I'd like to get back to work.

423
00:37:36,252 --> 00:37:38,083
By all means.

424
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:45,369
- Cofell Enterprises.
- It's Ted's friend from business school.

425
00:37:45,454 --> 00:37:49,527
I'm sorry, but I'm in the building. I hoped
I could come up and say a quick hello.

426
00:37:49,614 --> 00:37:54,291
- Will Ted be there for a few more minutes?
- I'm sorry, sir. He's on his way out.

427
00:37:54,375 --> 00:37:57,048
- What floor is Cofell Enterprises on?
- 14.

428
00:37:58,096 --> 00:38:00,087
Thank you.

429
00:38:06,937 --> 00:38:09,736
- Nancy, could you call my car, please?
- OK.

430
00:38:09,817 --> 00:38:14,016
Better head to the airport a little early today.
The radio said the traffic was slow.

431
00:38:14,098 --> 00:38:19,856
Of course. Mr. Cofell, a friend of yours from
business school is on the way up to see you.

432
00:38:19,939 --> 00:38:20,974
On his way now?

433
00:38:21,059 --> 00:38:23,779
- I tried to stop him.
- Did he say who it was?

434
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:26,932
He didn't give his name.
He's probably selling something.

435
00:38:27,021 --> 00:38:29,535
- Don't give him my cell number.
- Have a good trip.

436
00:38:29,621 --> 00:38:32,898
- Thank you.
- Don't forget your phone.

437
00:38:32,981 --> 00:38:36,770
Hey, Lewis, just wanted to let you know
that Mr. Cofell is on his way down.

438
00:38:36,862 --> 00:38:39,137
Excuse me. Where's Mr. Cofell?

439
00:38:39,223 --> 00:38:42,420
Oh, I'm so sorry.
He just stepped into the elevator.

440
00:38:44,343 --> 00:38:48,815
Where was he going? Down to
the parking garage? It's all right, never mind.

441
00:39:01,587 --> 00:39:05,978
Nothing to worry about. There's a 30-second
reset, then we continue down automatically.

442
00:39:06,067 --> 00:39:09,265
It's probably a false alarm anyhow.

443
00:39:50,995 --> 00:39:54,431
- Excuse me. Are you Mr. Cofell's driver?
- Yeah, that's right.

444
00:39:54,515 --> 00:39:58,111
I'm a federal agent.
Where are you going today?

445
00:39:58,196 --> 00:40:01,029
- To the airport.
- On what business?

446
00:40:01,117 --> 00:40:03,790
Look, I'm just his driver.
Is there a problem here?

447
00:40:03,877 --> 00:40:05,869
Come with me a second.

448
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,352
Thank you.

449
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:24,238
- Have a nice day, Mr. Cofell.
- Thank you.

450
00:40:25,401 --> 00:40:27,392
Valet.

451
00:40:36,243 --> 00:40:39,280
Mark, could you turn the air on
back here, please?

452
00:41:01,727 --> 00:41:03,240
"Then they began to laugh. "

453
00:41:03,327 --> 00:41:06,842
"They began to say things like
'Oh, you remember him, don't you?"'

454
00:41:06,928 --> 00:41:09,601
"'Doesn't he live with you? Sure he does. "'

455
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:21,688
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine. It's nothing.

456
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:25,288
- He hurt you, didn't he?
- No, no, honey. I'm fine.
