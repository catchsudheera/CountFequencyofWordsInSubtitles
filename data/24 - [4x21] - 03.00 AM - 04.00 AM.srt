1
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:18,113
<i>People of America,</i>
<i>you wake up today to a different world. </i>

2
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:22,591
<i>One of your own nuclear weapons</i>
<i>has been used against you. </i>

3
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,671
"Wake up today to a different world. "

4
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:28,036
Do we take that literally?
He'll set off the warhead before dawn?

5
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,356
A CTU analyst named Chloe O'Brian

6
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:34,956
secured a hard drive belonging
to one of Marwan's associates.

7
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,271
It may contain information
that could lead us to the warhead.

8
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:42,035
I'll give you full authority to act as my proxy
whenever you think it's necessary.

9
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:46,398
Mr Koo. There's a man in your consulate
by the name of Lee Jong.

10
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,109
We need to take Mr Lee into custody
immediately for questioning.

11
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:54,751
Mr Lee is a Chinese citizen. I can't hand him
over to you without going through channels.

12
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,591
<i> Jack. Is there any doubt in your</i>
<i>mind that Lee is working with Marwan?</i>

13
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,399
No, sir. The emails he sent
left no room for doubt.

14
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,710
Then we have to get Lee now
and find out what he knows.

15
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,596
Yes, sir.

16
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,639
No one connected with the government can
admit to knowing anything about this. Ever.

17
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,076
I got him. Hostiles in pursuit.
Bring up the van.

18
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,355
Let's go.

19
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,914
Mr President. The consul is dead.

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,472
He was shot when armed men broke into this
building and took Mr Lee with them by force.

21
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:31,519
Mr Lee. Tell me where Habib Marwan is.
Dammit, we're losing him.

22
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,757
What is it?

23
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,832
We can drain off the fluid,
but we gotta get him to surgery now.

24
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,671
Jack, what's going on?

25
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,957
This is our only connection
to a stolen warhead. Save him.

26
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,395
- I already have a patient.
- You have a new one.

27
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,755
If you don't save him, millions will die.

28
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,400
- Jack!
- I have my orders. I'm doing my job.

29
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,677
Paul's crashing.

30
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,954
Jack. He's dead.

31
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,395
Jack, you son of a bitch!
You killed him!

32
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,837
Gauze.
- Is he gonna make it?

33
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,275
- We'll do our best.
- I just need him long enough

34
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,351
to get the information about Marwan.

35
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:25,468
I know, Jack. You made me aware of that
when you forced me to sacrifice Paul Raines.

36
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,232
One milligram atropine.

37
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,311
- What is it?
- I don't have time now.

38
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,630
- OK, Jack, we need to leave.
Tape.

39
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:37,033
I'm gonna have
a milligram of atropine standing by.

40
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,669
Gauze.
Gauze. Want me to run this in now?

41
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,671
I'll be right outside.

42
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,400
I'm sorry.

43
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,838
I'm so sorry.

44
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,233
How could you?

45
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,993
How could you kill him, Jack?
How could you do it?

46
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,674
- Come here. Come here.
- No...

47
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,791
No... No, Jack, I can't...

48
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,633
I can't be near you right now.

49
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,439
Please, Audrey.

50
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,318
Just tell me what you want me to do.

51
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,914
Leave. I want you to leave, Jack.

52
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:37,114
Jack, call the White House right away. Mike
Novick needs to speak with you. It's urgent.

53
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,316
OK, fine.

54
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,868
What?

55
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,712
Paul Raines just died.

56
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:49,511
There was only one doctor, and I had to make
a choice between Lee's life and Paul's.

57
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,398
And I chose Lee.

58
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,428
You did the right thing, Jack.

59
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,591
You OK?

60
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,509
No, I'm not OK.

61
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,797
I'm sorry. Just tell me
when Lee's out of surgery.

62
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,189
I will.

63
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,519
- <i> Mike Novick's office. </i>
- This is Jack Bauer.

64
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,160
<i>Please hold. </i>

65
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,232
Hello, Jack. Have you gotten
anything useful out of Lee?

66
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:30,198
- No, he's still in surgery.
- How's that coming along?

67
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:35,673
- Not great, but he's hanging in there.
- We took a huge risk getting this guy

68
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,228
on the assumption
he can help us find the warhead.

69
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,675
Trust me, Mike, I know.

70
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,192
- And we also have a new situation.
- What is it?

71
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:48,796
When you broke into the Chinese consulate,
Koo Yin, the consul, was shot.

72
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,075
That's not possible. My men never fired.

73
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:55,392
Then he was accidentally hit
by one of his own people.

74
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,358
- How badly was he hurt?
- He died, Jack.

75
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,750
- Oh, my God.
- <i>Talk to the members of your team. </i>

76
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,311
Make sure that each one of them has an alibi
for where they were during the ambush.

77
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,552
- OK.
- This is an extremely incendiary situation.

78
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,749
I'm about to talk to President Palmer now.

79
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:22,072
We're trying to avoid
a serious confrontation with China.

80
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,550
We'll handle it from here. Thanks, Mike.

81
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,751
How did this happen?

82
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,110
The network security module lit up.

83
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:52,318
- Someone's trying to jam our servers.
- Could this be a high network load?

84
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,517
No, it's a denial of service attempt.
What do you want me to do?

85
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,558
- Did it do any damage?
- No, the system is self-defending.

86
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:02,189
Use the Security Auditor tool,
it'll lead us to Marwan's network.

87
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,475
That was my point from the start.

88
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,790
Chloe.

89
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:12,398
We're in active code. We don't have time for
your personality disorder. You understand?

90
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,835
Chloe? Yes or no?

91
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,353
Yes, sir.

92
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,550
- <i>This is Yasir. </i>
- Is the warhead in place?

93
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:29,474
- Yes, but I can't jam their satellite.
- <i>You assured me you could handle it. </i>

94
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:34,395
CTU must have just installed new software.
This wasn't in place last week.

95
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,948
We move our schedule forward by an hour.

96
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,350
There won't be as many casualties
if people aren't at work.

97
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,910
If you can't jam their satellite signal,
they'll find us.

98
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,390
- We can't let that happen.
- <i>I understand. </i>

99
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,035
How long do we keep
the president in the dark?

100
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,033
Eventually he'll find out that you
authorised the raid on the consulate.

101
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,918
We have to keep it from him
as long as we can.

102
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,276
- Were you able to find Jack?
- Yes, he's back at CTU.

103
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,070
The man they grabbed at the consulate,
Lee Jong, is still in surgery.

104
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,232
- Was he able to tell us anything?
- No.

105
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:15,199
- What did Jack say about the consul's death?
- It wasn't our people who fired.

106
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:20,308
Chinese won't care.
He died as a result of our trespass.

107
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,473
We have to construct a scenario that
doesn't implicate the US government.

108
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,755
They must know we did this.

109
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:30,116
We called them about Lee Jong
half an hour before the abduction.

110
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:35,069
The Chinese don't want a confrontation
any more than we do.

111
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:39,310
If we can create plausible deniability,
they may play along.

112
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,391
How do we do that?

113
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,514
Call CTU. Have them find out
which anti-Chinese factions

114
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,637
have attacked their consulates
in the last five years.

115
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,395
Most of these groups
you're talking about are Asian extremists.

116
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,789
Bauer's team was predominantly American.

117
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:01,112
Bauer's team was masked.
No one saw their faces.

118
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,988
Curtis, come here.

119
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,275
The Chinese consul was shot
and killed during Lee's extraction.

120
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,636
- How? We never got a shot off.
- It must have been friendly fire.

121
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,915
We've gotta make our alibis cross-check.

122
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,471
No one outside of this operation is to know
we were near the Chinese consulate.

123
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:42,597
- Jack, are we gonna be brought into this?
- I don't know yet.

124
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:46,434
All I know is, now that the consul's
been killed, everything's changed.

125
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:51,389
It's our responsibility to make sure the
US government is never implicated in this.

126
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:54,313
Don't worry, Jack.
Everyone here gets it.

127
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:58,871
- OK. Curtis, you advise the rest of the team.
- You got it.

128
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,594
Yasir.

129
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:12,390
They're ready for you to make the changes.
Do you think they'll find us before we launch?

130
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,393
Not if I move up the launch.
They're looking for the warhead in their cities.

131
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,711
They have no idea that
it's going to be delivered by missile.

132
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,468
- <i>Morrison?</i>
- Yes, sir?

133
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:28,190
<i>Open up the guidance firmware. </i>
<i>I'm going to upload a new instruction set. </i>

134
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,669
Yes, sir.

135
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,111
<i>OK, go ahead. </i>

136
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:45,959
We'll be ready to start the launch
as soon as I've reprogrammed the onboard.

137
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,598
Good.

138
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,796
Prep your databases.
When Lee come to, we have to move quickly.

139
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,440
- What about the warhead?
- We're meeting on it now.

140
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:14,592
I need you to free up a server
for a large DOD block transfer,

141
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,319
through a locked channel from Heller's office.

142
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,834
Has that been authorised?

143
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,679
No, not yet. I still have to talk to Audrey.

144
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,399
- Well, that's gonna be weird.
- What?

145
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,314
Talking to Audrey. You had to do
what you did and her husband died.

146
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,836
- Probably destroyed your relationship...
- Free up the server.

147
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,070
OK.

148
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:43,839
Jack, I just want you to know, if you ever need
anyone to talk to, as a friend, I'm here for you.

149
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,390
Not now, but later.
When things calm down.

150
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,551
Thanks.

151
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,030
Audrey, I'm sorry to bother you.

152
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,634
I need you to authorise a block transfer.

153
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:06,794
We need all pertinent DOD databases
sent over here to CTU.

154
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,156
Were you able to keep Lee alive?

155
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,913
Yeah, he's stabilised.

156
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,514
All right. I'll call Marcy.

157
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,071
Thank you.

158
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:26,231
The warhead was stolen in eastern Iowa.
We don't know how it's being transported.

159
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,915
- Are we monitoring air traffic?
Nothing's been picked up.

160
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,719
On the ground,
how far could they have gone?

161
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,793
A 300-mile radius, which includes
three metropolitan areas.

162
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,873
- Have those cities been alerted?
- The president wants that restricted.

163
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:44,032
We've raised alert levels,
but haven't mentioned specifics.

164
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,998
Marwan and his people
have control of the warhead.

165
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:50,231
We have to figure out
when and where he's gonna set it off.

166
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,118
Look at everything
from satellite to local police.

167
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,556
We have a small window.
It's still the middle of the night.

168
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:00,599
A trail is going to be a hell of a lot easier
to follow now, than in two hours

169
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:04,639
when people start going to work.
Let's get to it.

170
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,039
Howard Bern.

171
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:40,229
There's a program at Division
you can filter those markers through.

172
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,276
Yeah?

173
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:48,356
<i> I've a Mr Cheng from the Chinese</i>
<i>consulate who wants to speak to Michelle. </i>

174
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,349
Michelle Dessler.

175
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,875
My name is Cheng Zhi,
head of security for the Chinese consulate.

176
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:01,511
I'm sure your office is aware of the incident
that happened here earlier tonight.

177
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,479
Yes, we were sorry to hear about it.
Is there anything we can do to help?

178
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:08,472
I would like to come
and discuss this matter with you.

179
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:12,678
Of course. My office would be glad
to make an appointment in the morning.

180
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,751
No, I need to do that right now.

181
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:19,470
I'm afraid that's impossible. You must know
we're in the middle of a security crisis...

182
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:23,348
The murder of our consul on Chinese soil
could be construed as an act of war.

183
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,353
- What's that have to do with us?
- <i>I believe your agency stormed the consulate</i>

184
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,431
<i>and kidnapped Lee Jong. </i>

185
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,310
That is an outrageous accusation.

186
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:39,315
An hour earlier, your government called and
asked for permission to speak to Lee Jong.

187
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:44,235
<i>30 minutes later, we were attacked. It is</i>
<i>unlikely these two events are unrelated. </i>

188
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,632
- I'm sorry, Mr Cheng, I can't help you.
- I suggest you cooperate voluntarily,

189
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,757
otherwise I'll be forced
to go above you on this.

190
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,274
I'm sure you'll do what you have to.

191
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:57,352
<i>I mean no disrespect,</i>
<i>but I do have to get back to work. </i>

192
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:02,036
Very well, Ms Dessler.
You will be hearing from me soon.

193
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,833
Comm confirmed we got the data. Thank you.

194
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,797
You're welcome.

195
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,031
Yeah.

196
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:31,430
- You should get some rest.
- With everything going on, I can't.

197
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:34,478
- You could go back to the hotel.
- Don't tell me what to do.

198
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,551
I'm sorry.

199
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,200
What?

200
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,873
Jack, what do you want from me?

201
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:52,512
You made a choice that killed Paul
and I'm trying to deal with it.

202
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,238
We both have a job.
Let's just do it.

203
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:02,713
Jack. Michelle says the head of security
at the Chinese consulate just called.

204
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,236
He made it sound like he has evidence
linking CTU to the abduction.

205
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:10,199
- What kind of evidence?
- He didn't say, he wants to come talk to us.

206
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:14,034
They don't have any evidence.
We don't have time to deal with them now.

207
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,429
I agree, but we don't have much choice.

208
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:19,830
I need you to help me figure out
how to deal with this, Jack.

209
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:24,311
- I need to check on Lee. I'll get back to you.
- All right.

210
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,351
CTU just sent this over.

211
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,515
These five groups have all made attempts
to sabotage Chinese targets

212
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,636
around the globe in the last two years.

213
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,075
- This group.
- People's Freedom Coalition?

214
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,756
They've referenced Lee Jong's involvement
with the Chinese nuclear programme.

215
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:50,799
So an attack and the grab of Lee Jong
by this group would be plausible.

216
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,269
It would allow the Chinese to save face.

217
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,592
If the Chinese can't prove we entered
the consulate, that may be all they need.

218
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,274
If you want, I can start leaking it to the media.

219
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,351
Do it.

220
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,911
Mr President.

221
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,070
- David, what have you done?
- Excuse me?

222
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:13,870
I just got a call from the Secretary of State
about a covert action against the Chinese.

223
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,871
That's correct. I sanctioned it.

224
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,758
- Why would you do such a thing?
- It was the only option.

225
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,593
You know how fragile
our relationship with China is?

226
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,797
An attack on their consulate.
A military engagement.

227
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:29,908
A covert operation, similar to those carried
out on a routine basis around the world.

228
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,356
Don't give me a social studies lesson.
We marched on Chinese soil,

229
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,877
we kidnapped one of their nationals, and
in the process the Chinese consul was killed.

230
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,554
- We were unlucky, sir.
- Unlucky?

231
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:45,394
I'd say we were unlucky.
That's the kind of thing that could start a war!

232
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:49,109
How do I fight terrorists
while provoking a nuclear superpower?

233
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,512
I would advise you to calm down, sir,
if we're gonna get through this day.

234
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,478
We didn't bring this crisis on ourselves.

235
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:59,711
But we're gonna be the ones to settle it.

236
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:05,397
This is a dirty business, and we're gonna
have to get our hands dirty to clean it up.

237
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:10,349
Now, please, Mr President,
you brought me here to help you.

238
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,431
Let me do it.

239
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,958
- Tony, what's the latest on Lee?
- He's out of surgery.

240
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,554
He'll be able to respond to questions soon.

241
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,871
When that happens,
I want everyone from comm on standby.

242
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,430
Whatever information Lee gives us
I want worked up with no time lags.

243
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,829
- <i> We're clear about this?</i>
- Yes, sir.

244
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,239
<i>Good. </i>

245
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:57,998
Secretary of State Taylor just authorised
the head of security at the consulate

246
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:02,278
- to come here and question us about the raid.
- What? In the middle of all this?

247
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,874
All right, this breaks down very simply.

248
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,829
They want to prove we attacked the consulate
tonight. We have to make sure they can't.

249
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:14,152
- That ambush has to land on someone.
- Novick's working on that from Washington.

250
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,913
We just have to make sure
all our bases are covered.

251
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,117
Finding that nuclear warhead
is our number one priority.

252
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,191
I'll go over the strategy with Jack.

253
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:26,990
When Cheng gets here, send him to the
situation room, all visible screens masked.

254
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,071
OK.

255
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:37,877
This situation with the consulate
is dragging us down.

256
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,554
We shouldn't divert resources
from the warhead.

257
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:45,509
Well, hopefully this will just be a formality,
and we can get rid of him quickly.

258
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:53,669
If we don't get information from Lee, Audrey's
husband will have died for no reason.

259
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,638
What is she still doing here?

260
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:01,748
I think she wants to stay busy
so she doesn't have to think about it.

261
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,991
It's funny.
When I met Audrey this afternoon,

262
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:09,358
it seemed like she and Jack
were totally together.

263
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,876
A few hours later, everything's changed.

264
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,392
Michelle.

265
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,388
I hate being without you.

266
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,314
I never wanted it to be this way.

267
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,315
<i> Mr Cheng's here. </i>

268
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:49,635
Send him to the situation room.
Buchanan and Jack are waiting there.

269
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:53,110
- Shouldn't we keep him more isolated?
- <i>No. </i>

270
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,671
We have to give the impression
we have nothing to hide.

271
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:05,637
- Mr Cheng? I'm Curtis Manning.
- Hello, Mr Manning.

272
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:12,432
Our regional director is waiting for us
in the situation room. If you'll follow me?

273
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:22,068
Mr Cheng. Bill Buchanan.
Pleasure to meet you in person.

274
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,515
- My condolences for your consul.
- Thank you.

275
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,433
Jack Bauer from the DOD.
He's working for us today.

276
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,590
Mr Cheng, please, take a seat.

277
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:33,832
I know of Mr Bauer, of course,
from his previous service to this country.

278
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,992
We knew you were in Los Angeles today.
When did you arrive?

279
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,913
Flew in a couple days ago,
with Secretary Heller.

280
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,594
I assume, then, Secretary Heller is still here?

281
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:45,319
For security reasons he's at our district office.

282
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:50,315
- Why aren't you with him?
- We felt I could be more helpful here at CTU.

283
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:55,793
- That's odd.
- Not really. I used to run this office.

284
00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:01,796
If there's anyone capable of leading a covert
operation at short notice, you'd be ideal.

285
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:05,350
- Mr Cheng, this kind of...
- It's all right, Bill, I've got it.

286
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,399
Mr Cheng, I can assure you
that neither CTU nor I

287
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:15,476
had anything to do with the terrible events
that took place at your consulate tonight.

288
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:20,708
I assume you know this man.
Howard Bern, one of your field agents.

289
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:25,874
This was taken by one of
our surveillance cameras tonight.

290
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:31,078
- This photograph has been altered.
- To make it clearer.

291
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:34,709
Or to set up a scenario
you can utilise for political propaganda.

292
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,394
No. We ran this image through our database.

293
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:40,517
The computer picked Mr Bern
as a near-perfect match.

294
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:44,718
Did your database include members
of the People's Freedom Coalition?

295
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:48,076
According to our information,
they're most likely behind this.

296
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:51,152
That would be pointless.
This man is not Asian.

297
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:56,030
Mr Cheng, we both know that the PFC has
initiated terrorist activity around the globe,

298
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,714
utilising European mercenaries,
half a dozen of which

299
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,712
are a closer match
to this photo than Agent Bern.

300
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,234
I take it Mr Bern is not available to question?

301
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,515
- No, he's not here tonight.
- Of course.

302
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:11,230
You know it would not be in America's best
interests to provoke the Chinese government.

303
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,436
Then what are we playing these games for?

304
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:17,274
30 minutes before we were attacked,
you asked us to give up Lee Jong.

305
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:21,956
Before our government can comply, the
consul was attacked, Lee Jong disappeared.

306
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:26,511
Now you tell me you do not have Lee Jong,
Howard Bern is not available.

307
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:29,910
- What are you hiding?
Nothing. We're just extremely busy.

308
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,560
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

309
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,709
This is Bauer.

310
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,836
We are faced with unprecedented...

311
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:38,354
Are we positive?

312
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,829
OK.

313
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,917
Thank you. We have confirmation
on Marwan's last location.

314
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,232
Follow up on that. I'll handle
the rest of Mr Cheng's questions.

315
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:56,829
I'd like to see the hourlies for Mr Bauer.

316
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:59,798
I'll see what I can do.

317
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,876
- O'Brian.
- Chloe, it's Jack.

318
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:07,748
Have Bern meet me in the east corridor.
Get a chopper ready now.

319
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,912
Meet Jack in the east corridor now.

320
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,232
- <i> Flight ops. </i>
- O'Brian.

321
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,959
Jack Bauer's requesting
a helicopter standing by.

322
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,110
- <i>OK. Done. </i>
- Thank you.

323
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,477
- Follow me.
- What's going on?

324
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:28,120
Camera at the consulate picked up your face.

325
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:31,749
- I was wearing my mask.
- Trust me, I saw the freeze-frame. It was you.

326
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:37,358
Jack, the guy ripped the mask from my face,
I pulled it right back down. I had no idea.

327
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,113
Leave the city.
We're working out a scenario.

328
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:43,158
You're gonna have to answer
questions for the Chinese.

329
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,754
I didn't think anyone saw me,
so I didn't bring it up.

330
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,559
- Don't worry, we'll handle it.
- I'm sorry, Jack.

331
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,712
You gotta go.
There's a chopper waiting for you.

332
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,392
This is Bauer.

333
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,516
Lee Jong's coming out of anaesthesia.

334
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,592
<i>He should be ready for questioning. </i>
<i>Agent Raab's there. </i>

335
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,671
I'm on my way.

336
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,198
- You ready?
- All my databases are active.

337
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:18,352
Doctor, that's enough.
He's mine now. Thank you.

338
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,795
Tell him he's in critical condition.

339
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,509
I'll ask questions. When he answers,
I'll let the doctor treat him.

340
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,153
- He understands.
- I know he worked on the warhead.

341
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:37,711
Now he needs to tell us where it is.

342
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:48,315
He doesn't know,
but he knows where Marwan might be.

343
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,756
Might be? In the van he told me
he knew where he was.

344
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:03,193
- Marwan's been moving around.
- Where?

345
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,756
- He has three locations Marwan's using.
- What are they?

346
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,637
- The Rockland building.
- We know.

347
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,711
- A bar downtown.
- We know that too.

348
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,917
- A factory on Sixth.
- Where on Sixth?

349
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,994
- Sixth and Alameda.
- Get me an exact address.

350
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,196
That's the one we're looking for.

351
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:45,230
Assemble a team, make sure Curtis is on it.
They need to be ready to move now.

352
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,628
- Audrey.
- Yes?

353
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,792
The investigator from the Chinese
wants to talk to you.

354
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,030
Why does he want to talk to me?

355
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:13,510
To protect Jack's cover,
we put together some new hourlies.

356
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:17,479
They show you and Jack
working together at the time of the ambush.

357
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:21,075
- Buchanan wants me to lie to protect Jack?
- Not to protect Jack.

358
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:24,789
To protect the United States government.

359
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,755
Is that gonna be a problem?

360
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,150
Where are the hourlies?

361
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,232
Edgar's sending them to your system.

362
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:40,233
- I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this.
- I understand.

363
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:45,713
But whatever you decide,
you're still gonna have to talk to Cheng.

364
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:20,073
- What's happening?
- Lee gave us a probable location on Marwan.

365
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,435
- I'm being called in for questioning.
- By who?

366
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:25,080
Cheng, from the Chinese consulate.

367
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,071
Come here. Why you?

368
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:31,631
Buchanan modified the hourlies so it looked
like you were with me during the abduction.

369
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:35,952
Whatever Buchanan laid out, stick to it.
We need to sideline Cheng now.

370
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:39,999
Why? Lee's incriminated himself,
the Chinese won't try to protect him.

371
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:44,358
That's not what this is. The Chinese
consul was killed during Lee's extraction.

372
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:48,069
- The government cannot be held responsible.
- What are you doing?

373
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:52,119
You have broken every major protocol
set by CTU and the DOD for what?

374
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:55,351
Is any of this working?

375
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:59,558
You're still alive.
Your father's still alive.

376
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:04,589
And we stopped all but one of the power
plants from melting down. Yeah, it's working.

377
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:08,309
And we have to fight to keep it working.

378
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:11,073
Do what you have to, Audrey.

379
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:14,118
I'm sorry, I've gotta go.

380
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,112
Thank you.

381
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,394
Hello.

382
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:26,918
- I got Jack's approach on Marwan's location.
- Good.

383
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,879
Upload it to the teams, send a copy to Tony.
He's running point on this end.

384
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,951
You got it.

385
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:38,719
I am surprised that after you were kidnapped,
that you stayed on to work here.

386
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:42,349
- That must have been very difficult.
- I wasn't physically hurt.

387
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:45,398
I want to help find the people
who planned these attacks.

388
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:50,793
Very admirable. Now, I looked through
the hourlies for Mr Bauer, your associate.

389
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:55,749
I notice from 1am to 3am, you and he
were working on some data processing tasks.

390
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,195
Yes, that's correct.

391
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:00,475
Who did you give the information to?

392
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,790
Edgar Stiles.

393
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,553
Why does that matter?

394
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:10,634
They go to all this trouble to reenlist
a man who used to run this place, Jack Bauer,

395
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,713
- and he's doing data processing?
- It's much more subtle than it sounds.

396
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:17,268
There are hundreds of lists
to cross-reference,

397
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,875
and with Mr Bauer's experience,
we were able to narrow the search.

398
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,269
I am surprised.

399
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,271
Why's that?

400
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:29,558
Meaning no disrespect, the log shows
that your husband, Paul Raines,

401
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:32,029
was at the clinic during those same hours.

402
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:34,554
And unfortunately he passed away.

403
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:39,396
What's your point?

404
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,312
I don't believe you were
with Jack Bauer, mining data.

405
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:46,233
You were waiting
for your husband in surgery,

406
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,959
and you're lying to me now
to cover for Mr Bauer.

407
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:53,318
Mr Cheng, I'm not going to allow you
to stand there and accuse my people of lying.

408
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:56,710
And I'm not going to stand here
to endure half-baked alibis.

409
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,791
You can believe whatever you want.

410
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:03,237
My answers stand. Now, if we are done,
I do have to get back to work.

411
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,311
If you'll excuse me.

412
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,869
- Manning.
- <i> President Palmer for Jack. </i>

413
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,518
It's the White House.

414
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,875
- This is Bauer.
- Jack, this is David Palmer.

415
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:22,157
- Mr President.
- CTU tells me you got something from Lee.

416
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,276
We got a location on Habib Marwan.

417
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:27,955
We're en route with tactical teams.
We're hopeful we can end this soon.

418
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:31,112
I hope you're right.
This warhead can detonate any moment.

419
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,189
We know, sir.

420
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,952
Jack.

421
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:38,750
Tell me about the representative from the
Chinese consulate, Cheng. Is he still at CTU?

422
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:41,559
- He was there when we left.
- Are we OK there?

423
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:44,632
They have a surveillance photo
of one of my team members.

424
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:49,748
We told them the photo wasn't clear enough
to be conclusive. That'll hold them for a while.

425
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:52,229
I see. Thank you, Jack.

426
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:55,551
- Thank you, Mr President.
- <i>And good luck. </i>

427
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,631
Thank you, sir.

428
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,039
All right, Mike. I'm gonna need you
to advise the president

429
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:06,156
that Cheng has to leave CTU now.

430
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,993
Logan was clear
that he wanted Cheng to have access.

431
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:12,436
And he has.
But now Cheng is slowing them down.

432
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:15,717
He's got to go.
CTU needs to be able to do their job

433
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:18,598
without the added pressure of a cover-up.

434
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:23,276
You think you can get
President Logan to sign off on that?

435
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,157
I'll see what I can do.

436
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:32,598
Yes. No, not now, Keith, I have
too many things to deal with first.

437
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:36,673
Yes, you do that. Thank you.
What is it, Mike?

438
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:41,959
The Chinese security officer, Cheng, is still at
CTU, and seems to be slowing things down.

439
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:45,350
He wouldn't be there if Palmer
hadn't attacked his consulate.

440
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,910
- It's too late to change that now, sir.
- Yes.

441
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:55,075
Yes, it is. If we order Cheng to leave CTU now,
it'll look like we've got something to hide,

442
00:33:55,160 --> 00:34:02,510
and we'll just be giving the Chinese all the
justification they need to escalate this crisis.

443
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:05,751
If we don't find that warhead
before it's deployed,

444
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:08,434
ten million Americans
could face annihilation.

445
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,988
We could be at war with a billion Chinese.

446
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:14,470
My advice is to worry about
the Americans now and the Chinese later.

447
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,949
Your advice? Or David Palmer's advice?

448
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,473
Both of ours.

449
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:22,633
When I agreed to let you bring Palmer in,
it wasn't so you could ally against me.

450
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:25,712
- That's not what's happening.
- Tell me what's happening.

451
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:29,873
You and David Palmer are running
this country while I'm taking phone calls.

452
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:33,953
Would you like me to ask
President Palmer to leave?

453
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:39,671
No.

454
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:46,793
Call CTU. Tell Bill Buchanan
to escort Mr Cheng out of the building.

455
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,275
Yes, Mr President.

456
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,918
Curtis. Put Michaels in play now.

457
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:27,438
We're outside the factory, our men are in
position. Can you confirm Marwan's inside?

458
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:30,353
I can't say, but I'm detecting
a microwave uplink.

459
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:33,398
- Can you intercept it?
- No, it's got encryption.

460
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,675
OK, thanks.

461
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,993
- We ready?
- Yeah. How do we confirm Marwan's inside?

462
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:43,550
We don't. But we're out of time.
We move now. Give all teams a go.

463
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:46,234
All right.
All teams, it's a go.

464
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,274
Mr Buchanan, this matter will be pursued.

465
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:57,830
I will return with a formal order
for an extensive investigation.

466
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:02,357
I understand. If I were you I'd focus my
attention on the People's Freedom Coalition.

467
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,908
I'm quite sure they are your perpetrators.

468
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,434
- We'll do everything we can to help you.
- Sir.

469
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,953
Excuse me.

470
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:13,717
- Jack's team's outside the building.
- I'll be right there.

471
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:18,078
Mr Cheng, excuse me, please.
I have to get back.

472
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:22,438
- My men will escort you from the building.
- Thank you.

473
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,111
Edgar?
- Thank you.

474
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:30,670
Excuse me. Edgar Stiles?
Communication analyst, right?

475
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,079
Yeah, I'm busy.

476
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:35,470
I forgot to ask Mr Buchanan one thing.
Maybe you could help.

477
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,915
- You should ask him.
- It's not classified.

478
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,755
Audrey Raines had mentioned to me that you
were helping her earlier with some DOD files.

479
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:47,197
- Yeah, until she was called to the clinic.
- So it was just you and Jack then?

480
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,874
- What?
- Edgar, come here.

481
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:52,713
- I have to go. Bye.
- Thank you.

482
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:58,636
- Idiot. Just keep your mouth shut.
- I didn't say anything.

483
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,868
- Michaels, are you in position?
- <i>Roger that. </i>

484
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:19,111
- He's at your two o'clock. Take him out.
- <i>Copy that. </i>

485
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,598
- <i> We're ready. </i>
- Start the sequence.

486
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,831
We're done here.

487
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,711
Get the car.

488
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:40,152
He's cornered.
Counterflank and push him back to me.

489
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,912
Copy.

490
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,917
Freeze!

491
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:01,069
I've been waiting for this.

492
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,673
You're too late.

493
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,990
That hurts, doesn't it?

494
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,754
Jack.

495
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:30,276
Jack, what are you doing?
We still need him.

496
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:37,590
Go ahead. Kill me.

497
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,758
That won't stop the missile.

498
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:45,274
What are you talking about?

499
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:51,079
What are you talking about?

500
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:03,354
Jack, we got a problem.

501
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:07,115
- Better take a look at this.
- Secure the prisoner.

502
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:13,559
Oh, my God, they've got a missile.

503
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:17,713
Have you got your comm unit?
Patch it through. Tony, can you hear me?

504
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:20,553
- Yeah?
- I'm looking at a live feed of the warhead.

505
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:23,438
- It's on a missile.
- Missile? How can that be?

506
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:27,354
I don't know. We're trying to get
the feed over to you now. Hold on.

507
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:31,831
Once he does, lock it on.
All right, we got it. Coming up on the screen.

508
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,990
- Have you got it?
- Yeah.

509
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:36,389
How much time have we got?

510
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,198
51 seconds.

511
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,316
- Tony, can you see this?
- Yeah.

512
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,960
Can you get the source of the transmission?

513
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,679
Hang on a second.

514
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:49,513
No, it's on an encrypted uplink.
No way to trace it.

515
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:52,478
Do a geography scan,
see if you can pull a location.

516
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,757
Chloe, anything specific on the visual?

517
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:58,832
Looks like a forest area.
Trees, a structure...

518
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:01,434
- Tony, we're out of time.
We're trying.

519
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:04,080
We can't ID the location, it's too general.

520
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,674
Edgar, see if you can
pick up a heat signature.

521
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:09,035
I'll try, but it's a wide radius.

522
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,790
There won't be time to stop this.

523
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:14,394
Chloe, do you have anything?

524
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:19,793
I'm trying the four-band satellite,
but it's not working either.

525
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:53,191
