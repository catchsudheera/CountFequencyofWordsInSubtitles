1
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,839
- What's wrong?
- Keeler.

2
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,913
He's bringing your ex-husband into this
debate, the investigation into his company.

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,073
Then face Keeler's lie with the truth and
trust that the people can tell the difference.

4
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:28,793
<i>- What's going on? Where's Tony?
- He's been shot.</i>

5
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,269
- How bad?
- He was hit in the neck. He's alive.

6
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:34,511
They're getting him to the hospital.
You're in command.

7
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,558
<i> Deliver Ramón Salazar
to the Van Nuys Dam.</i>

8
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:41,030
Whoever sent this message is
controlling Singer's movements.

9
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,237
We have two hours to find him
before they release the virus.

10
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,676
- What are you into, Kyle?
- These cops came to my apartment,

11
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,833
saying something about using me
to bring some disease into the country.

12
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:52,909
A disease?

13
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,599
Go! Run!

14
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,718
No!

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,752
- You going to see Salazar?
- Yeah.

16
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:08,355
- Dad said questioning him is a waste of time.
- Sitting around here is a waste of time.

17
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:11,079
I need you to generate
a prisoner transfer document.

18
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,879
- What's this about?
- I need to move Ramón Salazar.

19
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,997
This has priority clearance.
No one at CTU's supposed to know.

20
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:21,198
Either I hand over Ramón Salazar,
or his brother will release the virus.

21
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,909
I understand that this is an impossible
choice. I have another option for you.

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,912
Ramón Salazar would be broken out
and delivered to him.

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,355
Sounds like quite a plan, Jack.
Who'll break Salazar out?

24
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,510
I will, sir.

25
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,239
This would be my last assignment.

26
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,675
If you play this cool
you're walking out of here now.

27
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,833
Open the cell blocks now.

28
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,473
Move!

29
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:01,390
Good evening to those on the East
Coast and good afternoon in the west.

30
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:05,109
Welcome to the first of three debates
between President Palmer

31
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,918
and Senator John Keeler.

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,151
We'll begin tonight with a two-minute
opening statement,

33
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,949
followed by the first question,
which will go to President Palmer,

34
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:18,591
this decided by a coin-flip
backstage just moments ago.

35
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,069
How you feeling?

36
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:24,311
Is that a medical question or a personal one?

37
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,312
- Both.
- I'm fine.

38
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,834
It'll be conducted
within the rules agreed to

39
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,117
by each member of the debate
and by the two campaigns.

40
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,634
Now we'll bring to the stage the candidates.

41
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,280
Ladies and gentlemen, Senator John Keeler.

42
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,280
I'm sorry you have to deal with
my ex-husband's lies.

43
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,670
It's all right.
We have the truth on our side.

44
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,513
Ladies and gentlemen,
President David Palmer.

45
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,550
Ladies and gentlemen,
Senator Keeler, good evening.

46
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,918
I'm looking forward to discussing
some of the critical issues...

47
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:01,119
OK... when I tell you to,
you start fighting with me over the gun.

48
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,634
I gotta pull two guards off the main corridor.

49
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,871
OK, come on.

50
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,794
Help! Help! Help!

51
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,953
<i> Now!</i>

52
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,272
That's enough! Enough!

53
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,715
Put on his uniform now.

54
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,710
I want a team at every security post.

55
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,268
Jack and Salazar are in east block.

56
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,796
- You partner's not my only problem.
- Warden, today he is.

57
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,758
He and Salazar need to be
contained and kept alive.

58
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:04,833
Want me to redeploy my men? I need
to know how real this terrorist threat is.

59
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,718
Salazar's brother will spread a virus into
the population unless we release him.

60
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,679
If we don't, the death toll will be
in the hundreds of thousands.

61
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:27,428
This is Mitchell. Tactical unit five, you are
now under the command of Agent Edmunds.

62
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,158
Thank you.

63
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,913
- Yeah?
- What the hell is going on over there?

64
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,878
- Jack's breaking Salazar out of prison.
- What?

65
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,238
He thinks he'll deliver him to Hector
and stop the virus from being released.

66
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,754
He's gonna get himself and Salazar killed.

67
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,992
I know, I know. I'm trying to protect him.
What about Kyle Singer?

68
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,231
- We're close to locating him.
- As soon as you do, call me.

69
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,392
If Jack knows we got the carrier
of the virus, he'll return Salazar.

70
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,072
Everyone is working on it.

71
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,994
- We'll find him.
- OK.

72
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,838
<i>Negro?</i>

73
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,111
I'm sorry, Linda.

74
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,311
Linda...

75
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,356
Am I gonna die?

76
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,071
It depends...

77
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,678
if they find us in time.

78
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,751
What do you mean?

79
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,998
The guy from the government.

80
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,755
He told my dad that I had
a couple more hours before I...

81
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,916
before I become contagious.

82
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,953
Maybe they'll find us by then.

83
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,031
You'll be OK.

84
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,675
Yeah... maybe.

85
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,031
- What are you doing?
- There must be some wires in here.

86
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,510
- What do you need wire for?
- Get you out of this.

87
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,200
Adam, look at this.
Got it from a Caltrans server.

88
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,475
Traffic camera right near the mall.

89
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,831
It's a blue shirt. Isn't that
what Kyle Singer was wearing?

90
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:07,230
Yeah. There's enough to enhance.
Release it to my screen.

91
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,231
Got it.

92
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,955
- Kim.
- Yes?

93
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,439
I need you a second.

94
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,351
- You got this?
- Yeah.

95
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,112
All right.

96
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,189
Something wrong?

97
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,430
Have you heard what's going on
at the prison?

98
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:24,593
No. Adam and I have been working
on finding Singer. Why? What is it?

99
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,989
- Your dad's trying to break out Salazar.
- What?

100
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:31,631
He's acting on his own authority.
He's trying to remove Salazar by force.

101
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,836
What you mean by "force"?

102
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,434
He started a prison riot to cover the escape.

103
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,988
- Why's he doing this?
- We're trying to figure that out.

104
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,992
- When did you last hear from him?
- About a half hour ago.

105
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,152
He asked me to issue a transfer order
for Ramón Salazar,

106
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,117
and he gave me a password.

107
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,189
And you did it?

108
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:53,115
Yeah, he said Salazar needed
to be moved. This isn't true?

109
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,589
No, Kim, I'm sorry. Your dad lied to you.

110
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,878
Why would he do that?

111
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:03,875
He knew if he asked anybody else, they
would know he was violating protocol.

112
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:10,357
- What's gonna happen to him?
- We're gonna try to find him.

113
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,238
The best way out of this
is to find Kyle Singer.

114
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:17,950
Then your dad will give up Salazar.
So go back to work. Help Adam.

115
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,190
Yeah, sure.

116
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,349
We're clear!

117
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,353
They'll funnel their forces
through one entrance.

118
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,431
There must be another way, Jack.

119
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:32,069
The prisoners have taken control.
We have to fight our way through.

120
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,471
Get ready.

121
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,309
<i> Pick him up! Come on!</i>

122
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,675
Come on, get 'em on their feet!

123
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,393
- Come on, let's go, let's go!
- Move, move!

124
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,516
Hold your fire!
We got hostages, so back off!

125
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,591
Hold your fire!

126
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,909
Come on, man.

127
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,431
Move! Let's go!

128
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,472
Move!

129
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,358
Move it, move it!

130
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:59,198
<i>... and in order to do this,
our reserves must be kept</i>

131
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,748
<i>and our fossil fuels must be conserved.</i>

132
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,750
- Did you send me that Kalman filter?
- What?

133
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:09,799
- I need it to clean up that image.
- Shoot, I forgot. It's in my outbox.

134
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,677
How can you forget?
It's all you're working on.

135
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,469
I'm sorry. Look, I'm sending it
to you right now. Done.

136
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:18,711
We need to find Kyle Singer
before he's contagious.

137
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,199
I'm doing the best I can.

138
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:23,078
"The best I can" isn't what we do.
It's done or it's not.

139
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,594
So why are you lecturing me?
It's in your system.

140
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,035
- Kaufman.
- Is there a problem?

141
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,953
I need to make sure
things are running smoothly.

142
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:46,354
I haven't had a chance to brief you, but
Jack's created a situation over at the prison.

143
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,352
- What situation?
- He started a riot to free Salazar.

144
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,556
They're caught up in the middle of it.

145
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,914
Whoa.

146
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,551
He used Kim to create a transfer order
that started it, so cut her a little slack.

147
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,753
Um... yeah, OK, I understand.

148
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:06,118
We're all under a lot of pressure, so
let's find Kyle Singer before it's too late.

149
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,555
Yeah, OK. Thanks, Michelle.

150
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,637
Kyle, what are you doing?
There's no way out of here!

151
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,320
You don't deserve what happened.

152
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,709
I do.

153
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,951
If I die, the virus is dyin' with me.

154
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,598
<i>Kyle!</i>

155
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,557
Kyle!

156
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,710
Put your feet on here!

157
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,590
Kyle!

158
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,358
Kyle, hold on.

159
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,556
Oh, Kyle.

160
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:33,195
A welcome-home party?

161
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,596
- You shouldn't be doing this.
- What are you talking about?

162
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:41,113
You've been running things.

163
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,192
Show Ramón you're going to be his partner.

164
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,156
Not his caterer.

165
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:51,028
Why do you care? You don't want
to be involved in my business.

166
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,874
No, Papi. I care about you.

167
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:58,077
And I want you to get what you've earned.

168
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,193
<i>- Yes?
- It's me. Riot's still going on.</i>

169
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,794
- But we know Ramón's alive.
- Yeah.

170
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,836
But Bauer's gotta get him out soon.

171
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:22,994
CTU's getting close to finding Singer.
If they do, they'll never let Ramón go.

172
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,640
- Then make sure they don't.
- I'm working on it.

173
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,994
Get it done.

174
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,831
That's him. That's Singer.

175
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,471
Is that a gun?

176
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,749
Yeah. Someone's got him.

177
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,878
We won't be able to get
the licence plate from the shot.

178
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:04,953
I'll get access to the traffic cameras.
See if we can find them again.

179
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,388
Michelle, we found Singer being driven
from the mall 47 minutes ago.

180
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,790
<i>- Are you working up a vehicle ID?
- As soon as we get another visual.</i>

181
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,030
- This camera's still functional.
- The hostages are on the right.

182
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:21,317
- Try and pan the camera over.
- They may see the camera move.

183
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,197
We have no choice. Do it.

184
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,671
There they are.

185
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,275
We gotta get in before they kill everyone.

186
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,395
Come on, faster! Faster!

187
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:45,749
Let's start wasting the guards
unless they let us walk.

188
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,957
First step outside - bam!
Headshot from a sniper.

189
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,155
You don't know that.

190
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,596
I know cos that's what went down in Chino!

191
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,911
They'll let the guards get wasted.
All they care about is keeping us in.

192
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,753
What the hell are we doing here, then?

193
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:07,317
Give me your gun.
Bring 'em over here.

194
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:13,114
We're gonna have a little fun with 'em.
Put 'em on their knees.

195
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,231
Who wants to live?

196
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,870
- OK.
- Do 'em all, dude. Do 'em all.

197
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,313
Let's try it again.

198
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,992
- Who wants to live?
- Me! I do.

199
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,870
Him. Over here.

200
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,951
Who else?

201
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,151
I've never seen you before.

202
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,231
I'm new here.

203
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,276
Him, over here.

204
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,996
One in six chance.

205
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,476
You're first.

206
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:37,192
Please... don't make me do this.

207
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,556
There's nothing to it.
Just put the gun to your head...

208
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,279
I can't. I can't.

209
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,990
You're gonna do it. You hear me?

210
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,310
Please... please...

211
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,038
It's easy. See?

212
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,431
All you gotta do is smile.

213
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,031
And pull the trigger.

214
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,235
Now it's one in five.

215
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,712
Let's go!

216
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,910
No! No!

217
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,753
<i> I can't. I can't.</i>

218
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:44,354
- This is a waste of my time. Shoot him!
- No, wait! Wait!

219
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:49,429
Come on, man. Just do it.

220
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,353
This way at least you got a chance, OK? Do it.

221
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,071
Come on.

222
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,069
You're gonna do it... or we will.

223
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,399
<i> Yeah! Yeah!</i>

224
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,630
We have a winner!

225
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:24,072
<i>Let's hear it for the new guy.</i>

226
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:38,196
<i>We're now seeing concrete results.</i>

227
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:41,511
<i>This is a road we will continue to travel.</i>

228
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,235
I got a shot from a camera
at the next intersection. The same truck.

229
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,912
Can you read the licence plate?

230
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,312
We won't be able to read anything
until it finishes downloading.

231
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,755
I just saw the IAD inquiry
come in over the system

232
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:59,274
about what your father's doing at the prison.

233
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,716
They're questioning the transfer order
you generated for him.

234
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,916
I heard.

235
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,438
If you want me to say you didn't know
he'd use it to break out Salazar, I will.

236
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,000
Thanks. I'll be OK.

237
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:19,154
Hold on. It stopped downloading.
I'm getting an error message.

238
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:24,836
Error 402. That means trouble
with an internal router.

239
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,358
Gael. What are you doing?

240
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:57,149
There's a problem with one
of the routers. I'm trying to fix it.

241
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:00,630
- Why don't you call a tech?
- No, it's OK.

242
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,438
I think I found the problem.

243
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:05,956
Protection circuit kicked in.
Must've been a line surge.

244
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,630
Should be up and running now.

245
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,028
- Let me know if you have more problems.
- I will.

246
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,158
<i> It's back up. What was it?</i>

247
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,789
I'm not sure. Is it possible a surge
could've knocked out a router?

248
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,872
Not from my side.
You could ask Chloe.

249
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,633
<i>Got it.</i>

250
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,472
<i>Hold on.</i>

251
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,630
<i>I've got a plate on the pickup.</i>

252
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,789
Where do you have it?

253
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:47,350
In the north quadrant
of Santa Fe Springs, driving west.

254
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:51,274
Put this out to mobile units.
I want everyone looking for this vehicle.

255
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,157
<i>OK, right.</i>

256
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,548
Ryan, I'm back.

257
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:59,633
<i>So, do you have any idea if Bauer is
trying to break out Salazar on his own</i>

258
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,438
<i>or if he's working with someone?</i>

259
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:05,718
<i>- I'll get back to you when I find out.
- You do that.</i>

260
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,278
<i>- Chloe.
- Yeah, Michelle?</i>

261
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:18,069
<i>- Know what's going on at the prison?
- What's happening?</i>

262
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:22,438
We don't have the details, but Jack's
behind it. Check his phone logs, email.

263
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,988
<i>See what case files he's accessed recently.</i>

264
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,354
What am I looking for?

265
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,715
Anything to help us know
why he's doing this.

266
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,872
<i>Are you sure?
You really want me snooping in his office?</i>

267
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,193
- Yes.
- You got it.

268
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,872
<i>- Surgery.
- This is Tony Almeida's wife, Michelle.</i>

269
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,872
<i>- How's he doing?
- I'll check. One moment, please.</i>

270
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,718
<i>- Mrs Almeida?
- Yeah?</i>

271
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:07,113
He's still in surgery. You'll be contacted
as soon as he's rolled into Recovery.

272
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,715
<i>- What room is he in?
- Operating room four.</i>

273
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,791
<i>- Thank you.
- You're welcome.</i>

274
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,116
<i>- Network op seven.
- It's Michelle.</i>

275
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,668
Do we get OR feeds from Good Samaritan?

276
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,751
<i>Let me check.</i>

277
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,471
<i>Yeah, they do. What do you need?</i>

278
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:32,872
<i>- See if they're video-docking OR four.
- Yeah, they are. Where do you want it?</i>

279
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,430
<i>- Send it to my desktop.
- All right. It'll take a second.</i>

280
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,235
<i>- There you go. Anything else?
- No.</i>

281
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,753
<i>Sure.</i>

282
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,550
- Four by four.
- More pressure.

283
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,949
- Can you hold that down?
- I've got it.

284
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,196
Got another clamp?

285
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,952
Clamp.

286
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:43,953
I'll ID the location for the explosives
once we get to the laundry room.

287
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,031
Your weapon, sir.

288
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,874
Sir, we're ready for you.

289
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:07,078
It's on. Monitor's up.
Should be seeing it on your eyepiece.

290
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,198
- It's working.
- OK.

291
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:17,954
Radio silence while we're in.
If they hear us, they might kill everyone.

292
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,397
Let's go.

293
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:31,992
All right! Round two!

294
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,640
<i> Yeah!</i>

295
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:41,434
- And you.
- I'm a prisoner, not a guard!

296
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,988
Ramón Salazar.
I'm sure you've heard of me.

297
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,878
Pick someone else.
He's telling the truth.

298
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,714
He transferred to this block less than
a week ago. I'm a federal agent.

299
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:55,112
I was escorting him out of the prison.
That's why you've never seen us before.

300
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:59,356
Good. Federal agent.

301
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:07,276
- What's your name?
- Jack Bauer.

302
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,952
All right! It's gonna be Agent Jack...

303
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,834
against Ramón Salazar!

304
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:19,754
<i>- A battle to the finish!
-  Yeah!</i>

305
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:43,191
Come on, Jack.
Show this foreigner how it's done.

306
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,510
If I die, my brother will find you.

307
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,716
Shut up and do it.

308
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:24,917
<i> Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it!</i>

309
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,116
Do it! Do it! Do it!

310
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,278
<i> Die! Die! Die! Die!</i>

311
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,790
All right, you're up.

312
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,997
Looks like you might lose the title, Jack.

313
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,591
<i> Do it! Do it! Do it!</i>

314
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,079
Ramón, stay down!

315
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,998
Ramón, come on.

316
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,711
All clear. Hold your fire.

317
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,997
Jack!

318
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,555
Jack!

319
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:11,359
<i> Senator Keeler would have
you believe that I have no triumphs</i>

320
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,079
<i>and only defeats.</i>

321
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,476
God.

322
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,558
<i>- Lab.
- This is Chloe O'Brian.</i>

323
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,474
I'm in Jack's office. Could you send
someone up with a drug kit, please?

324
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,516
<i>On his way.</i>

325
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:11,752
The differences on the issues are clear.

326
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:16,868
But I believe you don't elect a platform;
you elect the man.

327
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,520
I am troubled by some
of the personal choices

328
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,751
<i>that this president has made
and continues to make.</i>

329
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:28,039
<i>We're all aware of the allegations and
indictments surrounding his former wife.</i>

330
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:31,476
Most of us have operated
under the assumption

331
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,630
that he would not repeat his history

332
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:37,474
<i>of associating with persons
of questionable moral character.</i>

333
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:41,109
<i>However, my office has just learned</i>

334
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:46,593
<i>that the woman with whom the president
is currently involved, Dr Anne Packard,</i>

335
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:51,629
<i>is being accused of helping to fabricate
the results of a clinical drug trial,</i>

336
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:55,030
a drug which later led to the deaths
of three innocent people.

337
00:30:55,120 --> 00:31:00,513
This is outrageous. This debate is not
a court of law, nor is it a tabloid paper.

338
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:04,957
This is neither the time nor the place
to personally attack a private citizen.

339
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:09,750
Mr President, the senator still has
30 more seconds, sir. Please.

340
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,319
This is the right time.

341
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:14,790
I believe the choices your leaders make
in their own lives

342
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,156
reflect the choices that
they will make on your behalf.

343
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,310
And so the question remains:

344
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:24,678
Did the president know of these accusations
and choose to ignore them?

345
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:28,389
Or is he repeating past mistakes once again?

346
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,870
Mr President, your rebuttal.

347
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:40,350
I can tell you with complete confidence
that the senator's accusation is false

348
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:45,719
and that I believe it is the senator's way
of avoiding the issues at hand.

349
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:49,395
<i>I came here to discuss
the real issues pressing our country.</i>

350
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,674
Oh, God.

351
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:53,320
<i>- I assume that the senator...
- Now do you get it?</i>

352
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:57,996
<i> This is not something to be
swept under the rug and forgotten.</i>

353
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,071
It's positive.

354
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:21,315
I'll go tell Michelle.

355
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,595
What are you doing in my dad's office?

356
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:42,035
Michelle wanted me to go through his stuff.

357
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,439
Why?

358
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:46,876
To find anything that could help us
understand what he's doing.

359
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:51,476
Can a line surge shut down a router
on your side of the ITS room?

360
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:55,314
No, my circuit protectors are upstairs,
not in ITS. Why?

361
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:58,198
It's probably nothing. Hm.

362
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:04,558
- Did you find anything?
- I can't talk about this.

363
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,676
- Why not? Maybe I can help.
- You can't help, so just go, OK?

364
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,595
- What's in the box?
- Stuff I'm taking to Michelle.

365
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:16,831
This is really inappropriate behavior, Kim.

366
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:20,276
Why are you doing this?
I'm just trying to help you.

367
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:23,033
I don't have to have this conversation.

368
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:28,353
Field Op mandate regulation 40 or 41
says that I have jurisdictional prerogative.

369
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:33,992
- So could you just leave?
- Not until you tell me what's in the box.

370
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,510
I think your dad's been using drugs.

371
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,989
- What?
- That's right.

372
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:46,113
Rubber tourniquet... syringe.

373
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:49,795
We just had the vials tested for opiates.
It was positive.

374
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:52,110
And he's been acting really weird. OK?

375
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:08,159
It's really not fair that you made me do this.
This is very uncomfortable.

376
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:24,597
Michelle, I found nothing in Jack's records,
but there's something you need to see.

377
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:39,390
- This was in his office?
- I wanted to make sure what it was first.

378
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:43,314
The liquid in these vials tested positive
for opiates. Probably heroin.

379
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,391
I think Jack's a user.

380
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:52,239
A patrol car found the truck
Kyle Singer was in,

381
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,710
parked in an industrial complex
at Fuller and 4th, 2000 block.

382
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,756
Pipe this into the teams on stand-by.

383
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:01,958
Assume everyone on site is contagious
and use level-one CDC protocol.

384
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,553
Let's get him!

385
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:27,399
- Damn! Is there any other way out?
- No, we're pinned in.

386
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:31,314
You must have known this could happen.
What's the plan, Jack?

387
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:38,239
Give me the shotgun.

388
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,434
Give me the shotgun.

389
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,671
Take off your uniform.

390
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:03,513
<i> I have worked with my administration</i>

391
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:07,388
<i>on my overall economic plan.
The projections could not look better.</i>

392
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:10,709
Dessler.

393
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:15,351
<i>We're approaching the complex.
There are three warehouses on the property.</i>

394
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:18,034
I'll see if we can narrow it down with infrared.

395
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,435
<i>Kaufman.</i>

396
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:27,430
Adam, pull up infrared satellite
on the industrial complex.

397
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,158
On it.

398
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:31,390
Kim, log onto the NRT server.

399
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:34,392
We need to see if they have
any satellites in position.

400
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,956
- Kim.
- OK.

401
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:46,074
- What's the matter?
- Nothing. I'm fine.

402
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,916
Jack or Salazar aren't in the east block.

403
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,312
My team can't do a search until we
lock down. That could take a half hour.

404
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:16,390
You wanna get out of this? You have to
trust me and do everything that I tell you.

405
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:19,916
- You understand?
- All right.

406
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:20,989
Come on, let's go.

407
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:24,072
I want you to take that chopper
and sweep the perimeter.

408
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,196
<i> Chase!</i>

409
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,195
- What are you doing?
- Move these people back

410
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,033
or you'll have to take me out!
We need that chopper!

411
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:38,159
Don't do this. I spoke with Michelle.
We're close to getting Kyle Singer.

412
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:42,392
"Close" ain't gonna cut it this time!
I gotta deliver Salazar now!

413
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,232
I'm not letting you go, Jack!

414
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,278
How long is it gonna take you
to find Kyle Singer?

415
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,396
A half an hour? An hour?

416
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:55,237
I gotta get Salazar in that chopper in the next
60 seconds or 100,000 people will die!

417
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,999
- Let him go.
- Let him go?

418
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:19,392
Let him go. Track the chopper. I need
you to keep your people under control.

419
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:23,678
Please. I can't have anything
happen to Salazar.

420
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,390
All right.

421
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:34,359
This is Warden Mitchell.
I want all teams to stand down.

422
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:37,079
Agent Bauer will take Salazar
to the SWAT chopper.

423
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:40,072
All teams confirm the stand-down order.

424
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,276
Let him take the chopper.

425
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,351
Stand down.

426
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,392
All right? Back off.

427
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,679
All right, Jack.
No one will try and stop you.

428
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:54,069
Get this men to holster their weapons!

429
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:58,039
Back off! Stand down! Back off!

430
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,678
Let's move.

431
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:04,597
- Get them to holster their weapons!
- Holster your weapon!

432
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,716
- Lower your weapon!
- Stand down!

433
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,394
Get the snipers down off the roof!
Now! Now!

434
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:12,153
Get off the roof! Get off the roof!

435
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,959
Back off! Do what he says!

436
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:50,435
We have Singer plus one.
Central, we have Singer plus one.

437
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:06,914
- What's he doin'?
- Disabled the com and the locator.

438
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,069
Yeah?

439
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,116
It's Michelle. We have Kyle Singer.

440
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:18,510
- I can't hear you!
- We found Kyle Singer!

441
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:21,478
<i>- They found Kyle?
- Yes!</i>

442
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:26,953
Jack! Jack! We found Kyle Singer! Jack!

443
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:30,635
Jack! Jack! Jack!

444
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:47,554
...talk about facts and figures
all night, Mr President.

445
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:53,158
Once again, I see this as a question
of judgment and integrity.

446
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:59,188
You ignore this issue, an issue
of rectitude and foresightedness...

447
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:18,589
Congratulations. Now you are an even
bigger enemy to your country than I am.
