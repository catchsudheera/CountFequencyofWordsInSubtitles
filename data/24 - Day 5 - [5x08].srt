1
00:00:14,307 --> 00:00:18,302
You helped terrorists
acquire weaponised nerve gas!

2
00:00:18,389 --> 00:00:22,304
We were going to trigger the canisters
once they reached central Asia.

3
00:00:22,392 --> 00:00:27,866
Walt, you got into bed with them and they're
threatening to use the gas on US citizens.

4
00:00:27,954 --> 00:00:29,274
What do we do about Walt?

5
00:00:29,355 --> 00:00:32,315
Keep him out of sight long enough
to construct a narrative.

6
00:00:32,397 --> 00:00:34,354
Are you talking about a cover-up?

7
00:00:34,438 --> 00:00:38,912
Walt Cummings was complicit
in David Palmer's assassination.

8
00:00:39,001 --> 00:00:44,522
If we go public,
the credibility of this office will be destroyed.

9
00:00:44,804 --> 00:00:47,000
- Mr. President.
- What is it, Mike?

10
00:00:47,086 --> 00:00:48,804
- Come here.
- What's going on?

11
00:00:48,887 --> 00:00:51,004
Just come here, sir.

12
00:00:51,408 --> 00:00:53,525
- Lynn.
- What is it?

13
00:00:53,609 --> 00:00:55,966
I know you're busy, but I need to see you.

14
00:01:01,094 --> 00:01:05,611
I need you to do some work for us
and we need it done fast. Get the canisters.

15
00:01:05,696 --> 00:01:10,647
You have to cut precisely ten centimetres
from the bottom of the casing.

16
00:01:10,739 --> 00:01:13,892
- We need a place we can meet.
- I'll call you back.

17
00:01:14,822 --> 00:01:19,818
Logan asked for Jack to be reinstated
provisionally with full autonomy.

18
00:01:19,905 --> 00:01:22,897
We got a possible intercept on Erwich -
Jacob Rossler.

19
00:01:22,986 --> 00:01:26,742
<i>He's a software programmer
indicted for security code infiltration.</i>

20
00:01:26,828 --> 00:01:28,421
Copy that.

21
00:01:28,509 --> 00:01:30,262
Federal agent!

22
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:33,265
Rossler is in custody.
Repeat, Rossler is in custody.

23
00:01:33,712 --> 00:01:35,669
Answer it.

24
00:01:36,153 --> 00:01:38,714
- Yes.
- We have the identification keys.

25
00:01:40,876 --> 00:01:42,868
No! No!

26
00:01:42,958 --> 00:01:44,755
Is he gonna make it?

27
00:01:44,839 --> 00:01:47,274
No. He's dead.

28
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:50,000
He was our only link to those canisters.

29
00:01:50,082 --> 00:01:54,874
Erwich's gonna call here any minute
and he's gonna expect to talk to him.

30
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:25,373
- What's the situation?
- Rossler's dead, shot by his companion.

31
00:02:25,462 --> 00:02:30,493
- What does that do to our plan?
- We intended him to lead us to the Sentox.

32
00:02:30,585 --> 00:02:32,735
- How?
- He was gonna sell Erwich a chip

33
00:02:32,826 --> 00:02:35,546
that would enable him to release the Sentox.

34
00:02:35,628 --> 00:02:40,909
- And we put a tracker on the chip?
- Yes. Obviously that plan has to change.

35
00:02:40,991 --> 00:02:43,460
- Has Erwich set a place for the meeting?
- No.

36
00:02:43,552 --> 00:02:46,387
We've also picked up chatter
related to the canisters.

37
00:02:46,474 --> 00:02:51,790
- Related how?
- Erwich's put out feelers to terrorists here.

38
00:02:51,876 --> 00:02:55,507
He's asking for help launching
nerve gas attacks on larger targets.

39
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:59,514
There's a call coming in on Rossler's phone.
What do you want to do?

40
00:02:59,601 --> 00:03:01,798
Put it on the speaker.

41
00:03:05,405 --> 00:03:07,795
Jack, this has to be Erwich.

42
00:03:07,886 --> 00:03:11,437
- CTU's on the line.
- Ready?

43
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:16,400
- Yeah.
- Five minutes.

44
00:03:16,491 --> 00:03:20,533
The roof of the parking garage,
the corner of White Oak and Madison.

45
00:03:20,613 --> 00:03:24,244
One of my men will meet you.
Look for a blue van.

46
00:03:25,816 --> 00:03:28,935
- What do you think?
- I think we caught a break.

47
00:03:29,018 --> 00:03:31,249
Give me the chip.

48
00:03:35,182 --> 00:03:36,297
<i>CTU.</i>

49
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:39,854
<i>- Let me speak to Bill Buchanan.
- Jack Bauer on the line.</i>

50
00:03:39,944 --> 00:03:42,062
<i>- Buchanan.
- Did you get that?</i>

51
00:03:42,145 --> 00:03:44,900
Erwich is sending someone else.
That's a problem.

52
00:03:44,987 --> 00:03:50,508
No. It means I can pass myself off as Rossler.
We can keep the meeting. We can control this.

53
00:03:50,591 --> 00:03:52,981
Rossler and Erwich's man
may know each other.

54
00:03:53,071 --> 00:03:56,110
He wouldn't have said,
"Look for a blue van" if they did.

55
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:59,313
- It's a big risk, Jack.
- Jack, they will probably kill you.

56
00:03:59,395 --> 00:04:01,785
Even if they do think you're Rossler.

57
00:04:01,877 --> 00:04:07,830
We don't have a choice. If we're lucky, he'll
take the chip to Erwich and lead us to the gas.

58
00:04:11,282 --> 00:04:14,321
- All right, Jack. Do it.
- Thank you.

59
00:04:15,685 --> 00:04:20,477
Chloe, Edgar, Jack will need you to support
him through the installation of the chip.

60
00:04:20,567 --> 00:04:24,449
- We'll pull up the schematics.
- Already on it.

61
00:04:25,571 --> 00:04:29,121
The chip is genuine,
but it's useless without the unlock code.

62
00:04:29,212 --> 00:04:32,331
- The tracker is built into the chip itself.
- OK. Thanks.

63
00:04:32,415 --> 00:04:36,455
- How do you wanna play this?
- I want them to think I'm scared of them.

64
00:04:36,537 --> 00:04:38,688
Get tac teams ready. We're on the move.

65
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:43,491
You'll need a comm unit with a fresh battery.
You'll be patched into CTU at all times.

66
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:47,019
We'll be able to hear everything
within a 20ft radius of you.

67
00:04:47,103 --> 00:04:50,097
- I'll be watching your back.
- Thanks.

68
00:04:50,905 --> 00:04:53,374
Testing, one, two, three.

69
00:04:53,466 --> 00:04:58,749
He'll be waiting for you there.
Let me know if there's a problem.

70
00:05:02,232 --> 00:05:04,427
- Do we have the new chip yet?
- No.

71
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:07,028
I sent Polakov and Komar to meet Rossler.

72
00:05:07,114 --> 00:05:09,550
We should have it in a few minutes.
Anything?

73
00:05:09,636 --> 00:05:13,313
A remote is the most effective way
of triggering the canisters.

74
00:05:13,398 --> 00:05:16,437
I understand,
but what if the new chip doesn't work?

75
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:18,955
I need options in case Rossler fails us.

76
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:25,040
There may be a work-around, but someone
will have to be on site with the canister.

77
00:05:25,885 --> 00:05:27,877
Get it done.

78
00:05:32,328 --> 00:05:34,639
Excuse me, I thought you should know.

79
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:40,012
Walt's body has been moved to the Secret
Service outbuilding for the time being.

80
00:05:40,093 --> 00:05:44,532
You realise, sir, we still need to issue
a public statement about his death.

81
00:05:44,616 --> 00:05:48,975
- No statement till his wife's been notified.
- Of course.

82
00:05:49,058 --> 00:05:55,409
Sir, if you don't mind me saying,
I think perhaps we have an opportunity here.

83
00:05:55,502 --> 00:05:57,812
This statement you plan to release

84
00:05:57,903 --> 00:06:03,344
disclosing the fact that Walt was part of the
conspiracy to supply terrorists with nerve gas

85
00:06:03,427 --> 00:06:06,340
and that he was involved
in Palmer's assassination...

86
00:06:06,428 --> 00:06:09,182
- What's your point, Mike?
- I'm sorry, sir.

87
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:13,265
I wonder if his death
might render all that moot.

88
00:06:18,235 --> 00:06:19,635
Go on.

89
00:06:19,716 --> 00:06:22,710
Little will come
from dragging his name through the mud

90
00:06:22,798 --> 00:06:25,154
when he's not here to answer for what he did.

91
00:06:25,239 --> 00:06:29,200
And it would be devastating for this country,
particularly if, God forbid,

92
00:06:29,281 --> 00:06:32,275
that nerve gas is used against us.

93
00:06:32,363 --> 00:06:34,161
What are you suggesting?

94
00:06:34,244 --> 00:06:39,480
We could attribute Walt's suicide
to a despondency over the day's events.

95
00:06:39,567 --> 00:06:42,447
Overwork, personal issues.

96
00:06:42,529 --> 00:06:46,160
Let him go out with some dignity,
you mean, not as a traitor.

97
00:06:46,251 --> 00:06:47,844
Yes, sir.

98
00:06:50,973 --> 00:06:53,934
My wife will have
a considerable problem with that.

99
00:06:54,015 --> 00:06:55,928
Well...

100
00:06:56,016 --> 00:07:00,809
I respect the first lady's
moral conviction, but...

101
00:07:00,899 --> 00:07:02,937
this is your decision,

102
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:05,012
not hers.

103
00:07:18,309 --> 00:07:22,430
- Is there anything else I can get you?
- No, thank you, Evelyn. I'm fine.

104
00:07:22,511 --> 00:07:26,507
- Can I ask your advice on something?
- Of course.

105
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:32,267
Some of the staff are asking questions.

106
00:07:32,358 --> 00:07:34,793
- About?
- Walt Cummings' death.

107
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:38,430
I'm preparing a statement
that the president's gonna give later.

108
00:07:38,521 --> 00:07:40,911
It'll explain everything.

109
00:07:43,324 --> 00:07:46,159
- Is there something else, Evelyn?
- Yes.

110
00:07:48,326 --> 00:07:50,204
What? What is it?

111
00:07:50,288 --> 00:07:53,487
Why did he do it? Why did Walt kill himself?

112
00:07:56,131 --> 00:08:00,924
I deserve to know. A violent thing happened
to someone that I work with every day,

113
00:08:01,014 --> 00:08:03,449
who had no visible signs of depression.

114
00:08:03,535 --> 00:08:08,134
What if it wasn't suicide? What if we're
in danger? I don't know what to think.

115
00:08:08,218 --> 00:08:11,849
- It was suicide.
- How can you be so sure?

116
00:08:14,902 --> 00:08:17,098
Evelyn, listen to me.

117
00:08:19,504 --> 00:08:23,580
What I'm going to say to you has to stay
in this room until it's made public.

118
00:08:23,667 --> 00:08:26,741
You do understand?
His family doesn't know the truth yet.

119
00:08:26,829 --> 00:08:28,342
OK.

120
00:08:28,429 --> 00:08:31,104
- Walt Cummings was a traitor.
- What?

121
00:08:31,191 --> 00:08:33,308
I'm not gonna go into any details.

122
00:08:33,392 --> 00:08:36,944
Walt was responsible for some of
the awful things that happened.

123
00:08:37,034 --> 00:08:39,948
- I can't believe that.
- The president just found out.

124
00:08:40,037 --> 00:08:44,715
I suppose that Walt didn't want to face
the humiliation of a long public trial

125
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:47,395
and he decided to kill himself.

126
00:08:48,241 --> 00:08:50,915
Was he working with the terrorists?

127
00:08:51,003 --> 00:08:55,681
Our enforcement agencies
are trying to figure that out.

128
00:09:05,251 --> 00:09:09,485
- Jack's arrived at the rendezvous point.
- Maintain your distance.

129
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:23,499
Heads up. We have the blue van entering
the parking garage. Licence plate 6Q49951.

130
00:09:23,581 --> 00:09:27,577
<i>- Repeat, 6Q49951.
- Running the plates.</i>

131
00:09:34,788 --> 00:09:38,099
He's heading up the ramp towards you.
Couldn't get a visual.

132
00:09:42,952 --> 00:09:45,467
I have a hit.
The plates don't match the vehicle.

133
00:09:45,554 --> 00:09:50,027
<i>They probably stole the van
and put clean plates on it.</i>

134
00:10:00,482 --> 00:10:02,678
Two men are getting out.

135
00:10:05,045 --> 00:10:06,684
Showtime.

136
00:10:10,087 --> 00:10:12,205
Rossler.

137
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:15,086
I was told there'd only be one of you.

138
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:18,403
- Is that a problem?
- Yeah. I don't like surprises.

139
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:21,407
Relax. I've got your money.

140
00:10:22,294 --> 00:10:25,333
- Let me see it.
- When I see the chip.

141
00:10:34,982 --> 00:10:39,456
Erwich says you have to install it.
Where's the remote trigger?

142
00:10:39,545 --> 00:10:41,138
Let's go.

143
00:10:43,107 --> 00:10:45,099
Let's go.

144
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:56,625
OK, Jack. You need to remove the backing.

145
00:11:03,358 --> 00:11:07,400
Inside there are five jumpers.
Toggle the one in the middle to the left,

146
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,554
then pry out the old chip, but do it gently.

147
00:11:10,642 --> 00:11:13,842
When it's out, clear your throat or something.

148
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:26,604
OK. Insert the new chip into the slot.
Press the reset button directly under it.

149
00:11:26,691 --> 00:11:29,048
Screw the back on and you're done.

150
00:11:51,946 --> 00:11:54,746
It's reconfigured.
You can activate the canisters.

151
00:11:54,828 --> 00:12:00,701
You'd better hope it works.
You're coming with us, just to make sure.

152
00:12:03,153 --> 00:12:05,189
What are they doing?

153
00:12:09,796 --> 00:12:11,993
We're on the move.

154
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,196
<i>This isn't the deal I made with Erwich.</i>

155
00:12:19,282 --> 00:12:25,121
I reconfigured the trigger.
You're supposed to just give me the money.

156
00:12:25,205 --> 00:12:28,244
<i>- Standing by to move in.
- Hold on, Curtis.</i>

157
00:12:28,327 --> 00:12:31,560
Erwich knows who Jack is.
He saw him. They'll kill him.

158
00:12:31,649 --> 00:12:34,245
When Jack gets close,
the tac teams will move in.

159
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:37,803
We need to move in now.
Make the terrorists tell us where Erwich is.

160
00:12:37,892 --> 00:12:42,685
Erwich will know something's wrong
and we'll lose him. This is our only shot.

161
00:12:42,775 --> 00:12:44,255
Bill!

162
00:12:56,463 --> 00:12:58,659
Are we letting them take Jack?

163
00:12:58,744 --> 00:13:03,582
Stand down. Take no action. Reassemble
the tac teams and mount a follow operation.

164
00:13:03,667 --> 00:13:06,137
<i>- All teams, stand by.
- Roger that.</i>

165
00:13:12,632 --> 00:13:17,345
Lynn's right. Whatever happens,
Jack can handle it. He has to.

166
00:13:35,165 --> 00:13:37,965
Come in.

167
00:13:38,047 --> 00:13:40,482
- Excuse me, Mrs. Logan.
- What is it?

168
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:44,404
- Here's the press release. I'm confused.
- About what?

169
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:48,532
It's not what you said. They're calling
Walt Cummings a hero, not a traitor.

170
00:13:48,613 --> 00:13:50,809
I don't believe this!

171
00:13:54,736 --> 00:13:57,127
Well, is CTU any closer?

172
00:13:57,217 --> 00:14:00,656
They hope their operation
will lead them to the canisters.

173
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:04,894
Hope is not good enough. We want results.
You need to make that clear to them.

174
00:14:04,982 --> 00:14:09,775
I believe they're doing everything
that can be done, sir.

175
00:14:10,585 --> 00:14:14,661
I just read the statement
you issued about Walt's death.

176
00:14:14,748 --> 00:14:20,064
"Stress due to overwork robbed this country
of one of its most dedicated public servants. "

177
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:24,066
"His work with this administration has... "

178
00:14:24,153 --> 00:14:26,384
You're covering everything up.

179
00:14:26,474 --> 00:14:29,309
- I'll wait outside.
- Don't go anywhere, Mike.

180
00:14:29,396 --> 00:14:31,911
Your fingerprints are all over this.

181
00:14:31,998 --> 00:14:34,388
Charles, we worked on this together.

182
00:14:34,479 --> 00:14:39,795
I thought we agreed you needed to go public
about Walt's involvement with everything.

183
00:14:39,883 --> 00:14:44,561
I know you're disappointed, but it's obvious
Walt taking his own life changes things.

184
00:14:44,645 --> 00:14:47,319
What's obvious is that this is a pack of lies!

185
00:14:47,407 --> 00:14:50,957
Mrs. Logan, full disclosure
would have been necessary

186
00:14:51,048 --> 00:14:53,723
to ensure Walt faced justice
for what he'd done.

187
00:14:53,810 --> 00:15:00,128
With his death making that a non-issue, it was
decided this course was best for his family.

188
00:15:00,213 --> 00:15:05,849
Oh, don't. You don't care about his family.
You decided that this was best for you.

189
00:15:05,937 --> 00:15:09,056
- But you are dead wrong...
- Martha, that's enough!

190
00:15:09,139 --> 00:15:13,054
I made my decision, and I am the president.

191
00:15:13,141 --> 00:15:15,976
Which means it's your job to tell the truth,

192
00:15:17,984 --> 00:15:20,453
even when it's ugly.

193
00:15:21,786 --> 00:15:24,221
And if you don't, I will.

194
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:29,182
If you feel so strongly about telling the truth,
start with Walt's wife when she arrives.

195
00:15:29,271 --> 00:15:32,184
- Suzanne's coming?
- To collect her husband's body.

196
00:15:32,272 --> 00:15:35,869
So you can tell her that the real reason
Walt took the coward's way out

197
00:15:35,954 --> 00:15:41,156
was because he disgraced himself
and he betrayed his country.

198
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:46,360
All right.

199
00:15:46,441 --> 00:15:48,717
It will be very painful,

200
00:15:48,801 --> 00:15:51,522
but it's the right thing to do.

201
00:15:57,367 --> 00:16:00,998
We're one mile behind Jack, heading west
on Nordhoff, passing Sepulveda.

202
00:16:01,089 --> 00:16:04,527
Maintain your distance.
We've got them on satellite.

203
00:16:04,611 --> 00:16:07,810
Where are we going?
- What does it matter?

204
00:16:07,892 --> 00:16:10,408
I have another appointment.

205
00:16:10,494 --> 00:16:14,490
We're almost there. How long it takes
once we get there is up to you.

206
00:16:14,577 --> 00:16:16,648
- What do you mean?
- I told you.

207
00:16:16,738 --> 00:16:21,257
We need to make sure the remote trigger
works on the canisters.

208
00:16:24,061 --> 00:16:26,976
Oh, my God.
You've got one of the canisters with you.

209
00:16:27,064 --> 00:16:28,976
Erwich wants a field test.

210
00:16:29,065 --> 00:16:31,706
I won't be within 50 miles of that
when it goes off.

211
00:16:31,786 --> 00:16:34,382
We have masks.

212
00:16:35,949 --> 00:16:38,703
What's the target?

213
00:16:42,472 --> 00:16:46,673
- Curtis, are you reading this?
- Do you want me to reposition for intercept?

214
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:49,350
No. Not till we have a visual on the canister.

215
00:16:49,437 --> 00:16:55,515
If they stay on Nordhoff, up ahead there's
an industrial park and two retail complexes.

216
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:01,357
- They just turned north. That's not good.
- What is it? What's the potential target?

217
00:17:01,443 --> 00:17:03,958
Sunrise Hills Mall.

218
00:17:20,975 --> 00:17:24,253
Curtis, the intended target
is the Sunrise Hills Mall.

219
00:17:24,336 --> 00:17:28,013
Repeat, the intended target
is the Sunrise Hills Mall.

220
00:17:28,099 --> 00:17:31,491
Uploading schematics of the mall
and surrounding streets now.

221
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:36,817
Teams, stand by for positioning. We'll set up
on the second level of the parking structure.

222
00:17:46,869 --> 00:17:48,782
This is it.

223
00:17:58,997 --> 00:18:01,067
Curtis, do you have Jack on visual?

224
00:18:01,158 --> 00:18:03,673
He and the hostiles
are in the south parking lot.

225
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:06,228
Alpha team, take up position at the perimeter.

226
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,314
Bravo team,
I want plain-clothes agents at the mall doors.

227
00:18:11,484 --> 00:18:14,318
- How will you get the canister in?
- Through the door.

228
00:18:14,405 --> 00:18:18,036
Anyone asks,
we're working on the air conditioning.

229
00:18:18,127 --> 00:18:21,519
- I didn't agree to this. I'm not going in.
- Yes, you are.

230
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:24,366
What are we waiting for?

231
00:18:24,451 --> 00:18:29,368
There are hundreds of video cameras in there.
This entire country'll know what we look like.

232
00:18:29,454 --> 00:18:31,650
We want your leaders to know who did this.

233
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:36,607
That's your fight. The deal I made was to sell
the chip, not to get my face all over the news.

234
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:39,851
Erwich prefers to keep you alive,
but only if you cooperate.

235
00:18:39,939 --> 00:18:42,535
Now hand me the jackets.

236
00:18:44,062 --> 00:18:49,264
We're moving the tac teams in to recover
the canisters before you go inside the mall.

237
00:18:49,345 --> 00:18:52,180
Fine. Let's get this over with.

238
00:18:54,748 --> 00:18:57,662
<i>I'll let you know
as soon as we're in position.</i>

239
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:01,586
Sending redeployment orders now.
- Hold off on that.

240
00:19:01,672 --> 00:19:04,233
We have got to stop them
before they get inside.

241
00:19:04,314 --> 00:19:09,834
If we move in, Erwich will know we're onto
him. We won't be led to the other canisters.

242
00:19:11,278 --> 00:19:15,990
Are you talking about letting them do this?
Sacrificing the lives of all those people?

243
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:20,520
I'm accepting the damage that one canister
can do versus what the other 19 can do.

244
00:19:20,603 --> 00:19:24,723
- This is insane. Bill.
- Bill's not in charge here. I am.

245
00:19:27,607 --> 00:19:29,838
We need to call the president.

246
00:19:34,451 --> 00:19:36,443
Let's go.

247
00:20:04,068 --> 00:20:10,067
I just got into the mall's video surveillance
server. We should be able to see Jack.

248
00:20:23,879 --> 00:20:29,832
Jack, we're still waiting for the president to
call. I'll let you know as soon as we have him.

249
00:20:48,853 --> 00:20:52,370
Get the security guard. Knock on the glass.

250
00:21:04,423 --> 00:21:06,892
- What are you doing here?
- Servicing the HVAC.

251
00:21:06,984 --> 00:21:10,422
- We didn't get a call about that.
- I don't know what to say. We did.

252
00:21:10,506 --> 00:21:13,818
- You got paperwork?
- Just a minute.

253
00:21:25,994 --> 00:21:28,829
- Will this work?
- Yeah.

254
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:32,355
Do it. Throw me the bag.

255
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:35,591
And your jacket.

256
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,631
<i>The president is on line one.</i>

257
00:21:51,722 --> 00:21:53,633
<i>- Put him through.
- Yes, sir.</i>

258
00:21:53,723 --> 00:21:56,523
Jack, the president is on the line.
I'll patch you in.

259
00:21:56,604 --> 00:21:58,961
<i>- Go ahead.
- This is Lynn McGill.</i>

260
00:21:59,046 --> 00:22:04,442
You also have Bill Buchanan, Audrey Raines,
Chloe O'Brian and Edgar Stiles in the room.

261
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:07,568
We need your decision
on a critical operational matter.

262
00:22:07,651 --> 00:22:11,772
- What is it?
- Jack Bauer's undercover with the terrorists.

263
00:22:12,294 --> 00:22:16,369
They're expecting Jack to help them release
a canister of Sentox nerve gas

264
00:22:16,456 --> 00:22:19,449
in the Sunrise Hills shopping mall
where they are now.

265
00:22:19,538 --> 00:22:24,011
- Well, then, arrest them. What's the problem?
- If we don't maintain Jack's cover,

266
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:29,541
there's no guarantee that they'll lead us
back to the other 19 canisters.

267
00:22:29,624 --> 00:22:34,143
Do you mean actually let them release
the Sentox? Are you out of your mind?

268
00:22:34,226 --> 00:22:37,857
Mr. President, Bill Buchanan.
I had the same initial reaction.

269
00:22:37,948 --> 00:22:41,704
Then I looked at updated scenarios.
With the help of other terrorists,

270
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:46,025
the remaining canisters could be deployed
at other, more crowded public areas

271
00:22:46,113 --> 00:22:50,506
such as subway stations,
hospitals and sports arenas, sir.

272
00:22:50,596 --> 00:22:55,514
The loss of life could exceed
hundreds of thousands of people.

273
00:22:55,598 --> 00:22:57,830
My God.

274
00:23:08,125 --> 00:23:10,561
Bring it over here.

275
00:23:12,648 --> 00:23:14,640
I got it.

276
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:18,731
What kind of casualties
do you predict at the mall?

277
00:23:18,811 --> 00:23:24,253
We don't have exact numbers, but based on
our surveillance our guess is 800 or 900.

278
00:23:24,335 --> 00:23:26,804
Sir, many of them are children.

279
00:23:27,617 --> 00:23:31,214
- Can't you evacuate the mall?
- Not without the terrorists knowing.

280
00:23:31,299 --> 00:23:35,260
The public will not tolerate
the government's complicity in this.

281
00:23:35,341 --> 00:23:39,895
They wouldn't know, sir.
This would be a covert decision.

282
00:23:40,344 --> 00:23:44,624
<i>We're monitoring them. We know with 100%
certainty that when they leave the mall,</i>

283
00:23:44,707 --> 00:23:48,064
<i>they're going back to the remaining canisters.</i>

284
00:23:54,432 --> 00:23:57,231
- What's your recommendation?
- Bill and I agree.

285
00:23:57,314 --> 00:24:02,630
The greatest good would be served by
allowing them to release this single canister.

286
00:24:02,716 --> 00:24:06,553
I believe that we have no right
to sanction the deaths of innocent people.

287
00:24:06,639 --> 00:24:12,354
We should take our chances, interrogate them
and find the location of the other canisters.

288
00:24:16,125 --> 00:24:18,594
- Are we ready?
Almost.

289
00:24:21,848 --> 00:24:26,162
Mr. President, we're running out of time.
We need your decision, sir.

290
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:28,447
This is a field operation. It's up to you.

291
00:24:28,531 --> 00:24:31,286
With all due respect, Mr. President, it's not.

292
00:24:31,374 --> 00:24:35,927
We don't have the legal authority
to make this decision. Only you do.

293
00:24:38,257 --> 00:24:42,458
You're putting me in a terrible position.
Hold on.

294
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:45,413
Mike.

295
00:24:46,302 --> 00:24:49,296
CTU has laid out the facts well,

296
00:24:49,383 --> 00:24:52,502
but you have to make the call.

297
00:24:58,909 --> 00:25:02,984
All right. The terrorists are forcing us
to make a tragic choice.

298
00:25:04,432 --> 00:25:07,425
I'll go along with your assessment.
Let them release it.

299
00:25:07,514 --> 00:25:12,591
But you'd better find those other canisters,
or those people will have died in vain.

300
00:25:16,039 --> 00:25:21,116
Pull our tac teams out of the mall.
Jack, you heard the president's decision.

301
00:25:21,562 --> 00:25:24,123
- Let's go.
Put your masks on.

302
00:25:27,486 --> 00:25:29,955
I'm going to arm the valve.

303
00:25:32,608 --> 00:25:34,965
What's the unlock code?

304
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:38,328
Jack, the unlock code is Alpha, Kilo, Charlie.

305
00:25:38,852 --> 00:25:41,811
I repeat, Alpha, Kilo, Charlie.

306
00:25:42,534 --> 00:25:45,289
Come on! What's the unlock code?

307
00:25:45,375 --> 00:25:48,813
<i>Alpha, Kilo, Charlie, Jack.</i>

308
00:25:48,898 --> 00:25:51,015
Echo, Bravo, Charlie.

309
00:25:57,102 --> 00:26:01,256
<i>Enter the correct code, Jack.
That's an order.</i>

310
00:26:01,345 --> 00:26:04,065
Jack, this is a direct order from the president.

311
00:26:04,147 --> 00:26:07,697
Now, enter the correct code
and let them release the gas. Now!

312
00:26:07,788 --> 00:26:13,389
- It's not arming. Why isn't it working?
- Maybe the remote's been damaged.

313
00:26:13,472 --> 00:26:16,624
- Make it work or I'll kill you.
- There's nothing I can do.

314
00:26:16,714 --> 00:26:21,187
- Make it work!
- I told you, there's nothing I can do!

315
00:26:22,757 --> 00:26:25,114
Jack, can you hear me?

316
00:26:34,964 --> 00:26:37,240
- Yes?
- We can't arm the canisters.

317
00:26:37,326 --> 00:26:40,444
- What is the problem?
- Rossler says he doesn't know.

318
00:26:40,527 --> 00:26:44,887
- Do you believe him?
- I don't know. Should I kill him?

319
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:49,610
Not until we are sure
we have another way to release the gas.

320
00:26:49,693 --> 00:26:53,210
Andrei thinks he's discovered an alternative.
I'll put him on.

321
00:26:53,294 --> 00:26:55,491
Get him in the other room.

322
00:27:04,621 --> 00:27:06,135
Polakov.

323
00:27:06,222 --> 00:27:09,261
- The canister is in front of you?
Yeah.

324
00:27:09,344 --> 00:27:13,225
<i>- You have the mechanism?
Yeah, I have it right here.</i>

325
00:27:13,306 --> 00:27:17,506
<i>- Follow my instructions exactly.
OK, I understand.</i>

326
00:27:17,588 --> 00:27:21,185
<i>In the trigger mechanism
you'll see multicoloured wires.</i>

327
00:27:21,271 --> 00:27:22,260
OK.

328
00:27:22,351 --> 00:27:25,265
<i>- Splice each wire individually.
- What's going on?</i>

329
00:27:25,353 --> 00:27:27,914
Andrei may have a way to release the gas.

330
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:58,606
<i>- See the circuit configuration?
- I see it.</i>

331
00:27:58,692 --> 00:28:01,207
Now, move the jumper over.

332
00:28:03,174 --> 00:28:05,326
<i>Expose the red and yellow wire.</i>

333
00:28:05,416 --> 00:28:08,569
Hang on. I'm gonna put you on speakerphone.

334
00:28:09,618 --> 00:28:11,736
<i>Can the valve open without warning?</i>

335
00:28:11,819 --> 00:28:15,496
<i>If you make a mistake,
it could, so pay attention.</i>

336
00:28:15,582 --> 00:28:18,495
<i>- Five more splices to go.
Which one now?</i>

337
00:28:18,583 --> 00:28:23,945
<i>The orange wire is next
in the sequence. Exactly as before.</i>

338
00:28:24,026 --> 00:28:28,068
<i>The white and blue wires need to be
connected through the circuit board,</i>

339
00:28:28,149 --> 00:28:29,947
<i>then into the release valve.</i>

340
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:32,865
Get the masks. We're almost ready.

341
00:28:32,951 --> 00:28:35,547
<i>OK. Now you're ready to proceed.</i>

342
00:28:36,754 --> 00:28:40,112
<i>You'll see three inputs
on the bottom left of the circuit board.</i>

343
00:28:40,196 --> 00:28:42,552
<i>Three outputs on the top right.</i>

344
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:44,708
<i>They are marked input one...</i>

345
00:28:44,798 --> 00:28:48,270
There is still time to stop them
before they murder those people.

346
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:52,834
- We have a directive from the president.
- He signed these children's death warrant.

347
00:28:52,923 --> 00:28:56,520
More people could die
if these men don't lead us to the canisters.

348
00:28:56,605 --> 00:29:00,442
<i>They could. That's theoretical.
Those children will die in minutes.</i>

349
00:29:00,527 --> 00:29:03,202
- Look at them!
- Audrey, that's enough.

350
00:29:03,289 --> 00:29:06,203
If you were in Jack's shoes
would you follow that order?

351
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:08,886
Stand and watch
as they murder all those people?

352
00:29:08,972 --> 00:29:14,892
This is war. There will be casualties. If those
were the orders of the president, I'd have to.

353
00:29:16,176 --> 00:29:18,692
I hope that's not true.

354
00:29:19,979 --> 00:29:22,289
For your sake.

355
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:25,180
<i>You have two more wires to go.</i>

356
00:29:31,025 --> 00:29:33,096
All right. The wires are together.

357
00:29:33,186 --> 00:29:37,181
Put your mask on.
The next pair you splice will open the valve.

358
00:29:37,269 --> 00:29:39,830
Go kill Rossler.

359
00:30:08,326 --> 00:30:09,999
Polakov. Polakov!

360
00:30:10,687 --> 00:30:12,486
<i>Polakov!</i>

361
00:30:37,223 --> 00:30:39,738
Jack, can you hear me?

362
00:30:48,549 --> 00:30:50,906
What's happening? What's your status?

363
00:30:50,991 --> 00:30:53,950
I stopped the gas,
but some got into the ventilation.

364
00:30:54,032 --> 00:30:56,992
- Evacuate the mall.
- What about the terrorists?

365
00:30:57,074 --> 00:31:00,705
One's dead, one escaped.
Have Curtis's men start looking for him.

366
00:31:00,796 --> 00:31:05,714
- Curtis, this is Buchanan. Move in now.
- About time. Move in. All teams, move in.

367
00:31:08,881 --> 00:31:13,435
Up against the wall. Terrorists have released
a toxic substance into the ventilation system.

368
00:31:13,523 --> 00:31:15,959
You need to evacuate people now.

369
00:31:16,045 --> 00:31:19,357
This is not a joke.
This is not a robbery or a drill. Do it now!

370
00:31:19,447 --> 00:31:22,804
We have a red alert.
Begin evacuation procedures immediately.

371
00:31:22,889 --> 00:31:27,043
- Where's the power source for ventilation?
- It's next to the food court.

372
00:31:27,131 --> 00:31:28,929
Get everybody out now.

373
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:32,404
<i>...to the nearest mall exit
in an orderly fashion.</i>

374
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:44,574
- Curtis, it's Jack.
- We're closing in on the mall.

375
00:31:44,661 --> 00:31:49,180
I'll try and shut down the ventilation system.
I do not have a visual on the hostile.

376
00:31:49,264 --> 00:31:52,941
- Make sure your men take him alive.
- Understood.

377
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:49,850
Curtis, it's Jack. The Sentox nerve gas
that escaped has stayed in the food court.

378
00:32:49,939 --> 00:32:54,378
I got at least 11 people down.
I need assistance. I need assistance now.

379
00:32:54,461 --> 00:32:57,900
<i>- Got it.
- Sweetheart, can you hear me?</i>

380
00:32:57,983 --> 00:33:02,855
I want you to hold the mask to your face
when I take it off, OK?

381
00:33:10,791 --> 00:33:15,914
All right, masks on. Inject anyone who's down
and get them outside as soon as possible.

382
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:21,993
I need a shot of atropine for a child under 12.
Curtis, give me that jacket for her head.

383
00:33:26,119 --> 00:33:28,430
I'm losing her.

384
00:33:36,325 --> 00:33:38,921
Come on.

385
00:33:39,007 --> 00:33:41,477
She's responding. Her pulse is stabilising.

386
00:33:41,569 --> 00:33:45,200
We've secured the exits.
We don't have a visual on the terrorist.

387
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:49,491
If he got out of the mall
before we locked down, he may be lost.

388
00:33:49,573 --> 00:33:51,724
<i>He's our only chance of finding Erwich.</i>

389
00:33:51,814 --> 00:33:56,253
Monitor the tracking device in the remote
trigger. The hostile still had it on him.

390
00:33:56,337 --> 00:33:58,694
Chloe.

391
00:33:58,778 --> 00:34:03,172
Jack's right. The signal's moving away
from the mall. Looks like he's on foot.

392
00:34:03,261 --> 00:34:08,258
Michaels. Jack and I are going after
the remote trigger. You're in charge here.

393
00:34:08,343 --> 00:34:11,223
Walsh, gather your team. You're with us.

394
00:34:11,986 --> 00:34:16,904
Don't be scared. You're gonna be all right.
This man's gonna take care of you.

395
00:35:27,637 --> 00:35:30,517
Yes.

396
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:34,959
Rossler - or whoever he was -
killed Komar and tried to stop us.

397
00:35:35,041 --> 00:35:37,238
- What? Why?
- I don't know.

398
00:35:37,323 --> 00:35:43,322
I managed to activate the valve before I got
away. At least some of the gas was released.

399
00:35:44,607 --> 00:35:49,046
- You sure you're not being followed?
- Yes. What do you want me to do?

400
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:52,203
<i>- Come back here.
- I'll be there soon.</i>

401
00:35:58,175 --> 00:36:01,886
- He's turning left on Reese.
- We're six blocks out.

402
00:36:04,858 --> 00:36:09,298
<i>One moment, please, Mr. McGill.
I'll connect you with the president.</i>

403
00:36:09,381 --> 00:36:10,370
<i>Yes?</i>

404
00:36:10,461 --> 00:36:14,821
Mr. President, I thought it was important
to let you know what's happening.

405
00:36:14,904 --> 00:36:19,185
What's happening is I sent you over there
to make sure CTU was running smoothly

406
00:36:19,267 --> 00:36:21,259
and you seem to be incapable of that.

407
00:36:21,348 --> 00:36:25,138
- Bauer refused. There was nothing I could do.
- No, I don't want excuses.

408
00:36:25,231 --> 00:36:29,146
Just do your job, and if you can't do it
I'll find somebody else who can.

409
00:36:29,233 --> 00:36:32,591
The estimates from the mall are much lower
than we anticipated.

410
00:36:32,674 --> 00:36:37,273
It appears the fatalities will be limited
to between ten and 20 people.

411
00:36:37,357 --> 00:36:38,950
Thank God.

412
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:43,637
- So, what are we telling the media?
- Nothing yet.

413
00:36:43,721 --> 00:36:47,796
CTU is maintaining a blackout
until we give them direction on a cover story.

414
00:36:47,884 --> 00:36:50,445
What about the other 19 canisters?

415
00:36:50,524 --> 00:36:54,076
CTU has a terrorist
under surveillance as we speak.

416
00:36:54,167 --> 00:36:59,198
They believe there's a good chance he'll lead
them to Erwich and the other canisters.

417
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:01,122
All right. Good.

418
00:37:01,651 --> 00:37:06,808
There's something else, sir. Suzanne
Cummings has arrived to claim Walt's body.

419
00:37:07,574 --> 00:37:11,126
Martha is on her way to speak with her now.

420
00:37:12,617 --> 00:37:14,689
Thank you, Mike.

421
00:37:41,153 --> 00:37:42,952
Suzanne.

422
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,831
I can't believe he's gone.

423
00:37:55,922 --> 00:37:57,914
I'm sorry.

424
00:37:58,924 --> 00:38:00,722
I'm so, so sorry.

425
00:38:00,805 --> 00:38:04,595
- I should've been with him today.
- Don't do that.

426
00:38:04,687 --> 00:38:09,206
- I wanted to be.
- Honey, don't do that. Don't blame yourself.

427
00:38:09,289 --> 00:38:13,444
He... told me to stay at the hotel.

428
00:38:16,574 --> 00:38:18,851
You know how much we love you, honey.

429
00:38:18,935 --> 00:38:23,614
No matter what you need,
we'll always be here for you.

430
00:38:23,698 --> 00:38:28,411
I just don't understand.
This doesn't make any sense.

431
00:38:29,141 --> 00:38:32,055
You were with him today.

432
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:37,618
Why, Martha?
Why in the world would... Walt do this?

433
00:38:41,509 --> 00:38:43,501
Suzanne.

434
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:47,022
Walt...

435
00:38:50,233 --> 00:38:52,430
loved this country.

436
00:38:54,796 --> 00:38:57,072
And...

437
00:38:57,158 --> 00:38:59,548
he loved you.

438
00:39:08,163 --> 00:39:10,360
I'm sorry.

439
00:39:10,445 --> 00:39:12,801
I need a moment.

440
00:39:12,886 --> 00:39:15,276
Of course. All right.

441
00:39:44,064 --> 00:39:47,376
He's slowing down. He's stopping.

442
00:39:47,466 --> 00:39:50,027
Cross-referencing with the street grid.

443
00:39:50,108 --> 00:39:52,703
He's in front of 1136 East Muldower.

444
00:39:52,789 --> 00:39:57,343
Bill, we'll have to hit him hard and fast
to stop him from releasing any more Sentox.

445
00:39:57,431 --> 00:39:59,823
Agreed.

446
00:39:59,913 --> 00:40:02,508
Set up a perimeter. Begin your approach.

447
00:40:02,595 --> 00:40:07,797
- All right, all teams, we're moving in.
- Put your gas masks on.

448
00:40:39,175 --> 00:40:45,175
Team B, take the front entrance off
the street. We're taking the side. Go now. Go.

449
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:49,815
Yes.

450
00:40:49,902 --> 00:40:51,973
- You were followed.
- I don't know how.

451
00:40:52,063 --> 00:40:55,023
It doesn't matter. You know what to do.

452
00:40:55,505 --> 00:40:57,258
Yes.

453
00:40:59,267 --> 00:41:00,781
No!

454
00:41:00,868 --> 00:41:04,658
Hostile down. I repeat, hostile down.

455
00:41:07,232 --> 00:41:09,110
Air is clean.

456
00:41:09,193 --> 00:41:11,344
Curtis, have your men call in now.

457
00:41:11,434 --> 00:41:13,824
Team A, team B, report.

458
00:41:14,876 --> 00:41:17,870
<i>- What have you got?
- There's no one here. We're clear.</i>

459
00:41:17,958 --> 00:41:20,917
- The place is empty.
- Erwich and the canisters are gone.

460
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,152
We've got nothing here. Dammit!
