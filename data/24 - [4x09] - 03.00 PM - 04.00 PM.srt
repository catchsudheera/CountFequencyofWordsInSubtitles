1
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,759
The Americans have been able
to shut down most of the reactors.

2
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:21,277
I'll have to manage the override personally.
Make sure those six melt down on schedule.

3
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,839
Is there anything I can do?

4
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,478
Take care of your mess.

5
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,677
I give you my word. My wife and son
will be dead by the end of this day.

6
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,839
- I'm not afraid of Father.
- You should be.

7
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,878
He tried to kill me,
and then he did this to you.

8
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,954
You're going to need
to set things up on your end.

9
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,429
All right. What do I do?

10
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,670
<i>Divert suspicion. </i>

11
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,311
Someone inside CTU is leaking information
to someone on the outside.

12
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,557
<i> Ms Driscoll, what's going on?</i>

13
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,200
- You're under arrest, Gavin.
- For what?

14
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,477
You've been passing classified information.

15
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:00,830
Thousands of lives are at stake. Where
are the people who control the override?

16
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,309
I swear I don't know anything.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,036
- Yeah?
- <i> We've got a match, Jack. </i>

18
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,951
His name is Henry Powell.

19
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,077
<i>He was a computer consultant</i>
<i>for McLennan-Forster. </i>

20
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:14,789
They designed the device
controlling the power plants.

21
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,394
You're going to fly me out of here.

22
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,397
Drop the weapon now! Now!

23
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,756
Put him in the back.

24
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,758
He's dead, Jack.

25
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,910
Dammit!

26
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:38,118
You got the wrong one.
Sarah's not guilty.

27
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,430
It's Marianne Taylor.

28
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,469
You're under arrest.

29
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,998
- Excuse me, Curtis.
- Not now.

30
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,071
All right.

31
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,918
Coordinate that with NRC.
Copy me on six-zero-Baker. Fine.

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,639
- I warned you about her.
- What are you talking about?

33
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,755
Marianne Taylor.

34
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,912
I said she was trouble and it was
a mistake to let her work here.

35
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,673
You said you weren't
comfortable working with her.

36
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,832
You didn't say you were
having a relationship with a spy.

37
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,639
How could I have known?
Don't play that card with me.

38
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,632
Fine. Then don't have
an "I told you so" attitude.

39
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,234
- Now we both have to deal with this.
- Division?

40
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,550
That's right.

41
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,996
They're gonna want a timeline -
from how Marianne got in here,

42
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:51,076
down to the high-security files that she was
able to access in a very short period of time.

43
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,913
- Can we have a conversation off-book?
- Go ahead.

44
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,151
Neither of us should compromise
our authority with Division.

45
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,231
- Agree or disagree?
- Agreed.

46
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,511
Marianne did an excellent job
in establishing her credentials.

47
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:11,355
All we need to do is leave out some of the
details in how she managed to get in here.

48
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,908
I don't like anyone
holding something over me.

49
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,275
Neither do I.

50
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,918
How long will it take you to adjust the files?

51
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,195
Two minutes.

52
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,150
I'll call Division in five.

53
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:49,274
Explain to me how this mole, Marianne
Taylor, was able to infiltrate CTU.

54
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,999
- We're still investigating.
- Who does she work for?

55
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,957
- We don't know.
- Find out.

56
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,794
We will, as soon as she's conscious.
She's being treated here.

57
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,553
- <i>Treated for what?</i>
- An attempt on her life.

58
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,873
- Who tried to kill her?
- We don't know that either.

59
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:08,511
But whoever it was, they're more than likely
connected with the theft of the override.

60
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:12,275
Jim, we need to find that override now.
What's the latest from the NRC?

61
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:16,114
They reported the San Gabriel Island
reactor's about to go critical.

62
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,430
What's the time frame?

63
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,112
Meltdown within the hour.

64
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,555
<i>We're evacuating the San Gabriel zone. </i>

65
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:27,668
<i>The population affected is less than 100,000.</i>
<i>Hopefully, most are already on the move. </i>

66
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:31,309
All right. Expedite the process
as much as you can.

67
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,628
Yes, sir.

68
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,349
<i> Jack?</i>

69
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,716
Erin, Powell's dead. He was hit
by a sniper when we arrested him.

70
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,510
- <i>Get anything from him before he was killed?</i>
- No. But I got his last ten cellphone calls.

71
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,196
He called two numbers repeatedly.
We traced one of them to Marianne Taylor.

72
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,748
- Powell was working with Marianne?
- Apparently.

73
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,035
- What about this other number?
- Hold on.

74
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,271
- I'm gonna need you to trace it through CTU.
- OK. Go ahead.

75
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,114
818-555-0539.

76
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:09,194
- I'll get back to you as soon as I've got an ID.
- I'll be standing by.

77
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,309
Edgar?

78
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,676
I need you to run a locate on this number.

79
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,716
- It's a cellular account.
- Location?

80
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,028
- I need to ping the number.
- How?

81
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,680
It has to ring at least four times
for triangulation.

82
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,593
Jameson can have me set up
in a couple of minutes.

83
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,551
Who is it?
- Navi.

84
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,437
Navi?

85
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,710
- What are you doing here?
- Looking for Dina.

86
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,997
- Why would Dina be here?
- She hasn't called in the last hour?

87
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,274
No.

88
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,920
What's going on, Navi?

89
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,594
- Why are you blocking the door?
- I'm not.

90
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,910
Let me in.

91
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,833
- She's not here.
- You're lying. You're hiding her.

92
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:09,198
No, I'm not. Navi, no!
You have no right to come in here like this.

93
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,554
She is not here.

94
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,631
Look.

95
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:21,430
That is my bedroom.
You can't go in there!

96
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,755
- What's going on here?
- Nothing. It's OK.

97
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,115
Navi, please. Please go.

98
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,112
This is none of your business.
Why don't you hike it on out?

99
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,872
Please, don't interfere.

100
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:35,635
You can either walk out of here
or I'm gonna throw you out.

101
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:39,030
- I said go!
- No, Navi. Please, no!

102
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,519
Navi,

103
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,591
don't, please.

104
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,919
Get back inside.

105
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,549
Navi.

106
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:06,189
Don't tell my husband, I beg of you.

107
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,912
You disgust me.

108
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,797
Navi...

109
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,635
Dina's not here.
What about the hospitals?

110
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,359
- <i> Nothing so far. </i>
- Keep looking.

111
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,031
Is it your father?
- I can't tell.

112
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,031
Don't answer it.

113
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,068
- We got it.
- Where?

114
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,232
- A hotel in Chatsworth.
- Download the coordinates to Jack.

115
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,428
Here's the backup.

116
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,318
- Yeah.
- <i> We've traced the call. </i>

117
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,868
Hold on a second.

118
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:19,598
- I got it. We're less than ten minutes out.
- <i>I'll have a tactical team in place. </i>

119
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,238
Thank you.

120
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:24,392
The body's by my car.
He was taken out by a sniper from the roof.

121
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:28,792
I want you to take your photographs,
get the body back to CTU as fast as possible.

122
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:32,509
- Come on, Tony. We gotta go.
- Wait, Jack.

123
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:36,630
- Look, I think I'm done here today.
- What are you talking about?

124
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,598
CTU backup's here.
You don't need me any more.

125
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,069
I need you to see this through with me.

126
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,754
I appreciate that,
but you don't have to prop up my ego.

127
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,114
This isn't about you.

128
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:50,318
If we don't find the override device in
an hour, we'll have six nuclear disasters.

129
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,789
So please, get in the car. Let's go.

130
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,794
Mom, we've got to get you some help.

131
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,633
I'm OK.

132
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,070
I'm sorry. This is my fault.

133
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:33,597
Your father shot me, not you.

134
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,238
Because you were trying
to stop him from killing me.

135
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,198
Everything that's happening today,

136
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,874
what we've all been fighting to achieve,

137
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:49,316
it's more important to him than anything,

138
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,960
or anyone.

139
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,994
But not to you.

140
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,917
Mom?

141
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:14,716
- I need to get you something for the pain.
- I'll be fine. I just need to rest.

142
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,995
- I can get it from Naseem.
- No.

143
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:20,117
The hospital he works at is near here.
I'll be right back.

144
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:23,192
Naseem doesn't know
why we were really living here.

145
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:27,193
Mom, he's your brother.
I'll tell him you need it, and nothing else.

146
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,475
I promise. I'll be right back.

147
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,552
- Just hurry.
- I will.

148
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,271
Mr Secretary.

149
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,353
We have a meltdown. San Gabriel Island
reactor's just gone critical.

150
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,671
- Core material is now airborne.
- I thought we had more time.

151
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:57,276
Ms Driscoll, Derek Rosner, the engineer
at San Gabriel Island, is on with the NRC.

152
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,591
One of their generators exploded,
cooked their comm lines.

153
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:03,353
- We may only have a few seconds.
- Patch us in.

154
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,991
- What's going on?
- We've had a meltdown in San Gabriel Island.

155
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,830
<i>All attempts to contain the core failed. </i>

156
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,629
<i>We're trying to bypass the reactor trip,</i>
<i>but that's not working. </i>

157
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,554
Mr Rosner, this is Erin Driscoll from CTU.
Can you hear me?

158
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,709
<i>Yes, ma'am. </i>

159
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:23,793
Secretary of Defense James Heller is here.
What are your radiation levels?

160
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:27,111
<i>We're at... 500 REM right now. </i>

161
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,795
<i>That's ten thousand times</i>
<i>the dose of an x-ray. </i>

162
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,713
<i>At this REM rate the radiation will get stronger</i>

163
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:37,031
<i>and will spill into the atmosphere</i>
<i>until the core is exhausted. </i>

164
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,476
Son, you've done everything you can,
now get out of there.

165
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,313
<i>Evacuating won't make any difference, sir. </i>

166
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,039
<i>We've already been exposed. </i>

167
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,438
We've lost them.
Can we re-establish the link?

168
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,469
Have we analysed the cloud's movement?

169
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,074
We're waiting for NGS
to get a satellite refresh.

170
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,515
- Get on the phone, have them expedite.
- I will.

171
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,830
After rerouting evacuation instructions.

172
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,276
- Can't someone else do that?
- No. We're short of manpower.

173
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:26,990
<i>A government spokesman has confirmed</i>
<i>that the nuclear reactor at San Gabriel Island</i>

174
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,992
<i>is in full meltdown. </i>
<i>Emergency personnel are on site,</i>

175
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:34,790
<i>attempting to rescue</i>
<i>workers exposed to radiation. </i>

176
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,518
You're not listening.

177
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:40,149
I've been trying to get through to
the evacuation zone for ten minutes.

178
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,233
I need you to link me in to access
the emergency bandwidth. I need it now.

179
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,073
- <i> All right. Stand by. </i>
- Thank you.

180
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,754
<i> If you are on the road or awaiting... </i>

181
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:55,875
<i>... here are some items</i>
<i>you and your family might need. </i>

182
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,473
- Hello?
- <i> Mom. </i>

183
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,788
Hello, Edgar.

184
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,314
- Have you seen the news?
- I'm watching it now.

185
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,755
Why aren't you evacuated by now?

186
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,513
- You know I don't have a car.
- Where's Margaret?

187
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:10,229
I tried to get her but the lines are busy.
I'm surprised you got through.

188
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:15,314
- What about one of your neighbours?
- By the time I got outside they were all gone.

189
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:19,552
Listen to me. I'm gonna make some calls.
I'm gonna get someone there to help you.

190
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,313
I want you to sit and wait for my call.
Can you do that?

191
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,870
Yes. I don't really have a choice.

192
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,997
- I'll call you back. OK?
- OK, honey. Bye.

193
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,554
<i> We've delegated that</i>
<i>to Murphy's group. </i>

194
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:42,474
I'm not interested in that. We don't have
the luxury of miscommunications.

195
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:47,554
Someone from my office will coordinate
between state police and the National Guard.

196
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:51,713
Set up the conference call in ten minutes.
Thank you all.

197
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,558
- Are you OK?
- Yeah. How are you holding up?

198
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,438
Considering the situation we're in...

199
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,078
I'm doing fine.

200
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:12,280
The truth of the matter is... we do not have
the manpower to handle this mess.

201
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:16,638
- Tell me what I can do.
- I've prioritised evacuation protocol,

202
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:21,430
but I need someone to keep the state police
and the National Guard from interacting.

203
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,317
All right.

204
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:28,030
I'll stop the guard at the 75th-mile marker
and let the police take over from there.

205
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,714
We'll maximise room for civilian traffic.

206
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:35,191
I wish we had some other way
to get those people out of there.

207
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:38,317
There's nowhere else to route them.

208
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:43,836
Jack has got to find the override before
the rest of these reactors go critical.

209
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,080
Hey, Jack. Good to have
you in the field again.

210
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:02,072
- Thanks, Lee. You remember Tony Almeida?
- Yeah.

211
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,958
- I don't know what he's doing here.
- I want him here.

212
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,996
He's not authorised to be in the field.

213
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:11,995
I'm going through that door first.
I want him there to back me up.

214
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,957
Fine. Get another vest.

215
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,595
- You got a visual on the suspect?
- We got a fibreoptic camera inside.

216
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,911
The manager says there's
a midforties female and a teenage male.

217
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,434
Possibly mother and son.
Both Middle Eastern.

218
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,988
We need them alive.
They're no good to us dead.

219
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,877
- I've been briefed.
- Let's go.

220
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:41,390
We got a visual on the woman.
- What about the kid?

221
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,152
I haven't seen him yet.

222
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,231
We gotta go, now.

223
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,597
- You ready?
- Go.

224
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,115
Don't move. Drop your weapon!

225
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,912
Where is the override?
Tell me who's got it!

226
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,479
Tell me.

227
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,630
Now!

228
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,229
- Agent Castle!
- Stand down!

229
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,312
Lee, stand down!

230
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:30,435
- I'm gonna get her to talk.
- She'll go into shock before she does.

231
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:33,592
Agent Castle, step outside. Now!

232
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:39,078
I want her prints and photograph
send over to CTU immediately.

233
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:43,996
- He has no right to give me orders.
- Hey, come here.

234
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:47,072
He did the right thing.
She was willing to kill herself.

235
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:51,438
- She'd die before she gave in to force.
- We need to get her to talk now.

236
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:55,399
- And we will.
- What do you have in mind?

237
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:58,199
We need to find some leverage.

238
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:01,238
- <i>CTU, Hudson. </i>
- It's Jack. Put me through to Erin.

239
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,398
Come here. Come here.

240
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,916
Let me see your arm.

241
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,597
- Driscoll.
- <i>We have a suspect. </i>

242
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:13,672
I'm sending fingerprints and photographs.
Run a profile.

243
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,797
Send me all databases
and electronic communications.

244
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,677
- Got it.
- Thank you.

245
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,434
Hey,

246
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:26,629
I understand your concerns about Almeida,
but for me, please, just give him a break.

247
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,994
OK, Jack.

248
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,275
Jack?
- Thanks.

249
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,349
Yeah.

250
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,229
This is a bullet wound.

251
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,630
Probably a couple of hours old.

252
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:46,033
<i> The evacuation appears to be in</i>
<i>full swing, with delays on all routes. </i>

253
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:48,509
Excuse me.

254
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:52,388
<i>The nuclear emergency team</i>
<i>has just emerged from the plant. </i>

255
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,552
<i>We can see them here on our skycam. </i>

256
00:17:55,640 --> 00:18:00,794
<i>They seem to be going through some</i>
<i>kind of decontamination process here. </i>

257
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:05,510
<i>Their mission under these circumstances</i>
<i>is probably just to try and limit... </i>

258
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,039
- Behrooz.
- Uncle Naseem.

259
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,190
You all right?

260
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,793
Yeah, I think so.

261
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,156
It's a disaster. Everyone's panicked
about radiation poisoning.

262
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,993
They all want iodide pills.
Is that why you're here?

263
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,638
No.

264
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,950
I need pain medication.

265
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:27,556
It's for my mother. She couldn't reach her
doctor, so she wanted me to get it from you.

266
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,234
- What's wrong with her?
- It's her back.

267
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:36,270
- She needs a prescription.
- I told you, she couldn't reach her doctor.

268
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:39,875
I'll see what I can do, OK?
Just have a seat.

269
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,391
- Yes?
- <i>Navi, it's Naseem. </i>

270
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:07,359
- Hello. How are you?
- <i>Well. But Behrooz showed up at the hospital. </i>

271
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,398
- <i>He seems disturbed. </i>
- Is Dina there too?

272
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:15,600
No. He says he needs pain medication for her,
but he's acting very strange.

273
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:18,114
I'm sorry you have to be involved in this.

274
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,954
- <i>Involved in what? What's going on?</i>
- Behrooz may be taking drugs.

275
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,600
- <i>It's been getting worse. </i>
- I'm sorry.

276
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,194
- Me too.
- What do you want me to do?

277
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:32,719
- Keep Behrooz there until I can come for him.
- How long will you be?

278
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,995
- Fifteen minutes.
- <i>I'll do my best. </i>

279
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:38,914
Please, Naseem,
don't let him leave until I get there.

280
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:06,039
<i>... congestion. The government is asking</i>
<i>people to remain calm and exit... </i>

281
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,395
Excuse me, Ms Raines. I'm Edgar Stiles.

282
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,869
- Sorry.
- We have a noncompliance problem.

283
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,758
25<i>%</i>/ of the evacuees
aren't going where they should,

284
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,673
and another 25<i>%</i>/ don't know
they're in the evac zone.

285
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:20,435
However you need to do it,
make sure it gets done.

286
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,439
- What is it?
- It's my mother.

287
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:31,753
She lives near San Gabriel Island. She's in
a wheelchair and missed her call to evacuate.

288
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,956
Maybe the National Guard can get her.

289
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:37,032
The area commander said
he couldn't spare anyone.

290
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:41,318
- I'm sorry, I'm not sure what I can do.
- Here's his number.

291
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,630
I thought that maybe if you called him...

292
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:49,955
Look, I hate asking for special treatment,
I wouldn't normally ask, but she's my mother.

293
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,913
- I can't make any promises.
- Just promise me you'll try, OK?

294
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,431
All right.

295
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:16,476
I want you to give her something for the pain
but make sure she stays lucid. Understand?

296
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,149
- Have you found out who she is yet?
- Yeah.

297
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,073
She is Dina Araz.
She emigrated to the US five years ago.

298
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:35,438
Became a citizen two years ago. Married to
Navi Araz, also a naturalised citizen.

299
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,308
Owns an electronics store in Carson.
They have one son, Behrooz, 17.

300
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:42,073
Junior at the local high.
No criminal records.

301
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:45,391
- Not on any watch lists?
- Must have slipped under the radar.

302
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:48,677
Send teams to the house and the store,
see what we can find.

303
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,637
- Yeah?
- Jack, it's Driscoll.

304
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,599
- <i>Homeland Security... </i>
- Hold on, Erin. I can barely hear you.

305
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:57,035
- Go ahead.
- After the attack this morning,

306
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,749
Homeland Security has been archiving
communications in the LA area.

307
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:03,673
They pulled up a call that
may explain how Dina got shot.

308
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:08,356
Erin, I'm gonna put you on speaker phone.
Hold on a second. You're on.

309
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:12,638
This conversation happened two hours ago,
between the mother and the son.

310
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,790
<i>He wants me dead because</i>
<i>I messed up with Debbie. </i>

311
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:19,192
<i> Behrooz, that's not possible. </i>
<i>Your father would never want to hurt you. </i>

312
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,113
<i>It's true. Tariq told me everything. </i>

313
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:25,988
- <i>He was lying. </i>
- <i>No, he wasn't. </i>

314
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:30,356
<i>Mom, I don't know what to do. </i>
<i>You have to help me. </i>

315
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,476
<i> Where are you now?</i>

316
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,757
<i>I'm near the Metrolink station</i>
<i>on Lassen in Chatsworth. </i>

317
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,035
- <i>Are you using Tariq's car?</i>
- <i>Yes. </i>

318
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:42,716
- <i>Hide it. I'll pick you up there in a half-hour. </i>
- <i>Hurry. </i>

319
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:46,391
That's it. Let me know the minute
you get something from her.

320
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,799
Yeah.

321
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,871
We got our leverage.

322
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,833
Lee.

323
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,475
How long have you been
planning this operation?

324
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,869
Two years?

325
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,393
Five years?

326
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,471
Ten?

327
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,240
All this planning for one day.

328
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:02,633
You do realise, if all the reactors melt down...
hundreds of thousands of people will die.

329
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,676
Every war has casualties.

330
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:09,072
These people don't know about your war.
These people are innocent.

331
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,628
No one is innocent.

332
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,597
You really believe that?

333
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:18,595
As strongly as you believe
in what you believe.

334
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:24,357
So I won't waste your time or mine trying to
explain something you can never understand.

335
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,477
Maybe I understand more than you think.

336
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:33,154
I doubt it.

337
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:37,995
I know that something happened today
to challenge your commitment to your war.

338
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:41,550
You weren't willing to let
your son become a casualty.

339
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:46,430
That's why you were shot.
Protecting him from his father.

340
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,431
I understand that.

341
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:59,752
I know what it's like

342
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,673
to watch your child be threatened

343
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:06,309
and feel helpless to do anything about it.

344
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:12,230
Right now Behrooz is out there alone.

345
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,278
And you and I know
he's not going to last very long.

346
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,669
His father will find him...

347
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,908
then kill him.

348
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,560
There is another option.

349
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:37,313
If you were to help us
find the override device,

350
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:41,234
we <i>will</i> protect your son.

351
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,959
So he can spend
the rest of his life in prison?

352
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:47,237
No. So he can walk away from this
immune from prosecution.

353
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,914
- How?
- Mrs Araz, your son is a minor.

354
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,673
He's 17 years old.

355
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:57,675
I can get him a legal and binding pardon
signed by the President of the United States.

356
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,639
You don't have the authority to do this.

357
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,950
I can reach the president.

358
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:09,794
If you provide us with the information that
allows us to find the override device in time,

359
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:13,555
I am confident that the president
will sign that pardon.

360
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:19,636
This offer expires the second another
reactor melts down. Do you understand me?

361
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:26,438
You don't have a lot of time.
I would think about this.

362
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,999
Show me this document,

363
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:34,119
and I'll help you find what you want.

364
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,312
Can we rule out this boy's
involvement with the terrorists?

365
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:58,836
No. It's likely he knew of his parents' plans
and that he helped them.

366
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:01,832
You're asking me
to grant clemency to a terrorist.

367
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,275
Mr President, I don't think we have a choice.

368
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:08,069
In all of my experience, I believe
that we have to give in to her demands.

369
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,720
- Have you tried negotiating?
- We don't have time.

370
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:14,998
In two hours, five reactors will go critical
unless we find the override device.

371
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:17,071
<i>She is our only link. </i>

372
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:21,957
I'm uncomfortable with this,
but I trust your judgment.

373
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,951
<i>I'll release the letter. </i>

374
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,600
Thank you, Mr President.

375
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,829
Make sure that document is nonbinding.

376
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:38,752
Yes, I understand. I'll get back to you
on the redeployment figures.

377
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,193
Ms Raines?

378
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,669
- Did you talk to them?
- Yes.

379
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:48,716
- I'm sorry, they can't get your mother.
- Why not? They're five miles off the highway.

380
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,916
- They know where she is.
- What's the problem?

381
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,199
Thousands of people are stuck. It's taking the
police and the National Guard to move them.

382
00:27:56,280 --> 00:28:00,751
- So, who cares about one old woman?
- They have to save the most number of lives.

383
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:06,392
If my mother were rich or a politician,
they'd find a way to save her.

384
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,999
<i> Communications. </i>

385
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:27,311
I need another switching station
to that number. Do you need it?

386
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:31,393
- <i>No, I've got it logged. Hold the line. </i>
- Thank you.

387
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,636
- <i>Go ahead, please. </i>
- Mom.

388
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:40,952
- Hello, honey.
- I can't get anyone out there to help you.

389
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:44,271
- <i>I've done everything I could. I did. </i>
- I'm sure you did.

390
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,836
- <i>It's OK.</i>
- It's not OK.

391
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:49,718
The fallout's coming towards you.
It's 15 miles away.

392
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,951
I know. I'm watching it on the news.

393
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,713
And... I know what to do.

394
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:59,190
There's nothing you can do.
You can't stuff towels under the door.

395
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:02,955
- That's not what I'm talking about doing.
- What do you mean?

396
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:06,793
They talked about radiation poisoning.

397
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,474
That's not something I want to go through.

398
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:13,075
Especially since there's
only one way it can end.

399
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,798
Honey,

400
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,156
I want to end things on my terms,

401
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,152
as opposed to all that pain and suffering.

402
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,309
Mom...

403
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:26,393
It's the right thing to do.
It's the only thing, you know that.

404
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,835
No, I don't.

405
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,480
You have been a wonderful son, Edgar.

406
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:34,791
<i>You've been a gift to me and your father. </i>

407
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,555
<i>It's OK. I'm going to a better place, and... </i>

408
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:42,030
I'll see you there.
But not for a long time.

409
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:45,476
You've got a lot ahead of you, great things.

410
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,596
Maybe I can get someone to you.

411
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:50,513
<i>You've got a very important job to do there. </i>

412
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,795
A lot of people are counting on you.

413
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,797
So...

414
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,479
I'm gonna hang up now.

415
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:05,873
And I want you to know
how very very much I love you.

416
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:08,076
Mom...

417
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,477
Ma?

418
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:36,315
Edgar, where are you going?

419
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,389
Edgar?

420
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,675
- I have to get out of here.
- What?

421
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,752
My mother lives next to
the San Gabriel Island plant.

422
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,149
She wasn't able to evacuate in time.

423
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:48,630
We have five other reactors that
are on the verge of melting down.

424
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,359
- I need you at your station.
- I don't care.

425
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:55,752
You better start caring. You have a choice -
obey orders or end up in a jail cell.

426
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,354
You'll arrest me for
saving my mother's life?

427
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:03,036
If what you're saying is true, there's
nothing you can do for your mother.

428
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,918
But there are thousands of others
who you can save.

429
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:12,348
If your mother were here, what would make
her proud? What would she want you do to?

430
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:21,116
- She'd want me to help.
- Then don't you think you should?

431
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:41,870
We're ready to go.
We're just setting up a comm line.

432
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:48,238
This is a pardon for your son
signed by the president.

433
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,629
- This is acceptable.
- Where is he?

434
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:54,076
He is at Lindauer Memorial Hospital.
It's not far.

435
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,469
Set up a perimeter around Lindauer Memorial.

436
00:31:56,560 --> 00:32:01,031
I want you to call him, tell him we're coming
to pick him up. Give her the phone.

437
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:06,278
We have to record the call.

438
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:19,395
- Hello?
- It's me. Where are you?

439
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:23,029
Waiting for Naseem.
I don't know why he's taking so long.

440
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:26,590
Don't worry about that now.
Things have changed.

441
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:29,513
- What do you mean?
- Listen carefully, Behrooz.

442
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:34,435
Government agents found me.
I'm with them now.

443
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:37,080
Behrooz, they know everything.

444
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,754
Behrooz, just a few more minutes, OK?

445
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,596
But it's all right.

446
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:45,399
Everything is going to be all right.

447
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:49,230
- I made a deal.
- What are you talking about?

448
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,072
You're going to be OK.

449
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:56,031
You won't be arrested,
or even named in any of this.

450
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:58,350
I don't understand.

451
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:02,473
I'm going to help them stop your father.

452
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,157
You are?

453
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,992
Yes.

454
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:12,753
You said that I would be OK.
But what about you?

455
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:19,992
We'll talk about that later. Right now
these men are coming to pick you up.

456
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:23,231
I want you to go with them.

457
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:26,790
- Are they making you say this?
- No.

458
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:33,636
I don't know who these people are. I want to
be sure they're not forcing you to say this.

459
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,870
I'll come with them.

460
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:38,633
You'll know when you see me. OK?

461
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,518
- I'll meet you outside.
- No.

462
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,592
Tell him to go to the emergency room,
where it's crowded.

463
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:47,558
- Did you hear that?
- Yes.

464
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:50,518
I'll see you in a few minutes, Behrooz.

465
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,874
OK.

466
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:56,998
We're transferring the suspect.
I want to set up a protective cordon now.

467
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:59,036
Let's go.

468
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,597
Uncle Naseem,

469
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:16,910
I have to go.

470
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,991
What about the pain medication?

471
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:23,551
My mom's gonna get it from somewhere else,
but thanks for trying.

472
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:24,959
Behrooz.

473
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,871
- I can't let you go.
- Why not?

474
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,428
- I spoke to your father.
- What?

475
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:35,832
- He told me you need help.
- You don't know what you're talking about.

476
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:40,189
- I gave your father my word.
- My father is a terrorist.

477
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,191
- Stop talking crazy.
- I swear.

478
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,396
- You're talking nonsense.
- I'm not.

479
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,711
He's behind the kidnapping
and the reactors melting down.

480
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:52,351
We're all involved, my mother and me.
We've killed people.

481
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:56,319
Your father will be furious when he hears this.

482
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,511
My father's coming here?

483
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,072
No!

484
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,718
Behrooz!

485
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:42,916
I tried to stop him.

486
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:10,314
You broke my heart, Behrooz.

487
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,673
You broke my heart.

488
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:17,230
If you kill me,
Mother will tell them everything.

489
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,991
- Tell who?
- The police. She's with them.

490
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,877
- I don't believe you.
- It's true.

491
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:25,953
She wants me to be safe. If you kill me,
she will ruin everything you're doing.

492
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:30,556
If you don't believe me look outside.
They're coming to pick me up.

493
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,791
- Help!
- Shut up.

494
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:58,234
- Tony, did you notify Security?
- No.

495
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:01,392
Something is wrong.

496
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:04,040
Set up a level-three cordon
around the hospital.

497
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:06,429
- I'm going with you.
- No, you're not.

498
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:21,191
- What's going on?
- A pharmacist has been shot. Who are you?

499
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:25,398
Jack Bauer. I work with CTU. We've
been tracking the shooter. Where is he?

500
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:28,677
Someone radioed in from C Wing.
A Middle Eastern man has a hostage.

501
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,751
- A 17-year-old boy?
- I think so.

502
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,398
What are the possible exits?

503
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,711
He'll end up in the east parking garage.
We got men heading there.

504
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:40,954
Tell your supervisor to tell his men to back
off. No one makes contact. Understand me?

505
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,349
Hang on a sec.

506
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,919
- Yeah?
- <i>It's Jack. </i>

507
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,434
Navi is here.
He's killed his wife's brother.

508
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,999
- What about the boy?
- I don't know.

509
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:51,719
Lock down exits.
He's headed for the parking garage.

510
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:54,234
Meet me on the east of
the building with backup.

511
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:57,710
Copy. We're going to the east of the building.
Backup teams there now.

512
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,713
- What happened?
- We're still looking for your son.

513
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:11,839
- There's more, tell me.
- Mrs Araz, we're gonna find your son.

514
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,751
I hate you.

515
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,592
I've always hated you,

516
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:28,355
and the only reason I never said so
was because I was afraid of you.

517
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:31,113
But I'm not afraid of you any more.

518
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,475
- Get in.
- Go to hell.

519
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,631
Get in!

520
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,988
We're in the garage.
We've secured the exit.

521
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:49,878
- I'm almost there. Can you get an ID?
- Nothing yet.

522
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,915
Let me see your hands!
Put your hands where I can see them, now!

523
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,150
- Careful!
Drop the gun!

524
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:21,550
- You'll hit the boy.
- Let the boy go!

525
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:26,475
We can work this out. I will put my gun down
if you give me the boy. All I want is the boy.

526
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,915
- Stay back!
- Put the gun down!

527
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,150
Put the gun... Tony, stop the car!

528
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,912
- Behrooz!
- Mom!

529
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,230
Keep her in the car.

530
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:40,117
That stairwell leads to the basement. He's got
to go down. Set up a link with CTU now!

531
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,191
Copy that. Call CTU, we need backup.

532
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,475
Mrs Araz, calm down.
We'll get your son.

533
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:09,750
We've uploaded the plans to you.
There are only three exits from the basement.

534
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:12,912
We've got all entrances and exits covered.
He's trapped.

535
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,436
- Let's try to open up a negotiation.
- My husband won't negotiate.

536
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,272
- Why's that?
- He doesn't need to.

537
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:22,433
He has to assume I have agreed to help you
in return for my son's safety.

538
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:25,114
- He can't stay down there forever.
- He won't.

539
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,953
In two hours, all the reactors
will have gone critical.

540
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:32,033
After that, it won't matter what I tell you,
and he can kill my son.

541
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:35,590
I am only helping you to save his life.

542
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,671
I believe in our cause,

543
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:44,313
and if you can't save my son,
I am happy to see the reactors melt down.

544
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,638
Did you get that?

545
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:16,312
