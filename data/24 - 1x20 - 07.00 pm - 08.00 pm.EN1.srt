1
00:00:13,293 --> 00:00:18,606
(Jack) Right now, terrorists are plotting
to assassinate a presidential candidate.

2
00:00:18,693 --> 00:00:21,082
My wife and daughter have been targeted.

3
00:00:21,173 --> 00:00:25,086
And people that l work with
may be involved in both.

4
00:00:25,173 --> 00:00:31,089
l'm Federal Agent Jack Bauer,
and today is the longest day of my life.

5
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:38,770
Last night l received a phone call regarding
my son, Keith, and my daughter, Nicole.

6
00:00:38,853 --> 00:00:43,881
That call has unfortunately set offa chain
ofevents that has culminated in a tragedy.

7
00:00:44,293 --> 00:00:49,048
(Phil) l'm your friend - you told me so yourself
- so you're gonna have to trust myjudgment.

8
00:00:52,973 --> 00:00:55,965
- Your daughter. Where is she?
- l don't know.

9
00:01:02,013 --> 00:01:04,402
- (Rick) Whatyou gonna do?
- (Frank) What do you think?

10
00:01:04,493 --> 00:01:06,927
You're gonna rip 'em off.

11
00:01:07,013 --> 00:01:10,972
- Where's the money?
- l got your money. All right, stand down!

12
00:01:11,053 --> 00:01:13,806
- What you gonna do now, man? Kill us?
- Yeah.

13
00:01:13,893 --> 00:01:16,453
You have the right to remain silent.

14
00:01:17,973 --> 00:01:19,326
(Kim screams)

15
00:01:19,733 --> 00:01:21,849
Arrest all of 'em.

16
00:01:22,213 --> 00:01:24,488
- (Mason) Where you headed?
- (Jack) Saugus.

17
00:01:24,573 --> 00:01:28,566
Alexis paid this guy to knock the power out
at a specific address. l wanna know why.

18
00:01:28,653 --> 00:01:32,771
Correct me if l'm wrong, but this day
basically boils down to a personal vendetta

19
00:01:32,853 --> 00:01:35,048
against you and Palmer by the Drazens.

20
00:01:35,133 --> 00:01:35,883
Yes.

21
00:01:35,973 --> 00:01:39,249
Any ideas on why the Serbs'd
wanna spend this much money

22
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:42,325
to turn the power off
in the middle of the woods?

23
00:01:43,973 --> 00:01:45,964
Someone knows we're here.

24
00:02:38,733 --> 00:02:41,691
Jack, l take back what l said.
lt's getting dull.

25
00:02:41,773 --> 00:02:46,164
- That helicopter made a flyby for a reason.
- Maybe, maybe not.

26
00:02:46,253 --> 00:02:48,813
Come here and help me with this.

27
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:52,403
One, two, three.

28
00:02:55,853 --> 00:02:58,447
There's nothin' here. We're wasting our time.

29
00:02:58,533 --> 00:03:04,403
Alexis tried to pay a power-company official
to cut off the electricity at 7.20 for a reason.

30
00:03:04,493 --> 00:03:07,053
There's something here that they want.

31
00:03:07,133 --> 00:03:09,124
(phone rings)

32
00:03:10,573 --> 00:03:12,165
Mason.

33
00:03:12,813 --> 00:03:18,410
Excellent news. Half an hour. OK,
don't let anyone in or out until we get there.

34
00:03:18,493 --> 00:03:21,724
Alexis Drazen just got out of surgery.
We ought to be there.

35
00:03:21,813 --> 00:03:26,284
- You go ahead.
- Jack, we were fed misinformation.

36
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:29,604
The address in the file, the time
Morgan gave you, the whole thing.

37
00:03:29,693 --> 00:03:33,049
- Look around. There's nothin' here. Nothin'.
- Maybe.

38
00:03:33,133 --> 00:03:36,284
But you're gonna stick around anyway.

39
00:03:36,373 --> 00:03:39,922
lt's three minutes after seven, George.
l wanna be here at 7.20.

40
00:03:41,413 --> 00:03:46,407
Look, you can send a car back for me, OK?
l promise l won't disappear on you.

41
00:03:46,493 --> 00:03:49,087
l don't have time to argue with you.

42
00:04:05,013 --> 00:04:07,208
Oh, my God!

43
00:04:07,293 --> 00:04:10,285
Stay right here. Stay right there, Teri.

44
00:04:13,293 --> 00:04:16,091
- Who the hell was that guy?
- l don't know.

45
00:04:19,773 --> 00:04:21,764
(Teri sobs)

46
00:04:23,493 --> 00:04:26,724
Teri? Teri, it's OK. l'm right here.

47
00:04:26,813 --> 00:04:28,565
lt's OK.

48
00:04:28,653 --> 00:04:30,928
Teri, listen to me, take a breath.

49
00:04:31,013 --> 00:04:33,652
l can't. l can't!

50
00:04:34,093 --> 00:04:37,642
l saw the car explode. There was nothing left!

51
00:04:37,733 --> 00:04:39,849
Hey. Hey! Kim is alive.

52
00:04:39,933 --> 00:04:42,925
She got out before the explosion.
l talked to her.

53
00:04:43,013 --> 00:04:45,243
She was fine. She was worried about you.

54
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:48,689
Now, l need your help.
l need to get you back to CTU. Come on.

55
00:04:48,773 --> 00:04:51,890
- Oh, my God.
- l need your help, Teri. Come on.

56
00:04:51,973 --> 00:04:55,010
What did she say?
What did she say when you talked to her?

57
00:04:55,093 --> 00:04:57,812
- Where is she?
- We don't know. She wouldn't tell us.

58
00:04:57,893 --> 00:05:00,965
After the safe house, she didn't trust us.
l don't blame her.

59
00:05:01,053 --> 00:05:06,605
- We have to find her! Tony, we have to...
- Believe me, we're looking. Get in the car!

60
00:05:15,853 --> 00:05:18,003
Where's Jack?
Does he know what's happening?

61
00:05:18,093 --> 00:05:22,484
He's out on an assignment.
l should hear from him soon, though.

62
00:05:22,573 --> 00:05:24,291
(dials phone)

63
00:05:24,373 --> 00:05:26,364
(phone rings)

64
00:05:29,533 --> 00:05:32,411
- Myers.
- lt's me. l found Teri at the Bauer house.

65
00:05:32,493 --> 00:05:37,408
Somebody tried to kill her, but l took him
down. Send a team in case he's got backup.

66
00:05:37,493 --> 00:05:39,370
- ls she all right?
- She will be.

67
00:05:39,453 --> 00:05:43,969
She seems to have suffered some temporary
memory loss. She's got a friend with her, too.

68
00:05:44,053 --> 00:05:48,410
- l guess a good one by the way he's acting.
- Wait. Are you sure? Who is this guy?

69
00:05:48,493 --> 00:05:52,691
His name's Phil Parslow. She vouches for
him. Apparently she's known him a long time.

70
00:05:52,773 --> 00:05:55,606
- He was hit, but not too badly.
- OK. Where are you now?

71
00:05:55,693 --> 00:05:57,365
20, 30 minutes away.

72
00:05:57,453 --> 00:06:01,128
Take him to the clinic. l'll send someone
to question him. Bring Teri here.

73
00:06:01,213 --> 00:06:02,805
OK.

74
00:06:09,493 --> 00:06:12,610
- (Kim) Don't l get a phone call?
- Lock 'em down. Come on.

75
00:06:12,693 --> 00:06:15,571
- Look, l need to talk to someone.
- Yeah, don't we all!

76
00:06:15,653 --> 00:06:18,486
Don't listen to the bitch. She lies.

77
00:06:18,573 --> 00:06:23,966
You're gonna get a chance for that after we
put you through. Come with me. You're mine.

78
00:06:36,853 --> 00:06:39,765
They're gonna ask you about Frank...
and the deal.

79
00:06:39,853 --> 00:06:41,764
l don't know about Frank or the deal.

80
00:06:41,853 --> 00:06:44,970
Tell 'em that. You were just
at the wrong place at the wrong time.

81
00:06:45,053 --> 00:06:49,285
l think l should tell them about everything
else, too. l mean, what happened today.

82
00:06:49,373 --> 00:06:53,605
After the safe house,
l'm not sure if l can trust anybody.

83
00:06:53,693 --> 00:06:57,402
- You trust me, right?
- Yeah, and look where it got me.

84
00:06:58,733 --> 00:07:01,930
Yes, l trust you, and l know
you're trying to do the right thing.

85
00:07:02,013 --> 00:07:05,210
OK, then listen to me. Tell 'em everything.

86
00:07:06,413 --> 00:07:09,849
What happened at the safe house
has nothin' to do with this.

87
00:07:09,933 --> 00:07:14,131
Whatever you tell them, l'll back it up.
lncluding my part in it.

88
00:07:17,693 --> 00:07:20,651
- You're gonna get in trouble.
- Then l'll get in trouble.

89
00:07:20,733 --> 00:07:23,452
lt's about time l faced up to what l did.

90
00:07:24,373 --> 00:07:26,125
All right.

91
00:07:26,933 --> 00:07:28,924
You're up.

92
00:08:13,533 --> 00:08:15,922
How are you feelin'?

93
00:08:16,013 --> 00:08:18,004
l'm fine, Daddy.

94
00:08:18,533 --> 00:08:20,524
Relieved, actually.

95
00:08:21,733 --> 00:08:26,568
l think that maybe... living with a secret
is harder work than l thought.

96
00:08:29,293 --> 00:08:32,251
l'd be lying to you if l told you
the hard work was over.

97
00:08:34,053 --> 00:08:39,286
You're gonna be asked some questions -
we all are - that we'd rather not deal with.

98
00:08:39,373 --> 00:08:43,366
But if we stick together, we'll get through it.

99
00:08:44,773 --> 00:08:46,764
(door opens)

100
00:09:01,133 --> 00:09:04,330
Would you give your mother
and me a few minutes?

101
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:28,724
l'm sorry.

102
00:09:30,293 --> 00:09:32,090
l, uh...

103
00:09:32,733 --> 00:09:36,612
didn't mean to interrupt your... celebration.

104
00:09:39,173 --> 00:09:41,209
You could've joined it.

105
00:09:41,293 --> 00:09:46,162
Well, l'm not in the mood to celebrate
the end of your campaign, David.

106
00:09:48,973 --> 00:09:53,285
- You just gave your concession speech.
- That remains to be seen.

107
00:09:55,453 --> 00:09:58,092
Do you really think people want a president

108
00:09:58,173 --> 00:10:04,772
who acts like some guest on a bad afternoon
talk show, confessing his sins publicly?

109
00:10:04,853 --> 00:10:08,926
lt's always possible
that they want someone honest.

110
00:10:10,213 --> 00:10:15,845
- Mike seems to think l still have a shot.
- lt's his job to tell you what you wanna hear.

111
00:10:15,933 --> 00:10:19,084
Mine... is to tell you the truth.

112
00:10:19,173 --> 00:10:22,165
You're not qualified to tell me the truth.

113
00:10:24,733 --> 00:10:31,206
lt took 13 minutes for you to tear apart
everything that it took us 25 years to build.

114
00:10:31,293 --> 00:10:34,330
Why don't you just let me
mourn that loss, OK?

115
00:10:34,733 --> 00:10:36,724
Fair enough.

116
00:10:41,573 --> 00:10:46,044
l only hope your conscience comforts you
when you finally realise this is all over.

117
00:10:46,133 --> 00:10:48,124
You mean the campaign or us?

118
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:27,122
- Confirm, Alpha One.
- This is Alpha One.

119
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:30,888
- Bauer's gone below.
- Positive it was Bauer?

120
00:12:30,973 --> 00:12:32,565
Yes.

121
00:12:33,453 --> 00:12:37,446
- What's he doing here?
- He wasn't invited, that's for sure.

122
00:12:52,613 --> 00:12:53,966
(alarm)

123
00:13:48,373 --> 00:13:50,364
(door opens)

124
00:13:56,453 --> 00:14:00,207
- My name is Jack Bauer, and l work for C...
- CTU.

125
00:14:00,293 --> 00:14:05,492
l know who you are. l checked you out.
My name is DeSalvo. DOD.

126
00:14:05,573 --> 00:14:09,851
Whatever this place is, it's obvious
that no one's supposed to know it's here.

127
00:14:09,933 --> 00:14:12,049
Well, you seem to have found it OK.

128
00:14:12,133 --> 00:14:17,730
This is a prison facility - class-three detention
centre. So what the hell are you doin' here?

129
00:14:17,813 --> 00:14:22,170
At 8am this morning there was
an assassination attempt on Senator Palmer.

130
00:14:22,253 --> 00:14:27,327
l'm the lead investigator. l was following
a thread. The thread led me here.

131
00:14:27,893 --> 00:14:29,963
l need more than that.

132
00:14:31,973 --> 00:14:35,488
The people that want Palmer dead
bribed someone from the power company

133
00:14:35,573 --> 00:14:38,565
to shut down the electricity
to the grid you're hooked into.

134
00:14:38,653 --> 00:14:41,531
They were ordered to do this at 7.20.

135
00:14:43,973 --> 00:14:47,124
Something's gonna happen
here then, isn't it?

136
00:14:49,453 --> 00:14:51,683
Mr DeSalvo, you better listen to me.

137
00:14:51,773 --> 00:14:55,686
The people that are behind this
assassination attempt are ex-military Serbs.

138
00:14:55,773 --> 00:14:59,368
They work for the Drazen family.
They've killed a lot of people today,

139
00:14:59,453 --> 00:15:03,571
and they'll kill a lot more unless we do
something. So, sir, l will ask one more time.

140
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:06,804
What is happening here at 7.20?

141
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:17,325
- A prisoner is being delivered by chopper.
- Who?

142
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:21,729
His identity's classified even from me.
They move him every few weeks.

143
00:15:21,813 --> 00:15:25,328
What do these... Drazens
want with him, anyway?

144
00:15:25,413 --> 00:15:27,927
lt's hard to tell
unless l know who the prisoner is.

145
00:15:28,013 --> 00:15:30,846
They might wanna kill him,
they might wanna set him free.

146
00:15:30,933 --> 00:15:34,926
Either way, you got about five minutes.
You'd better call for backup.

147
00:15:35,013 --> 00:15:37,652
- Backup can't get here in five minutes.
- Call anyway.

148
00:15:37,733 --> 00:15:41,282
lf l'm wrong, you've gone through
a little trouble. l'll take the heat.

149
00:15:41,373 --> 00:15:45,969
lf l'm right, you've potentially
saved every life in this building.

150
00:15:47,053 --> 00:15:48,645
Please.

151
00:15:51,653 --> 00:15:53,644
(dials phone)

152
00:15:54,293 --> 00:15:56,682
Yeah, have Wykoff call me ASAP.

153
00:15:57,493 --> 00:15:59,882
Thank you. What's your personnel here?

154
00:16:01,893 --> 00:16:04,805
Three guards,
plus a maintenance man, two technicians.

155
00:16:04,893 --> 00:16:09,205
- Are they weapons-trained?
- No, the civilians have never fired a weapon.

156
00:16:09,293 --> 00:16:13,684
The Drazens don't know that. lssue them
full service gear. Have them stand by.

157
00:16:13,773 --> 00:16:18,130
- To do what, exactly?
- To make this place look more secure.

158
00:16:18,213 --> 00:16:20,408
At least until backup arrives.

159
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:37,451
lt's almost time. Three minutes.

160
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:42,609
- You still haven't heard from your brother?
- No.

161
00:16:42,693 --> 00:16:45,332
He didn't verify meeting the man
from the power company.

162
00:16:45,413 --> 00:16:48,405
lf there was a problem, he would've called.

163
00:16:50,973 --> 00:16:55,330
You seem anxious, Harris. l thought
professionals didn't get anxious.

164
00:16:55,413 --> 00:16:58,723
Professionals get very anxious
when a plan goes off the tracks.

165
00:16:58,813 --> 00:17:01,805
- There's nothing wrong.
- Then what's Bauer doing here?

166
00:17:01,893 --> 00:17:04,487
Just get your men ready. lt's time.

167
00:17:31,613 --> 00:17:33,683
Hey. Come here.

168
00:17:33,773 --> 00:17:36,890
- No. Like this.
- (DeSalvo) All right, let's get moving.

169
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:40,807
Keep your stock in tight, keep your
weapon down. You're gonna be all right.

170
00:17:42,413 --> 00:17:45,803
- Any word on the backup?
- They're lookin' into it.

171
00:17:47,253 --> 00:17:48,845
Weapon.

172
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:57,642
- We good?
- Yes, sir.

173
00:18:00,093 --> 00:18:02,288
- Let's go.
- All right.

174
00:18:18,613 --> 00:18:21,127
(helicopter approaches)

175
00:18:38,893 --> 00:18:41,646
Put your men in front of the lights
so they can be seen!

176
00:18:41,733 --> 00:18:44,372
Form a line right in front of the lights!

177
00:18:44,453 --> 00:18:47,331
Look like you're ready for somethin'.

178
00:18:48,933 --> 00:18:50,924
45 seconds.

179
00:18:56,293 --> 00:19:01,492
You said there'd be a warden and three
guards. l count eight, including Bauer.

180
00:19:04,653 --> 00:19:07,406
- They're expecting us, Andre.
- Doesn't matter.

181
00:19:07,493 --> 00:19:11,884
The power's going down in 25 seconds.
The sudden darkness will disorient them.

182
00:19:11,973 --> 00:19:14,692
- What if there is no darkness?
- There will be.

183
00:19:20,533 --> 00:19:22,524
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

184
00:19:25,773 --> 00:19:27,604
Eight more seconds.

185
00:19:27,693 --> 00:19:29,570
Five... four...

186
00:19:29,653 --> 00:19:31,848
three... two... one.

187
00:19:31,933 --> 00:19:34,845
- The perimeter lights are still on.
- Dammit!

188
00:19:42,413 --> 00:19:46,725
- All right, we're still going.
- No. Security is twice what we anticipated.

189
00:19:46,813 --> 00:19:49,691
The lights are on. We'll be cut to pieces.

190
00:19:54,453 --> 00:19:57,604
- Get ready to move.
- We have to stand down.

191
00:19:57,693 --> 00:20:01,572
- My money, my decision.
- My crew. They'll obey my orders.

192
00:20:10,973 --> 00:20:14,852
- All right.
- Plans have changed. Stand down.

193
00:20:59,693 --> 00:21:02,412
- Sit down.
- My father is Jack Bauer.

194
00:21:05,093 --> 00:21:06,242
Sit.

195
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:13,484
He's the director of
the Los Angeles bureau of CTU.

196
00:21:13,573 --> 00:21:18,442
- Counter Terrorist Unit. Have you heard of it?
- l can't say that l have.

197
00:21:18,533 --> 00:21:20,683
Do you want the number?

198
00:21:22,773 --> 00:21:25,685
Look, what l want is
information on Frank Allard

199
00:21:25,773 --> 00:21:30,164
and his plans to buy and distribute
1,000 hits of ecstasy. That's it.

200
00:21:30,733 --> 00:21:34,567
l don't know him. l met him
for the first time a couple of hours ago.

201
00:21:42,133 --> 00:21:46,365
Do you know that someone tried
to kill David Palmer this morning?

202
00:21:46,453 --> 00:21:49,650
- Yeah.
- Aren't you curious how l know about it?

203
00:21:50,693 --> 00:21:54,481
l don't know. Maybe because
it's been on the news the last 12 hours.

204
00:21:54,573 --> 00:22:00,205
l didn't realise. l was kidnapped. By the same
people who were tryin' to kill Senator Palmer.

205
00:22:00,293 --> 00:22:02,932
l know this sounds crazy,
but they kidnapped my mother

206
00:22:03,013 --> 00:22:05,811
and tried to get my father to help them,
but he rescued us.

207
00:22:05,893 --> 00:22:11,286
Then he dropped you off at Frankie's so you
could earn spending money dealing drugs?

208
00:22:11,373 --> 00:22:15,207
No. No. They brought us to a safe house,
but it was attacked,

209
00:22:15,293 --> 00:22:18,490
and l think they captured my mother again.

210
00:22:18,573 --> 00:22:22,964
OK. You know, she told me you had
an active imagination. She wasn't kidding.

211
00:22:23,053 --> 00:22:26,363
- Who?
- Your friend. The one we picked you up with.

212
00:22:26,853 --> 00:22:28,127
- Melanie?
- Mm-hm.

213
00:22:28,213 --> 00:22:31,569
No! No. She's not my friend.
She thinks l'm after her boyfriend.

214
00:22:31,653 --> 00:22:34,725
You can't believe anything
she says about me.

215
00:22:36,293 --> 00:22:41,287
l'm gonna stick you back in the holding cell.
Maybe it'll convince you not to screw around.

216
00:22:41,373 --> 00:22:45,730
Call this number. Tell them that l am
Jack Bauer's daughter and that l'm here.

217
00:22:45,813 --> 00:22:48,805
Ask them if they think l'm screwing around.

218
00:22:52,813 --> 00:22:54,804
Come on.

219
00:23:00,333 --> 00:23:04,326
Wait. Just because they haven't attacked yet
doesn't mean they're not going to.

220
00:23:04,413 --> 00:23:07,086
Maybe. Maybe this is a crock
and there's nobody there.

221
00:23:07,173 --> 00:23:10,609
Drazen's crew is out there.
They didn't get the power to shut down.

222
00:23:10,693 --> 00:23:15,403
They're working on their contingency plan.
Trust me, l know these people.

223
00:23:16,813 --> 00:23:20,362
- There's not much else l can do.
- There is. Let me talk to that prisoner.

224
00:23:20,453 --> 00:23:25,083
No. Access is something l can't give. My
orders are explicit. l can't even speak to him.

225
00:23:25,173 --> 00:23:29,689
Everything happening here is connected to
the assassination attempt on Senator Palmer.

226
00:23:29,773 --> 00:23:34,164
lf you do not let me interrogate that prisoner,
you're putting the senator's life in danger.

227
00:23:34,253 --> 00:23:38,724
Listen, Bauer, you are welcome to go over
my head if you want, but l can't help you.

228
00:23:38,813 --> 00:23:41,202
Now, l gotta process this guy.

229
00:23:41,293 --> 00:23:45,047
- Wait. You said you work for the DOD, right?
- And?

230
00:23:46,973 --> 00:23:49,168
Can l borrow your phone?

231
00:23:50,493 --> 00:23:55,692
From the machine room
we'll go through the fire wall in section A4.

232
00:23:55,773 --> 00:23:59,971
- That's two inches of reinforced steel.
- We can take it out with a shaped charge.

233
00:24:00,053 --> 00:24:04,729
Concussion will disorient the men posted
there long enough for us to take them out.

234
00:24:06,093 --> 00:24:09,642
lf you have a problem, Harris,
share it with the rest of us.

235
00:24:15,333 --> 00:24:19,167
lt took a year to organise this operation,
and now it's all coming apart.

236
00:24:19,253 --> 00:24:21,687
Your brother disappears
before he can cut the power,

237
00:24:21,773 --> 00:24:24,526
we find we're up against
twice as many men as you said...

238
00:24:24,613 --> 00:24:26,604
We can still achieve what we came to do.

239
00:24:26,693 --> 00:24:30,732
l'm not against going in, Andre.
As long as we take the time to do it right.

240
00:24:30,813 --> 00:24:35,170
- You don't think this is the right way?
- l'd say the odds pretty much suck.

241
00:24:35,813 --> 00:24:38,486
How much worse would you
calculate they've become?

242
00:24:38,573 --> 00:24:40,803
- l don't know.
- Give me a number.

243
00:24:41,253 --> 00:24:43,813
10 per cent? 20 per cent?

244
00:24:43,893 --> 00:24:47,772
- l'd say 50.
- l'll adjust your compensation accordingly.

245
00:24:47,853 --> 00:24:51,732
- lt's not about the money.
- You took an advance. Signed a contract.

246
00:24:51,813 --> 00:24:54,043
Which you broke first, Andre.

247
00:24:57,613 --> 00:25:02,004
The next word that l hear from you
that isn't constructive...

248
00:25:02,773 --> 00:25:05,367
l will release you from your contract.

249
00:25:17,133 --> 00:25:20,569
l wanna clear every interview Nicole gives.

250
00:25:20,653 --> 00:25:24,851
Yes, personally.
Whenever possible, l wanna be there.

251
00:25:24,933 --> 00:25:26,924
Let me know.

252
00:25:29,093 --> 00:25:32,165
(Palmer) So, is it as bad
as Sherry said it would be?

253
00:25:32,253 --> 00:25:36,644
..predicted a sharp drop in Senator Palmer's
numbers, it's not turning out that way.

254
00:25:36,733 --> 00:25:41,932
lnstant polls indicate that the senator's base
ofsupport is holding steady in most areas,

255
00:25:42,013 --> 00:25:45,210
and in some cases it's actually increasing.

256
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:50,208
When asked ifhis disclosures made them
more likely to vote for him in the election,

257
00:25:50,293 --> 00:25:54,571
less likely or made no difference at all,
60 per cent said ''no difference'',

258
00:25:54,693 --> 00:25:59,608
22 per cent said ''more likely'',
while only 18 per cent said ''less likely''.

259
00:25:59,693 --> 00:26:00,887
(phone rings)

260
00:26:00,973 --> 00:26:03,009
Looks like you were right, David.

261
00:26:03,093 --> 00:26:06,881
..seemed to indicate that voters
approved of Senator Palmer's honesty

262
00:26:06,973 --> 00:26:11,808
before a national television audience
a little more than a half-hour ago.

263
00:26:11,893 --> 00:26:15,602
Senator. lt's a Jack Bauer. He says it's urgent.

264
00:26:17,613 --> 00:26:21,128
Thank you. Jack, it's me.
Did you get anything from Alexis Drazen?

265
00:26:21,213 --> 00:26:25,092
No. He's coming out of surgery now, but
l did follow up a lead we got from his hotel.

266
00:26:25,173 --> 00:26:27,243
- l'm gonna need your help.
- Go on.

267
00:26:27,333 --> 00:26:31,212
l'm at a class-three detention facility.
lt's a prison that doesn't exist,

268
00:26:31,293 --> 00:26:34,285
- and neither does its new prisoner.
- Who's the prisoner?

269
00:26:34,373 --> 00:26:37,843
That's where l need your help.
This is run by the Department of Defense.

270
00:26:37,933 --> 00:26:42,529
- You want me to pull some strings?
- l need access to the prisoner.

271
00:26:42,613 --> 00:26:45,081
The facility's in Saugus
at the address you gave me.

272
00:26:45,173 --> 00:26:49,530
The warden's name is DeSalvo.
He's a reasonable guy, but his hands are tied.

273
00:26:49,613 --> 00:26:52,081
- l'll do what l can.
- Thank you, sir.

274
00:28:15,853 --> 00:28:18,287
Come on, you son of a bitch, turn around.

275
00:28:21,173 --> 00:28:22,891
(voices)

276
00:28:36,853 --> 00:28:41,449
- That prisoner's identity is classified!
- l need to know who that prisoner is.

277
00:28:41,533 --> 00:28:43,125
No.

278
00:28:52,893 --> 00:28:54,884
That's impossible.

279
00:28:56,773 --> 00:28:58,764
You recognise him?

280
00:28:59,333 --> 00:29:02,723
- That's Victor Drazen.
- Who is he?

281
00:29:03,293 --> 00:29:06,091
The man l killed two years ago.

282
00:29:28,733 --> 00:29:32,646
All right, listen, Bauer. You're asking me
to risk my job, maybe go to jail.

283
00:29:32,733 --> 00:29:36,726
l need some quid pro quo.
What's your connection to this guy?

284
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:41,651
What l'm about to tell you
is secured information.

285
00:29:41,733 --> 00:29:43,724
Two years ago
a congressional subcommittee

286
00:29:43,813 --> 00:29:47,362
decided Victor Drazen was
the key threat to the peace in Bosnia.

287
00:29:47,453 --> 00:29:50,809
So they authorised a mission
to take him out. l led that mission.

288
00:29:50,893 --> 00:29:52,884
When we got there, things went wrong.

289
00:29:52,973 --> 00:29:56,807
Today l found out that Drazen's wife
and daughter were killed in the attack.

290
00:29:56,893 --> 00:29:59,885
l thought we'd killed Drazen,
but apparently l was wrong.

291
00:29:59,973 --> 00:30:02,248
So now his sons wanna break him out.

292
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:04,608
And they wanna exact a revenge on me.

293
00:30:04,693 --> 00:30:09,562
His people kidnapped my wife and daughter.
We got them back. They're safe for now.

294
00:30:09,653 --> 00:30:15,125
But if Drazen escapes, l lose any leverage
l've got of keeping his people from my family.

295
00:30:16,333 --> 00:30:19,370
- l'll make another call.
- We don't have time for calls.

296
00:30:19,453 --> 00:30:22,968
We need to take this prisoner
and move him ourselves now.

297
00:30:23,053 --> 00:30:25,283
l said l'll make a call.

298
00:30:28,013 --> 00:30:33,041
- We still need to cut the power.
- But your brother hasn't contacted us yet.

299
00:30:33,133 --> 00:30:35,363
He would have called by now...

300
00:30:35,453 --> 00:30:37,887
if he were alive.

301
00:30:37,973 --> 00:30:42,603
We should assume Alexis is dead.
There may be another way, though.

302
00:30:44,173 --> 00:30:47,449
The substation for this sector's
a half-mile from here.

303
00:30:47,533 --> 00:30:50,764
A few ounces of C-5 should be sufficient.

304
00:30:50,853 --> 00:30:53,845
To save time, we'll go in through the front.

305
00:30:54,733 --> 00:30:57,531
The idea is not to attract attention.

306
00:30:58,813 --> 00:31:01,611
The idea is to get my father out of prison.

307
00:31:03,093 --> 00:31:05,812
This is the best chance we'll ever have.

308
00:31:11,013 --> 00:31:13,971
- These don't match.
- Uh-huh.

309
00:31:14,053 --> 00:31:17,363
Hold on. Where's Jack?
l thought he was with you.

310
00:31:17,453 --> 00:31:20,013
- He opted to stay in the field. Literally.
- ln Saugus?

311
00:31:20,093 --> 00:31:23,972
- Yeah, the address from the Drazen file.
- Why didn't he come back with you?

312
00:31:24,053 --> 00:31:27,841
l don't know. He's a stubborn guy.
He insisted on staying.

313
00:31:27,933 --> 00:31:32,245
Meanwhile, Alexis Drazen came to at the
hospital, so l headed there to interrogate him.

314
00:31:32,333 --> 00:31:36,531
l cut off his morphine supply, so
he should be pretty chatty in about an hour.

315
00:31:36,613 --> 00:31:39,889
You didn't tell Jack about his family,
did you? What are you doing?

316
00:31:39,973 --> 00:31:43,602
What are you doing? The last time l checked,
it wasn't in my job description

317
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:46,571
to have to explain myself to my subordinates.

318
00:31:46,653 --> 00:31:49,451
Now, unless they've called off
the hit on Palmer's life,

319
00:31:49,533 --> 00:31:53,082
you should be working on securing
his agenda for the rest of the day.

320
00:31:53,173 --> 00:31:56,370
Looks like he's going to be
our next president.

321
00:32:06,173 --> 00:32:11,805
(TV) Senator Palmer has carried New York,
and with polls closing shortly in California,

322
00:32:11,893 --> 00:32:16,603
it now appears that Senator Palmer
will maintain his lead...

323
00:32:18,373 --> 00:32:22,002
Hey. Everyone's outside
celebrating the latest poll.

324
00:32:22,813 --> 00:32:24,804
Come on out, sweetheart.

325
00:32:34,333 --> 00:32:36,801
What is it, David? What's wrong now?

326
00:32:37,933 --> 00:32:41,084
Before, when you said it was over,

327
00:32:41,173 --> 00:32:45,132
and l asked you what you meant,
the campaign or me...

328
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:50,412
What l said came out of wanting to protect
my family, wanting to protect you.

329
00:32:50,493 --> 00:32:52,802
You can't hold that against me.

330
00:32:53,533 --> 00:32:55,125
Sherry...

331
00:32:58,173 --> 00:33:00,641
you're an amazing woman.

332
00:33:00,733 --> 00:33:03,805
Smart, determined, sure of yourself.

333
00:33:05,173 --> 00:33:07,641
You always know what you want.

334
00:33:09,813 --> 00:33:11,963
But you don't want me, not really.

335
00:33:15,053 --> 00:33:18,170
l don't think you've wanted me
for a very long time.

336
00:33:18,253 --> 00:33:20,244
- That's nonsense.
- ls it?

337
00:33:21,413 --> 00:33:27,522
Maybe if everything with Nicole and Keith
never happened... but it did happen.

338
00:33:28,373 --> 00:33:31,683
And you kept the truth from me
for all these years.

339
00:33:32,653 --> 00:33:36,646
l don't think you could've done that
without pulling away.

340
00:33:41,053 --> 00:33:43,044
And now...

341
00:33:47,893 --> 00:33:51,727
now l can't help thinking
that l don't trust you any more.

342
00:33:56,413 --> 00:33:58,563
And if l can't trust you...

343
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:02,802
how could l love you?

344
00:34:08,253 --> 00:34:10,244
Well, David...

345
00:34:11,413 --> 00:34:15,611
you may not love me,
but you will never leave me.

346
00:34:24,813 --> 00:34:28,328
You take all the time you need
to get yourself together

347
00:34:28,413 --> 00:34:31,644
and then you come out
and you greet all the people

348
00:34:31,733 --> 00:34:36,249
who have given up every day
and every night of their lives

349
00:34:36,333 --> 00:34:39,928
for the last year to put us in office.

350
00:34:41,693 --> 00:34:43,843
- Us?
- Yes.

351
00:34:45,373 --> 00:34:48,092
That's right. Us.

352
00:34:50,173 --> 00:34:52,767
Because come January, David,

353
00:34:52,853 --> 00:34:55,083
when you're being sworn in,

354
00:34:55,173 --> 00:34:57,562
make no mistake about it,

355
00:34:58,333 --> 00:35:02,565
this woman here will be
standing right next to you.

356
00:35:31,973 --> 00:35:33,964
(male guard) Open up two.

357
00:35:39,533 --> 00:35:41,524
(catcalling)

358
00:35:48,773 --> 00:35:51,685
(female guard)
Move away from the door. Now.

359
00:35:56,613 --> 00:35:59,969
(male guard)
OK, Martinez, settle down over there.

360
00:36:28,133 --> 00:36:32,285
One thing l don't get - if Drazen was
the target, then what's he doin' here?

361
00:36:32,373 --> 00:36:34,807
Someone thought he was
better alive than dead.

362
00:36:34,893 --> 00:36:37,088
By ''someone'', you mean one of our people?

363
00:36:37,173 --> 00:36:40,370
He's probably been feeding them intelligence.

364
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:45,245
Then why put you through
the charade of tryin' to kill him?

365
00:36:45,333 --> 00:36:48,530
Because they wanted the rest
of the world to think he was dead.

366
00:36:48,613 --> 00:36:53,084
My mission was set up to fail from the start.
l lost every man l went in there with.

367
00:36:53,173 --> 00:36:54,731
(phone rings)

368
00:36:56,933 --> 00:37:00,164
DeSalvo. Yeah, he's right here.

369
00:37:02,333 --> 00:37:04,847
- l understand.
- We got permission to move Drazen?

370
00:37:04,933 --> 00:37:10,007
No. That request is still working its way up,
but DOD says you can interrogate him.

371
00:37:10,093 --> 00:37:12,482
- Good.
- Bauer.

372
00:37:13,533 --> 00:37:15,524
Five minutes.

373
00:37:17,853 --> 00:37:19,206
Fine.

374
00:37:45,853 --> 00:37:47,844
My name is Jack Bauer.

375
00:37:54,293 --> 00:37:57,126
You'll have to pardon my surprise.

376
00:37:57,213 --> 00:37:59,204
l saw you die.

377
00:38:03,533 --> 00:38:05,922
l watched you enter a building.

378
00:38:06,653 --> 00:38:09,531
Nobody could've survived that explosion.

379
00:38:16,413 --> 00:38:20,804
Our intelligence told us the building
was empty when you entered.

380
00:38:38,773 --> 00:38:40,968
Your fight is with me.

381
00:38:41,493 --> 00:38:45,281
Not my wife, not my daughter, but with me.

382
00:38:47,013 --> 00:38:50,369
Please... leave my family alone.

383
00:39:00,853 --> 00:39:06,246
Mr Drazen, you have already lost
your wife and your daughter.

384
00:39:07,213 --> 00:39:09,807
You don't need to lose your sons, too.

385
00:39:11,173 --> 00:39:13,209
My sons are soldiers.

386
00:39:13,613 --> 00:39:15,649
Then they will die for nothing.

387
00:39:15,733 --> 00:39:18,486
We know about the rescue plan.
lt was scheduled for 7.20.

388
00:39:18,573 --> 00:39:23,693
We stopped it. We've called in for backup.
lf they try again, sir, they will die.

389
00:39:24,333 --> 00:39:27,211
Then you have nothing to worry about.

390
00:39:29,173 --> 00:39:32,529
- Call it off, Victor.
- How can l?

391
00:39:33,013 --> 00:39:36,244
The same way you've been
communicating with them this entire time!

392
00:39:36,333 --> 00:39:38,767
Call it offoryour sons will die!

393
00:39:40,013 --> 00:39:41,731
(buzzer)

394
00:39:41,813 --> 00:39:43,485
(door opens)

395
00:39:45,733 --> 00:39:47,928
All right. We'll move him.

396
00:40:05,813 --> 00:40:09,852
ls there another way out of here that's not
on the schematic? A fire or flood egress?

397
00:40:09,933 --> 00:40:11,605
- Yes.
- Good.

398
00:40:11,693 --> 00:40:15,686
- l'll get my men ready.
- Have them armed like we did before.

399
00:40:23,533 --> 00:40:25,524
Get up.

400
00:40:27,253 --> 00:40:29,244
Get up!

401
00:40:33,773 --> 00:40:37,607
We're evacuating the prisoner.
Have all personnel convene in quarter C.

402
00:40:37,693 --> 00:40:39,684
Yes, sir.

403
00:40:49,453 --> 00:40:51,364
Stop.

404
00:40:53,053 --> 00:40:54,645
(applause)

405
00:40:58,493 --> 00:41:01,132
- (DeSalvo) Move out.
- (Jack) Let's go.

406
00:41:18,373 --> 00:41:20,364
Get against the wall.

407
00:41:24,613 --> 00:41:28,367
- The power's down in the west quadrant.
- (man) Copy that.

408
00:41:28,453 --> 00:41:30,444
They are here.

409
00:42:03,253 --> 00:42:06,165
