1
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:19,068
We authenticated the data. Omicron made
the Sentox for the military. Who's Henderson?

2
00:00:19,151 --> 00:00:21,108
<i>- Someone I worked for.
- Where?</i>

3
00:00:21,192 --> 00:00:25,232
CTU. He was the man who recruited me.
Things ended badly between us.

4
00:00:25,313 --> 00:00:27,987
Are you accusing me
of being in bed with terrorists?

5
00:00:28,074 --> 00:00:30,794
I need access
to Omicron's Sentox programme.

6
00:00:30,875 --> 00:00:35,552
I gotta merge files, find out who was working
on this project. We need IT. They're next door.

7
00:00:35,636 --> 00:00:40,109
I listened to everything Bauer had to say. CTU
does not have enough information to hurt us.

8
00:00:40,198 --> 00:00:43,349
<i>- What about Bauer?
- In about one minute, he'll be dead.</i>

9
00:00:44,999 --> 00:00:47,560
Oh, my God!

10
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,030
How could I be so stupid?

11
00:01:04,285 --> 00:01:07,244
There might be an attack
on Suvarov's motorcade.

12
00:01:07,326 --> 00:01:12,448
My people are not gonna chase that white
elephant. They're trying to locate Sentox gas.

13
00:01:12,527 --> 00:01:16,124
Let people focus on their work
or I will have you escorted out of here.

14
00:01:16,208 --> 00:01:18,770
Lynn is mentally incapable of running CTU.

15
00:01:18,849 --> 00:01:21,000
- What?
- Section one-twelve.

16
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:24,049
Take Mr. Stiles and Miss O'Brian.
Put 'em in holding.

17
00:01:24,132 --> 00:01:26,521
And then escort Audrey Raines out of CTU.

18
00:01:26,612 --> 00:01:30,128
I'm relieving you of your command
under section one-twelve.

19
00:01:30,613 --> 00:01:34,369
- . Logan is with the Suvarovs.
- Get my wife on the phone.

20
00:01:34,454 --> 00:01:38,243
The terrorists were specific.
If I don't allow them to attack the motorcade,

21
00:01:38,335 --> 00:01:44,572
they're going to release canisters of gas
in multiple locations. You need to get out.

22
00:01:44,657 --> 00:01:46,933
We're under attack. We need backup now!

23
00:01:57,541 --> 00:01:59,055
We had an understanding.

24
00:01:59,141 --> 00:02:02,418
It happened outside of my authority.
I told no one.

25
00:02:02,503 --> 00:02:05,576
If Russia isn't going to pay
with the life of its president,

26
00:02:05,664 --> 00:02:09,783
then its new ally, the United States,
will pay with the lives of its citizens.

27
00:02:09,865 --> 00:02:12,778
Mr. President, this is our final conversation.
Goodbye.

28
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:14,265
No. Wait!

29
00:02:22,989 --> 00:02:25,629
- How long has he been conscious?
- Ten minutes.

30
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:32,106
Before you go in, you should be aware of
something. Tony's been asking for his wife.

31
00:02:32,192 --> 00:02:35,424
- He doesn't remember.
- The explosion, but that's all.

32
00:02:35,513 --> 00:02:39,985
- We have to tell him Michelle's dead.
- No. He's undergone severe trauma.

33
00:02:40,074 --> 00:02:43,750
Stress will raise his blood pressure
and make vascular damage worse.

34
00:02:43,836 --> 00:02:49,833
Please, just hold off on telling him
till his condition is stabilised.

35
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,679
Could you excuse us, please?

36
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:03,552
Tony.

37
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:07,476
- How are you feeling?
- They told me they took Michelle to Cedars.

38
00:03:07,563 --> 00:03:09,918
Yes, they couldn't treat her here.

39
00:03:10,003 --> 00:03:12,643
Why? How badly was she hurt?

40
00:03:15,365 --> 00:03:18,005
Is she gonna be OK?

41
00:03:18,086 --> 00:03:20,316
As far as I know, yes.

42
00:03:22,047 --> 00:03:25,927
What's going on? They killed Palmer
and they tried to kill Michelle and me.

43
00:03:26,008 --> 00:03:30,561
David Palmer was the target. They killed him
because he was going to expose someone

44
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:32,959
inside Logan's administration.

45
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:35,519
They set Jack up to take the fall.

46
00:03:35,611 --> 00:03:38,685
- Did they get Jack?
- No. He's alive.

47
00:03:38,772 --> 00:03:41,128
He's working with us on a provisional basis.

48
00:03:41,213 --> 00:03:44,091
- Bill, I need to talk to Jack.
- You need to rest.

49
00:03:44,174 --> 00:03:48,054
No, I don't need to rest.
I need to talk to Jack. Now.

50
00:03:49,296 --> 00:03:51,935
- I'll tell him.
- Thanks.

51
00:03:53,336 --> 00:03:58,731
Could you do me a favour? Could you get
a message to Michelle? Tell her I'm OK.

52
00:03:58,818 --> 00:04:01,572
I will.

53
00:04:01,659 --> 00:04:03,411
Tony.

54
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:07,295
We need you to get better.

55
00:04:34,789 --> 00:04:37,543
<i>This is Black Top One.
We're one minute out.</i>

56
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:40,543
Copy, Black Top One. We're standing by.

57
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:42,826
<i>Roger that.</i>

58
00:04:44,593 --> 00:04:49,588
The navy helicopter is on its way, ma'am.
It'll take us back to the retreat.

59
00:04:49,674 --> 00:04:53,111
He...

60
00:04:53,195 --> 00:04:56,233
didn't warn the motorcade.

61
00:04:56,316 --> 00:04:58,113
Ma'am?

62
00:04:58,196 --> 00:05:00,187
Charles.

63
00:05:00,277 --> 00:05:03,509
He knew about the attack, and...

64
00:05:03,598 --> 00:05:06,033
he just let it happen, Aaron.

65
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:10,471
That can't be true.

66
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,519
He didn’t just let it happen. He...

67
00:05:14,601 --> 00:05:18,881
He gave the terrorists
the Suvarovs' motorcade route.

68
00:05:19,643 --> 00:05:21,873
Ma'am, why would he do that?

69
00:05:38,089 --> 00:05:41,047
- How soon before you're ready?
- A couple of minutes.

70
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:43,121
I need to finish the arming mechanism.

71
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:46,760
Make sure you place the canister
to maximise casualties.

72
00:05:46,851 --> 00:05:49,286
It must look as if this is a primary target.

73
00:05:49,371 --> 00:05:51,806
It'll be taken care of.

74
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:55,644
<i>- Yes.
- Do you have the key card?</i>

75
00:05:55,734 --> 00:05:57,770
I'll have it within the hour.

76
00:05:57,855 --> 00:06:02,327
There can be no miscues. I'm using up
one of my canisters to create this diversion.

77
00:06:02,415 --> 00:06:06,092
Without the key card, it's all for nothing.
Call me when you have it.

78
00:06:06,177 --> 00:06:08,817
I will.

79
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:21,810
- Hello?
- I'm going to be there soon.

80
00:06:21,901 --> 00:06:25,178
- Make sure you bring the money.
- You'll have it.

81
00:06:25,263 --> 00:06:27,572
And you'll have your precious card.

82
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:34,619
Careful. It's all we've got left.

83
00:06:34,706 --> 00:06:40,543
Don't worry about it. In a little while,
we'll be able to buy all you want.

84
00:06:41,148 --> 00:06:45,904
<i>Navy transport has arrived on site.
I'll advise...</i>

85
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:48,550
Mrs. Logan and the Suvarovs
have been treated.

86
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:51,508
The chopper's picking them up now.

87
00:06:52,872 --> 00:06:56,228
- What do I say to my wife?
- She put you in an impossible situation.

88
00:06:56,313 --> 00:07:00,829
It's my job to handle impossible situations
and I failed, and not for the first time.

89
00:07:00,914 --> 00:07:04,623
I should never have given in.
I should have ordered back the motorcade.

90
00:07:04,714 --> 00:07:11,110
Sir, with all due respect, you don't have time
for self-recrimination. The attack failed.

91
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:17,194
We have to assume they'll make good their
threat to use the Sentox on American soil.

92
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:21,749
Has CTU made progress? Or are they waiting
for the other shoe to drop?

93
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:27,838
They're looking for a lead, working the scene
where the motorcade was ambushed.

94
00:07:29,842 --> 00:07:33,233
Bill. They're airlifting the bodies
of the terrorists to CTU.

95
00:07:33,324 --> 00:07:35,554
- When will they be here?
- Any minute.

96
00:07:35,644 --> 00:07:37,953
- Let me know what you find.
- You got it.

97
00:07:38,045 --> 00:07:40,195
- Jack's calling in.
- Put him on speaker.

98
00:07:40,286 --> 00:07:43,723
We're in an emergency briefing.
Bill wants to put you on speaker.

99
00:07:43,806 --> 00:07:48,086
- I thought Lynn took Bill off the roster.
- Lynn's been relieved of duty.

100
00:07:48,168 --> 00:07:50,762
- OK, fine. Put me on.
- All right.

101
00:07:50,849 --> 00:07:53,921
- All right, you're on.
- Jack, what did you find at Omicron?

102
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:58,562
Henderson set up the deal that allowed
the terrorists to gain control of the Sentox.

103
00:07:58,651 --> 00:08:02,167
He tried to kill me by blowing up a bunker
Sentox was developed in.

104
00:08:02,252 --> 00:08:06,611
I managed to survive, but the servers were
destroyed. Henderson managed to escape.

105
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:09,288
- Chloe, are you there?
- Go ahead, Jack.

106
00:08:09,374 --> 00:08:13,688
- Can you hack Henderson's computer?
- I did. Henderson's work station is clean.

107
00:08:13,776 --> 00:08:16,574
He wiped his hard drive,
but there's an active socket.

108
00:08:16,657 --> 00:08:19,729
- What does that mean?
- He's exchanging data with a link.

109
00:08:19,818 --> 00:08:21,410
Can you locate it?

110
00:08:21,498 --> 00:08:25,538
Yeah, the registry listing
is 5714 Tarrowood Drive, Toluca Lake.

111
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:30,420
- Tarrowood Drive? That's his home address.
- I'll send a tac team.

112
00:08:30,501 --> 00:08:32,697
<i>- No, Bill. I need to go in alone.
- Why?</i>

113
00:08:32,781 --> 00:08:35,741
Henderson's good.
He'll detect a tac team moving in.

114
00:08:35,822 --> 00:08:39,293
- How do you wanna play this?
- I'm the last person he expects to see.

115
00:08:39,383 --> 00:08:42,057
I should be able to walk up to his front door.

116
00:08:42,144 --> 00:08:44,739
All right, but I want you in constant contact.

117
00:08:45,185 --> 00:08:48,144
Henderson is our primary link
to finding this nerve gas.

118
00:08:48,226 --> 00:08:51,025
I know. I'll get back to you.

119
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:03,911
<i>You've reached Banco Buenos Aires.</i>

120
00:09:03,991 --> 00:09:09,385
<i>Enter your party's extension, or press
the star button for immediate assistance.</i>

121
00:09:09,473 --> 00:09:14,673
<i>- Your identification code, please.
- 8477C, as in Charlie.</i>

122
00:09:14,755 --> 00:09:16,586
<i>Yes, how can I help you?</i>

123
00:09:16,675 --> 00:09:20,225
I'd like after-hours access
to my personal safety deposit box.

124
00:09:20,316 --> 00:09:21,830
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

125
00:09:25,438 --> 00:09:27,076
<i>- Buchanan.
- Bill.</i>

126
00:09:27,158 --> 00:09:31,392
We found a schematic of some kind of
ventilation system on one of the terrorists.

127
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:35,268
Since that's the way to deliver Sentox,
this could be their next target.

128
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,194
- Do we know what building it's from?
- Not yet.

129
00:09:38,281 --> 00:09:41,638
Building and safety
are running it against their archive.

130
00:09:41,723 --> 00:09:44,157
<i>Upload it to Chloe and Edgar.
I want them on this.</i>

131
00:09:44,244 --> 00:09:49,000
Better make it fast. There's a number
handwritten in the margin. 1800 hours.

132
00:09:49,084 --> 00:09:52,078
- The attack could happen in the next hour.
- Yeah.

133
00:09:52,726 --> 00:09:56,242
That was Curtis. He's going to upload
schematics to our server.

134
00:09:56,327 --> 00:09:59,843
This is the likely target of their next attack.
There was a time on it.

135
00:09:59,928 --> 00:10:02,284
- It could occur in the next hour.
- Where is it?

136
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:04,838
We don't know.
The only thing Curtis could tell

137
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:07,603
is it's the ventilation in an industrial building.

138
00:10:07,691 --> 00:10:11,207
- How big?
- Enough to hold several thousand. Find it.

139
00:10:14,212 --> 00:10:17,250
- How are you doing, Tony?
- Fine.

140
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:20,929
Have you heard anything else
on my wife's condition?

141
00:10:21,015 --> 00:10:23,245
I haven't heard anything new.

142
00:10:23,336 --> 00:10:25,327
Sorry.

143
00:11:29,196 --> 00:11:31,585
- Tony.
- You have to get back to recovery.

144
00:11:31,676 --> 00:11:33,952
- Get away from me.
- Almeida, please.

145
00:11:34,036 --> 00:11:37,189
I said get away from me.

146
00:11:43,359 --> 00:11:46,273
Tony, come on.

147
00:12:00,004 --> 00:12:01,996
My God!

148
00:12:03,525 --> 00:12:05,562
Michelle.

149
00:12:52,693 --> 00:12:55,367
- Thank God that you're all right.
- Let go of me.

150
00:12:55,454 --> 00:12:58,492
Sorry. I made a mistake.
I didn't think I had any choice.

151
00:12:58,575 --> 00:13:01,009
Charles.

152
00:13:01,096 --> 00:13:03,610
It isn’t just that you...

153
00:13:06,817 --> 00:13:09,457
You didn't stand up to them.

154
00:13:11,298 --> 00:13:14,417
You should've stood up to them.

155
00:13:14,499 --> 00:13:16,377
Martha.

156
00:13:19,581 --> 00:13:23,974
Yuri, Anya, I can't tell you how glad I am
that you're both all right.

157
00:13:24,062 --> 00:13:26,624
Thank you. It was awful.

158
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:30,137
I'm deeply embarrassed
this could happen on US soil,

159
00:13:30,224 --> 00:13:34,424
but I promise you whoever did this
will be brought to justice.

160
00:13:37,546 --> 00:13:40,664
- Excuse me, Mr. President.
- Of course.

161
00:13:43,148 --> 00:13:45,743
We both know who is responsible for this.

162
00:13:45,829 --> 00:13:51,189
We believe it was the group who attacked the
airport, but we thought they were all killed.

163
00:13:51,271 --> 00:13:54,150
Obviously you were wrong.

164
00:13:57,473 --> 00:14:00,068
The situation is more serious than you know.

165
00:14:00,153 --> 00:14:03,352
The terrorists have possession
of a military nerve agent.

166
00:14:03,434 --> 00:14:06,666
They've threatened to use it
against the population of LA.

167
00:14:06,755 --> 00:14:09,190
- How long have you known?
- We just found out.

168
00:14:09,276 --> 00:14:14,067
But given this change of circumstances, I'm
asking you to honour the terms of our treaty.

169
00:14:14,157 --> 00:14:16,991
Allow my law enforcement agencies access

170
00:14:17,079 --> 00:14:22,838
to whatever intelligence your security people
have on these separatists.

171
00:14:23,841 --> 00:14:25,718
- You will have our help.
- Thank you.

172
00:14:25,801 --> 00:14:30,923
I hope you won't find this offensive, but
there's something that's been troubling me.

173
00:14:31,002 --> 00:14:33,836
- What is it?
- . Logan, her behaviour.

174
00:14:33,924 --> 00:14:37,315
She has not been herself.

175
00:14:37,405 --> 00:14:39,795
I'm sure she's very upset by what happened.

176
00:14:39,886 --> 00:14:43,516
Yes, I imagine she would be,
but I noticed this before the attack,

177
00:14:43,607 --> 00:14:47,317
from the time she entered the car
with Anya and me.

178
00:14:53,129 --> 00:14:56,361
The truth is my wife
has been under a doctor's care for a while.

179
00:14:56,451 --> 00:15:00,730
She suffers from depression and anxiety.

180
00:15:00,812 --> 00:15:03,531
It's been very difficult for both of us.

181
00:15:04,693 --> 00:15:07,811
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Thank you.

182
00:15:17,057 --> 00:15:20,687
- The guard said you wanted to see me.
- How long are you gonna keep me?

183
00:15:20,778 --> 00:15:26,935
You're not going out there any time today.
The district marshal's reviewing your case.

184
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:31,857
I need to ask you a favour, Bill. I know
I don't deserve it. I was unfair to you earlier.

185
00:15:31,941 --> 00:15:35,457
- What is it?
- I need to make a phone call.

186
00:15:35,542 --> 00:15:39,617
If you think you can get out of this
with a few phone calls, you're mistaken.

187
00:15:39,704 --> 00:15:43,664
It's not that, I swear. I'll give you the number.
You can clear it yourself.

188
00:15:43,745 --> 00:15:46,214
What's this about?

189
00:15:46,306 --> 00:15:50,094
My sister.
I need to talk to her about a personal matter.

190
00:15:50,187 --> 00:15:52,827
- It can't wait a few hours?
- No, it can't.

191
00:15:52,908 --> 00:15:58,825
Bill, please. She's in a little bit of trouble
and I'm the only one who can help her.

192
00:16:02,591 --> 00:16:04,821
I don't need to clear it.

193
00:16:04,911 --> 00:16:07,904
Get Mr. McGill a phone
and give him some privacy.

194
00:16:09,553 --> 00:16:11,863
Thank you.

195
00:16:17,115 --> 00:16:19,107
Thank you.

196
00:16:24,998 --> 00:16:27,068
- Hello?
- Jenny, it's me.

197
00:16:27,158 --> 00:16:31,870
Listen, I don't care that you took my wallet.
You can keep everything that's in it.

198
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:35,111
- I just need to get my key card back.
- What key card?

199
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:39,195
My CTU access card. It's of no value to you,
it just lets me in this building.

200
00:16:39,282 --> 00:16:41,432
Can't you get them to give you a new one?

201
00:16:41,522 --> 00:16:44,914
I mean, that's what I did
when I lost the key to my laundry room.

202
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:49,442
Dammit, Jenny. This isn't a laundry room.
This is a secure government building.

203
00:16:49,525 --> 00:16:53,599
If you don't want me to call the police,
you'll get me back the key card today.

204
00:16:53,687 --> 00:16:55,996
<i>- You hear me?
- Yeah, I do.</i>

205
00:16:57,167 --> 00:16:59,238
Listen, I gotta go.

206
00:17:02,329 --> 00:17:06,084
- Where's that card from Lynn's wallet?
- Why?

207
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:11,041
- I wanna give him his card. We don't need it.
- That's how I'm getting us all this money.

208
00:17:11,131 --> 00:17:14,205
You told me we were gonna take his cash
and a credit card.

209
00:17:14,292 --> 00:17:20,164
Yeah. I'm taking a credit card.
A $20,000 line of credit right here.

210
00:17:21,134 --> 00:17:23,649
$20,000?

211
00:17:23,736 --> 00:17:26,694
Who's gonna pay you that kind of money?

212
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:41,494
- Yes, Mr. President.
- I'd like to speak with my wife.

213
00:17:41,941 --> 00:17:46,015
- I'm sorry, sir. She asked to be left alone.
- I wanna see my wife now. Move away.

214
00:17:46,103 --> 00:17:48,571
Sir, she ordered me not to let anyone in.

215
00:17:48,663 --> 00:17:50,972
I'm not "anyone", Evelyn.

216
00:17:51,063 --> 00:17:55,138
I know, sir,
but she specifically mentioned you.

217
00:17:59,826 --> 00:18:03,867
I have to get to a meeting. Would you tell
my wife I would like to speak with her?

218
00:18:03,947 --> 00:18:06,622
Of course, Mr. President.

219
00:18:17,912 --> 00:18:19,630
Thank you.

220
00:18:20,552 --> 00:18:25,548
I'd like you to find Aaron Pierce right now.
I want to know how he's doing.

221
00:18:25,634 --> 00:18:30,106
- Is there a message you want to get to him?
- If he's all right, tell him I'd like to see him.

222
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:33,226
Chloe, come here.

223
00:18:34,557 --> 00:18:37,072
- I think I got a match.
- There's a discrepancy.

224
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:42,028
They're from different layers. Curtis's was
structural. This is an electrical blueprint.

225
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:46,751
You're right. Mr. Buchanan, Edgar matched
the schematics we got from Curtis.

226
00:18:46,841 --> 00:18:49,436
- Where is it?
- Tyler Memorial, Westwood.

227
00:18:49,521 --> 00:18:55,393
A hospital. Tell Curtis to activate a tac team.
I'll call Tyler Memorial, tell them to evacuate.

228
00:18:55,483 --> 00:18:58,124
<i>- Operations.
- Put me through to Tyler Memorial.</i>

229
00:19:45,539 --> 00:19:48,895
This is Bauer. I'm on site
at the Henderson house. Do you copy?

230
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:53,213
We found intel on the body of a dead terrorist.
There is going to be an attack.

231
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:56,612
<i>- Where?
- Tyler Memorial, we think within the hour.</i>

232
00:19:56,702 --> 00:19:59,820
OK, I copy. I'm moving in now.

233
00:20:30,512 --> 00:20:32,549
<i>- Miriam.
- Who?</i>

234
00:20:32,633 --> 00:20:35,101
Christopher's wife. He's not here.

235
00:20:35,194 --> 00:20:39,154
- Tell Chloe I'm gonna get back to her.
- All right. We're on it.

236
00:20:41,716 --> 00:20:45,392
This is Manning with CTU.
I need to speak to the security officer.

237
00:20:45,477 --> 00:20:49,676
- You're talking to him. Tom Wegman.
- I'm heading to you now with a tactical team.

238
00:20:49,758 --> 00:20:54,038
The gas will most likely be released
into a ventilation unit. Seal the subbasement.

239
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:58,876
- I've called in a second security shift.
- How long before the hospital's evacuated?

240
00:20:58,961 --> 00:21:02,557
- An hour, maybe two.
- This attack could occur within 30 minutes.

241
00:21:02,642 --> 00:21:05,110
This is a large facility, Agent Manning.

242
00:21:05,202 --> 00:21:08,002
We have 600 patients,
many of whom need assistance.

243
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:11,919
Mr. Wegman, if this nerve agent is released
into the ventilation system,

244
00:21:12,005 --> 00:21:14,360
everyone inside that building will die.

245
00:21:14,446 --> 00:21:17,837
Do what you have to do,
but get those people out of that building.

246
00:21:18,687 --> 00:21:21,043
Right.

247
00:21:31,531 --> 00:21:34,251
Hello, Miriam.

248
00:21:34,332 --> 00:21:36,050
My God!

249
00:21:36,132 --> 00:21:38,647
We thought you were dead.

250
00:21:38,733 --> 00:21:40,645
Where is he?

251
00:21:40,733 --> 00:21:42,929
What are you doing, Jack?

252
00:21:43,975 --> 00:21:46,011
Miriam, where's Christopher?

253
00:21:46,095 --> 00:21:48,212
He's still at work.

254
00:21:48,296 --> 00:21:51,175
- Did he call you?
- You're scaring me, Jack.

255
00:21:51,257 --> 00:21:54,250
- In the last hour, has he called you?
- No!

256
00:21:54,337 --> 00:21:57,297
Now tell me what the hell is going on.

257
00:21:58,659 --> 00:22:01,618
I need to see his computer.

258
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:04,932
- What are you doing?
- Where is his computer?

259
00:22:05,942 --> 00:22:11,062
I'm not gonna tell you anything
until you tell me what is going on.

260
00:22:11,143 --> 00:22:15,695
Christopher developed a chemical weapon
system called Sentox nerve gas for Omicron.

261
00:22:15,784 --> 00:22:19,983
He enabled terrorists to gain control of it.
Now it's being used in Los Angeles.

262
00:22:20,066 --> 00:22:22,705
So where is his computer?

263
00:22:23,706 --> 00:22:26,824
Miriam, I am telling you the truth.

264
00:22:26,908 --> 00:22:30,901
- We have proof that he brokered the deal.
- That's impossible.

265
00:22:30,989 --> 00:22:34,107
Less than an hour ago, he tried to kill me.

266
00:22:37,111 --> 00:22:39,750
Move towards the living room.

267
00:22:47,794 --> 00:22:51,914
Keep walking towards the den.
I want you to take a seat on the couch.

268
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:55,511
Look, why don't we just call him?
I'm sure there's an explanation.

269
00:22:55,597 --> 00:22:57,508
Miriam, take a seat.

270
00:23:02,398 --> 00:23:06,358
You don't need the gun, Jack.
You're not gonna shoot me.

271
00:23:22,804 --> 00:23:27,322
Chloe, I need access to Henderson's
hard drive. I need you to talk me through it.

272
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:29,476
<i>OK, Jack.</i>

273
00:23:33,088 --> 00:23:34,966
Yes?

274
00:23:36,169 --> 00:23:40,129
- You wanted to see me, ma'am?
- Oh, yes, Aaron. Come in.

275
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:45,522
I didn't really get a chance
to say thank you before.

276
00:23:47,332 --> 00:23:52,566
You saved my life. I know that
you'll say it was all just in the line of duty.

277
00:23:52,654 --> 00:23:55,010
Well, you're welcome.

278
00:24:02,257 --> 00:24:05,136
The country's lucky to have men like you.

279
00:24:05,217 --> 00:24:07,209
I'm lucky.

280
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:15,049
I hope you'll allow me to say that.

281
00:24:22,463 --> 00:24:24,216
Mrs. Logan.

282
00:24:30,785 --> 00:24:33,175
Would you excuse us, Aaron?

283
00:24:36,787 --> 00:24:38,778
What is it, Mike?

284
00:24:38,868 --> 00:24:43,260
- The president's been trying to reach you.
- I know.

285
00:24:43,349 --> 00:24:46,183
I don't want to see him.

286
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:48,466
Would you like me to convey that to him?

287
00:24:48,551 --> 00:24:51,066
You can convey whatever you want, Mike.

288
00:25:01,315 --> 00:25:03,307
Mike.

289
00:25:04,316 --> 00:25:07,548
Mike, I want you to know
nothing happened in there.

290
00:25:07,636 --> 00:25:12,632
Whatever didn't happen,
make sure it doesn't happen again.

291
00:25:27,562 --> 00:25:30,635
- Clark, cover the north. Blake, you're with me.
- Manning?

292
00:25:30,723 --> 00:25:32,715
- Yeah.
- Wegman, hospital security.

293
00:25:32,804 --> 00:25:35,717
Thanks. Have you uplinked to CTU yet?

294
00:25:35,805 --> 00:25:39,879
We're doing it now. We've doubled security
at subbasement ingress points.

295
00:25:39,967 --> 00:25:42,879
- Nobody's getting down there.
- Good.

296
00:25:42,967 --> 00:25:46,405
The bad news is we have 26 patients in ICU
that can't be moved.

297
00:25:46,488 --> 00:25:48,639
Seven are high-dependency newborns.

298
00:25:48,729 --> 00:25:52,928
We can't relocate them without
specialised transport, which we don't have.

299
00:25:53,011 --> 00:25:57,004
- What about nearby hospitals?
- All neonatal units are in service.

300
00:25:57,092 --> 00:26:01,131
Thanks. I want a visual sweep
of high-probability targets in the hospital.

301
00:26:01,213 --> 00:26:05,492
Team A, start at the north end,
team B, take south. Move.

302
00:26:33,743 --> 00:26:36,052
It's Viktor. I'm at the hospital.

303
00:26:36,143 --> 00:26:39,181
- Then why are you calling me?
- They must have found out.

304
00:26:39,265 --> 00:26:43,179
The hospital's being evacuated.
The elevators and stairs are guarded.

305
00:26:43,265 --> 00:26:48,216
Calm down, Viktor.
Bring up the schematics of the hospital.

306
00:26:53,428 --> 00:26:56,900
There's an entrance to the subbasement -
an electrical conduit.

307
00:26:56,989 --> 00:27:00,188
- There's a good chance it isn't guarded.
- How do I find it?

308
00:27:00,271 --> 00:27:04,185
In the radiology wing. Call us
when you're there. We'll talk you through it.

309
00:27:04,272 --> 00:27:10,110
- I'll call you in a few minutes.
- And, Viktor, I need you to finish this task.

310
00:27:10,194 --> 00:27:12,469
Even if it means you don't get out.

311
00:27:14,635 --> 00:27:17,025
I won't fail you.

312
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:36,035
DOD concluded a briefing with
Russian intelligence. We were given a name.

313
00:27:36,122 --> 00:27:41,756
Vladimir Bierko. He made billions in
the post-Soviet economy in weapons and oil.

314
00:27:41,844 --> 00:27:45,234
<i>He bankrolled publications
promoting the separatist cause.</i>

315
00:27:45,324 --> 00:27:50,241
<i>- It's believed he was more than a sympathiser.
- They think he's financing these attacks?</i>

316
00:27:50,326 --> 00:27:53,603
- They think he's directing the attacks.
- Based on what?

317
00:27:53,687 --> 00:27:56,805
Communiqués intercepted
by the Russian security force,

318
00:27:56,888 --> 00:28:00,359
supported by the fact
that Bierko vanished three months ago.

319
00:28:00,449 --> 00:28:03,283
We posted Bierko's profile
to interagency servers.

320
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:07,284
Homeland Security has issued
an emergency brief to local law enforcement.

321
00:28:07,371 --> 00:28:10,045
Any hope of finding him before the attack?

322
00:28:10,492 --> 00:28:15,727
The most promising lead is a man named
Henderson. Unfortunately, he escaped.

323
00:28:15,814 --> 00:28:19,649
<i>Jack believes that files on Henderson's
computer could lead to Bierko.</i>

324
00:28:19,735 --> 00:28:22,250
He's trying to acquire those files now, sir.

325
00:28:22,335 --> 00:28:26,888
Let's hope he succeeds. The country's
suffered three devastating attacks today.

326
00:28:26,978 --> 00:28:30,368
- We need to stop this madman.
- Yes, Mr. President.

327
00:28:32,939 --> 00:28:37,138
- Chloe, have you found anything yet?
- The only thing on it is domestic stuff.

328
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:39,257
Bill-paying programs, music.

329
00:28:39,341 --> 00:28:43,051
He isn't trading music files with his office.
There's something else.

330
00:28:43,142 --> 00:28:46,294
<i>- I'm doing the best I can.
- Why don't you face it?</i>

331
00:28:46,383 --> 00:28:50,822
Christopher is innocent. He was when
you forced him out of CTU, and he is now.

332
00:28:50,904 --> 00:28:55,741
- Maybe you didn't hear. He tried to kill me.
- If he did, he was defending himself.

333
00:28:55,826 --> 00:28:59,581
No, he blew up the server room
while I was still inside.

334
00:28:59,667 --> 00:29:03,217
He was destroying evidence
that would've implicated him in this.

335
00:29:03,308 --> 00:29:09,306
This is familiar - you accusing him of being
a criminal. Why do you hate him so much?

336
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:11,381
I want you to know something.

337
00:29:11,831 --> 00:29:15,745
Chris never hated you,
not even after what you did to him.

338
00:29:15,832 --> 00:29:19,587
When he thought you were dead,
he looked in on Kim. He cared about her,

339
00:29:19,673 --> 00:29:23,827
just like he cared about you.
We both did. You know that.

340
00:29:23,915 --> 00:29:26,350
<i>- I found something.
- What is it?</i>

341
00:29:26,435 --> 00:29:30,224
- It's a shadow drive. It was partitioned.
- What's on the shadow drive?

342
00:29:30,317 --> 00:29:34,675
A log. It contains data for every satellite call
Henderson has made in the last year.

343
00:29:34,758 --> 00:29:38,149
Can you cross-reference those
with numbers the terrorists used?

344
00:29:38,239 --> 00:29:41,357
I got into the log,
but the lists are password protected.

345
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,114
Hold on. He had a secret file in his computer.

346
00:29:44,201 --> 00:29:47,035
- There's a list of numbers.
- And that implicates him?

347
00:29:47,121 --> 00:29:51,195
- We need access. You know the password?
- No, I don't.

348
00:29:51,283 --> 00:29:54,833
We believe there's gonna be another attack
within 30 minutes.

349
00:29:54,924 --> 00:29:58,200
Thousands of lives are at stake. Please.

350
00:29:58,285 --> 00:30:00,595
If you know that password, I need it now.

351
00:30:02,446 --> 00:30:05,041
I can't help you.

352
00:30:09,969 --> 00:30:12,529
<i>- Chloe, try and hack in.
- I'll see what I can do.</i>

353
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:14,282
Hurry.

354
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:19,644
Let me show this to Manning. Good work.

355
00:30:19,732 --> 00:30:21,290
Agent Manning?

356
00:30:21,372 --> 00:30:23,762
One of our guards caught this.

357
00:30:23,853 --> 00:30:27,813
This guy's dressed as an orderly,
but I've never seen him before.

358
00:30:27,894 --> 00:30:31,604
An orderly has no business being where he is.
That was five minutes ago.

359
00:30:31,696 --> 00:30:33,607
- Where is this?
- Subbasement.

360
00:30:33,696 --> 00:30:36,608
Team A, southeast stairwell.
Team B, form a perimeter.

361
00:30:36,697 --> 00:30:39,814
<i>- We have a suspect. CTU, copy?
- We copy.</i>

362
00:30:39,898 --> 00:30:43,414
Edgar, uplink the video surveillance
for facial recognition.

363
00:30:43,499 --> 00:30:45,968
<i>- See if you can get a match.
- Got it.</i>

364
00:30:55,703 --> 00:30:58,615
Curtis has a suspect.
We're running facial recognition.

365
00:30:58,704 --> 00:31:01,776
We're halfway through the database.

366
00:31:01,865 --> 00:31:03,457
- Got something.
- Print it.

367
00:31:03,544 --> 00:31:07,698
Curtis, we have a suspect. His name
is Viktor Grigorin, a Russian national.

368
00:31:07,787 --> 00:31:11,063
Served time for drug smuggling
and weapons trafficking.

369
00:31:11,147 --> 00:31:14,902
Copy that.
All teams, suspect is a confirmed hostile.

370
00:31:14,988 --> 00:31:17,264
Repeat, a confirmed hostile.

371
00:32:11,286 --> 00:32:13,880
Freeze!

372
00:32:14,847 --> 00:32:17,236
Don't move!

373
00:32:31,251 --> 00:32:33,767
Agent Manning,
you need to come look at this.

374
00:32:33,852 --> 00:32:36,048
Search him.

375
00:33:05,662 --> 00:33:08,336
Don't! It might be set to go off if it's moved.

376
00:33:08,863 --> 00:33:13,096
<i>- Chemical response team, we need you here.
- Copy that. On the way.</i>

377
00:33:13,185 --> 00:33:19,375
All teams, we've located the canister
and it is armed. Repeat, the canister is armed.

378
00:33:50,716 --> 00:33:53,674
CTU,
the chemical response team is on the way.

379
00:33:53,757 --> 00:33:57,228
Evacuation is in progress,
but there are a lot of people in here.

380
00:33:57,318 --> 00:34:01,915
Copy that, Curtis.
Edgar, notify LAPD and all relevant agencies.

381
00:34:01,999 --> 00:34:05,629
- I want a mandatory evacuation downtown.
- Yes, sir.

382
00:34:07,441 --> 00:34:10,991
- Henderson's using interlaced encryption.
- What does that mean?

383
00:34:11,082 --> 00:34:14,758
<i>- It'll take me half a day to crack it.
- We don't have that kind of time.</i>

384
00:34:14,843 --> 00:34:18,201
<i>Sorry. It's tougher than it looked
at first glance, OK?</i>

385
00:34:18,284 --> 00:34:19,354
All right.

386
00:34:19,445 --> 00:34:23,200
Jack, Curtis and his team
intercepted a terrorist at the hospital.

387
00:34:23,286 --> 00:34:27,565
- Did they take him into custody?
- No, he's dead. But they found a gas canister.

388
00:34:27,647 --> 00:34:32,244
<i>They're trying to disarm it now. There
are patients there that can't be evacuated.</i>

389
00:34:32,329 --> 00:34:35,287
Chloe, there's nothing you can do
about the hospital.

390
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:38,204
There are still 18 canisters out there.
Stay focused.

391
00:34:38,290 --> 00:34:41,920
- I know.
- If I got more personnel, would that help?

392
00:34:42,011 --> 00:34:44,082
I've already got three analysts on it.

393
00:34:44,844 --> 00:34:46,278
Miriam.

394
00:34:47,325 --> 00:34:48,474
Miri...

395
00:34:48,565 --> 00:34:51,285
Honey, I want you to pack a bag. I want you...

396
00:34:53,047 --> 00:34:55,003
Don't you move.

397
00:34:55,088 --> 00:34:57,397
Miriam, sit back down.

398
00:34:57,488 --> 00:35:02,689
Put your hands behind your head,
get back up on you knees. Now!

399
00:35:04,451 --> 00:35:08,285
I want you to handcuff yourself
behind your back.

400
00:35:14,734 --> 00:35:16,247
Get up.

401
00:35:16,334 --> 00:35:18,689
Take a seat next to Miriam on the couch.

402
00:35:19,335 --> 00:35:21,803
- Are you OK, honey?
- I'm OK.

403
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:25,408
- How do I find the nerve gas?
- I have no idea.

404
00:35:25,497 --> 00:35:28,535
- Where is it?
- Start with my knee, just like I taught you.

405
00:35:28,617 --> 00:35:30,654
I don't know what you're talking about.

406
00:35:30,738 --> 00:35:33,651
- Where is it?
- He doesn't know, Jack. He doesn't know!

407
00:35:33,739 --> 00:35:35,856
For God's sake, leave him alone.

408
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:40,014
Christopher, CTU found one of the canisters
at Tyler Memorial Hospital.

409
00:35:40,102 --> 00:35:44,016
It's armed. People are gonna start dying.
How do I find the nerve gas?

410
00:35:44,103 --> 00:35:48,176
Jack, leave him alone!
He doesn't know anything.

411
00:35:51,544 --> 00:35:53,979
Do you really trust him?

412
00:36:02,749 --> 00:36:05,661
Ask him what's in the briefcase.

413
00:36:05,749 --> 00:36:07,502
Unlock it!

414
00:36:22,795 --> 00:36:25,946
Ask him what he's doing with all the money.
Ask him!

415
00:36:26,035 --> 00:36:28,345
Christopher? Is this true?

416
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:31,554
- Have you been lying to me?
- I've been protecting you.

417
00:36:31,637 --> 00:36:33,309
- By lying?
- It's not that simple.

418
00:36:33,397 --> 00:36:37,438
- I defended you.
- I defended you too, because I love you.

419
00:36:37,519 --> 00:36:40,034
There's not one thing I've done out of greed.

420
00:36:40,119 --> 00:36:43,272
Even when they fired me -
framed me - I served my country.

421
00:36:43,361 --> 00:36:46,558
I don't care how you justify it.
I am out of time.

422
00:36:46,642 --> 00:36:49,679
You are gonna tell me now
how to find the rest of the gas.

423
00:36:49,762 --> 00:36:52,561
Go ahead and do it, Jack.
Get it done. Shoot me.

424
00:36:52,643 --> 00:36:55,033
Kneecap me. Go ahead, do it. Do it!

425
00:36:58,685 --> 00:37:03,077
- Oh, you son of a bitch!
- I shot her above the knee. She can still walk.

426
00:37:03,166 --> 00:37:09,164
If you make me shoot her again, she'll be
in a wheelchair. How do I find the nerve gas?

427
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:10,841
Dammit!

428
00:37:12,129 --> 00:37:14,884
- Where is it?
- Please. Please!

429
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:18,281
- Don't you make me do this.
- Tell him what he wants to know.

430
00:37:18,371 --> 00:37:20,169
I can't.

431
00:37:20,971 --> 00:37:22,485
I can't.

432
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:24,689
Forgive me, Miriam.

433
00:37:26,733 --> 00:37:29,693
You son of a bitch.

434
00:37:34,056 --> 00:37:36,890
You don't care about anybody.

435
00:37:36,977 --> 00:37:39,491
Not even her.

436
00:37:39,578 --> 00:37:44,892
Chloe, it's Jack. I need an ambulance on site.
I repeat, I need an ambulance on site.

437
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:49,451
Miriam Henderson's been shot. I'm bringing
Christopher Henderson into CTU.

438
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:53,615
I need an interrogation room prepped,
and a medic with hyoscine pentothal.

439
00:37:53,702 --> 00:37:57,776
- It'll be ready. Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine, just get the ambulance here.

440
00:37:57,864 --> 00:38:01,015
- The team's on its way.
- Put Buchanan on.

441
00:38:01,104 --> 00:38:03,824
Mr. Buchanan, Jack's on line one.

442
00:38:03,905 --> 00:38:06,499
- Jack.
- What's happening at the hospital?

443
00:38:06,586 --> 00:38:10,136
There's a CRT team on site. Stand by, Jack.

444
00:38:10,467 --> 00:38:14,427
- Curtis, what's your status?
- We're still trying to defuse the detonator.

445
00:38:15,269 --> 00:38:18,420
<i>- Look what we found.
- Is the evacuation on track?</i>

446
00:38:18,509 --> 00:38:22,345
Hold on, Bill.
- It's a remote timing display.

447
00:38:22,431 --> 00:38:25,549
- Can you defuse the detonator?
- Not in 60 seconds.

448
00:38:25,631 --> 00:38:30,913
- Then we're gonna have to get it out of here.
- It could detonate if you move it.

449
00:38:30,993 --> 00:38:33,064
That's a chance we'll have to take.

450
00:38:33,154 --> 00:38:37,433
All teams, we're moving the canister
to the containment unit. All right, go, go!

451
00:38:37,516 --> 00:38:39,632
Go, go, go, go, go! Come on, let's go!

452
00:38:39,716 --> 00:38:44,189
All teams, clear the halls. Clear the halls,
we're coming through. Go, go, go, go!

453
00:38:44,277 --> 00:38:47,509
Make sure the door's open.
Make sure the door's open.

454
00:38:47,959 --> 00:38:51,395
Go! Come on! We're coming upstairs.
We're coming upstairs.

455
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:54,278
Go! Go! Move! Move! Move!

456
00:38:56,041 --> 00:39:01,197
Go, go, go! Clear the hall!
Get out of the way! Get out of the way!

457
00:39:01,282 --> 00:39:04,036
Keep the halls clear! Coming through!

458
00:39:06,124 --> 00:39:08,240
- Go!
I need to clear this hall.

459
00:39:08,325 --> 00:39:11,762
Get them out of the way.
Go! Move! The hall's clear.

460
00:39:11,845 --> 00:39:14,679
Move! Move!

461
00:39:14,766 --> 00:39:17,679
I need to clear this area.
Move back!

462
00:39:17,767 --> 00:39:21,125
Step aside, please.
- Get the door open!

463
00:39:21,208 --> 00:39:23,245
Come on!

464
00:39:23,329 --> 00:39:25,719
All right, get it in there.

465
00:39:35,613 --> 00:39:38,082
We have negative pressure.

466
00:39:43,735 --> 00:39:45,727
Clear!

467
00:39:48,297 --> 00:39:52,086
CTU, the canister detonated
inside a containment unit.

468
00:39:52,178 --> 00:39:54,169
- The hospital's safe.
- Good work.

469
00:40:23,308 --> 00:40:27,348
- I have the key card.
- How long will it take you to reprogram it?

470
00:40:27,429 --> 00:40:32,060
Five minutes.
Then we will be able to use it to access CTU.

471
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:34,142
Good.
