1
00:00:13,402 --> 00:00:18,849
Right now, terrorists are plotting to
assassinate a presidential candidate.

2
00:00:18,939 --> 00:00:21,468
My teenage daughter is missing.

3
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:25,120
And people that I work with
may be involved in both.

4
00:00:25,787 --> 00:00:28,073
I'm Federal Agent Jack Bauer.

5
00:00:28,165 --> 00:00:31,933
Today is going to be
the longest day of my life.

6
00:02:26,904 --> 00:02:32,420
It is 7am on the West Coast and
the California primary is officially under way.

7
00:02:32,503 --> 00:02:35,812
We're here outside the San Clarita
power plant in Los Angeles,

8
00:02:35,901 --> 00:02:39,337
where Senator David Palmer will be
addressing local labor leaders

9
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:43,207
and members of the state energy council.
The senator pledged his support...

10
00:02:47,938 --> 00:02:50,054
- Yeah?
- Bauer's on his way. You in yet?

11
00:02:50,297 --> 00:02:52,653
- Just about.
- Good.

12
00:02:54,377 --> 00:02:58,608
This promises to be a landmark
day, as it's expected that Senator Palmer

13
00:02:58,696 --> 00:03:03,529
will get the delegates he needs to become the
first African-American presidential candidate

14
00:03:03,615 --> 00:03:05,684
of a major political party.

15
00:03:05,773 --> 00:03:10,846
Of the eleven states looking for delegates
today, California is expected to be crucial.

16
00:03:10,933 --> 00:03:16,448
And most of the polls say that
David Palmer will win by a decisive margin.

17
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:20,405
Have you decided?

18
00:03:26,368 --> 00:03:29,917
I've rewritten the speech
I was gonna give this morning.

19
00:03:31,007 --> 00:03:33,315
I'm gonna tell them about Keith.

20
00:03:35,846 --> 00:03:38,642
- What are you gonna say?
- The truth.

21
00:03:39,964 --> 00:03:43,240
That seven years ago he was
involved in an accidental death.

22
00:03:43,324 --> 00:03:47,521
I need you to stand by me, Sherry.
It's the only way to protect Keith.

23
00:03:56,121 --> 00:03:59,999
I will never forgive you
if something bad happens to my son.

24
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,154
He's my son too.

25
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:05,907
And we'll get through this.

26
00:04:06,917 --> 00:04:08,668
I hope so, David.

27
00:04:13,396 --> 00:04:15,465
Hey, Mom.

28
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:18,387
Good morning, honey. Where's your sister?

29
00:04:18,475 --> 00:04:21,352
- She changed her mind. She's not going.
- Really?

30
00:04:21,433 --> 00:04:23,709
She went to pick up
Suzy and Rachel instead.

31
00:04:23,994 --> 00:04:27,746
Oh, that's right, the Brenner girls are flying in.

32
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:31,301
So, uh, what's gonna happen this morning?

33
00:04:31,391 --> 00:04:33,542
We have to put this thing behind us, Keith.

34
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:38,066
Oh, by me being in prison and you in the
Oval Office? That how we put it behind us?

35
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:41,704
You're not going to prison.
You didn't do anything wrong.

36
00:04:41,789 --> 00:04:46,542
- That's not how a jury will see it.
- Just have a little faith in the system.

37
00:04:46,627 --> 00:04:49,140
What's this fairy tale that you're living in?

38
00:04:49,227 --> 00:04:53,104
Look, the world's gonna believe that
I killed a white kid who raped my sister.

39
00:04:53,185 --> 00:04:55,619
You think anyone will
believe it was an accident?

40
00:04:55,704 --> 00:04:57,262
- Yes, I do.
- Then you're a fool.

41
00:04:57,345 --> 00:04:59,904
- Keith, no...
- No, that's all right.

42
00:05:00,384 --> 00:05:04,454
You talk about fairy tales.
You think you can run from this?

43
00:05:04,543 --> 00:05:06,976
You think it's gonna make things better?

44
00:05:07,062 --> 00:05:12,454
I'm not running anywhere. I'd just rather not
spend my last hour of freedom with you.

45
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:18,287
Let's go and get this over with.

46
00:05:22,737 --> 00:05:25,046
- Martin Belkin?
- Yeah.

47
00:05:25,138 --> 00:05:28,924
Hi. I'm Jessica Abrams,
I work for Senator Palmer.

48
00:05:29,016 --> 00:05:31,529
- Hi.
- Pleasure to meet you. Can I help you...?

49
00:05:31,617 --> 00:05:34,765
- I got it.
- OK. Great. Follow me.

50
00:05:34,854 --> 00:05:37,970
- Is the senator here yet?
- Not yet, but he is on his way.

51
00:05:38,054 --> 00:05:40,566
- Great.
- I am a huge fan of your work.

52
00:05:40,654 --> 00:05:43,371
- Thank you.
- Right this way, please.

53
00:05:44,931 --> 00:05:49,321
Hi. I'm going to be taking
some photographs of the senator.

54
00:05:55,209 --> 00:05:59,439
I need a check on a Belkin. B-e-I-k-i-n.

55
00:05:59,688 --> 00:06:01,882
First name Martin.

56
00:06:06,806 --> 00:06:10,400
- Clear on Belkin.
- All right, copy that. Thank you.

57
00:06:11,485 --> 00:06:12,758
You can go in.

58
00:06:37,798 --> 00:06:39,788
Turn right at the light.

59
00:06:44,636 --> 00:06:47,274
- You see the bus stop on your left?
- Yeah.

60
00:06:47,516 --> 00:06:49,506
Pull over to it.

61
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:09,980
Hey, Jack.

62
00:07:12,269 --> 00:07:14,260
How you doing?

63
00:07:15,907 --> 00:07:20,616
- Don't touch it until I tell you to. Now go.
- Not until I can talk to my wife and daughter.

64
00:07:20,867 --> 00:07:25,256
Oh, you'll do this, because it really isn't an
inconvenience for me to hurt your daughter.

65
00:07:25,345 --> 00:07:28,655
Or your wife, for that matter.
In fact, here she is.

66
00:07:28,743 --> 00:07:31,815
Would you like to speak to your husband?

67
00:07:31,903 --> 00:07:34,781
Say anything you want.
Tell him you love him.

68
00:07:36,462 --> 00:07:37,690
- Jack?
- Teri!

69
00:07:37,783 --> 00:07:40,455
I don't know where I am.
I haven't seen Kimberly or...

70
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:43,612
You were saying, Jack?
You're not sure you want to do this?

71
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:50,573
That's what I thought. San Clarita power
station, 417 Ridgeway Road. Go there now.

72
00:07:59,736 --> 00:08:04,809
This is temporary, Mrs. Bauer. If Jack follows
instructions you'll be free within the hour.

73
00:08:04,895 --> 00:08:07,691
- Where's my daughter?
- She's here and she's safe.

74
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:10,521
Would you take me to her, please?

75
00:08:53,162 --> 00:08:54,515
- Hey.
- What, Milo?

76
00:08:54,602 --> 00:08:56,671
- What happened to Nina?
- She got called out.

77
00:08:56,761 --> 00:09:00,356
So what do I do about this key card?
This was supposed to be important.

78
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,432
They brought me in on highest priority
and I'm sitting around.

79
00:09:03,518 --> 00:09:07,636
I think Nina got some new intel that
pre-empts this. That's why she had to run out.

80
00:09:07,718 --> 00:09:10,914
- So what should I do?
- Why don't you help me format some files?

81
00:09:10,998 --> 00:09:15,387
They didn't bring me here
at five in the morning to format files!

82
00:09:45,829 --> 00:09:48,342
Does Milo know he's working
on the wrong key card?

83
00:09:58,664 --> 00:10:01,053
Is this gonna be a problem?

84
00:10:05,143 --> 00:10:08,896
Nina Myers is dead. Make up
a story for why she's not there.

85
00:10:27,857 --> 00:10:29,847
- Mom!
- Kimberly!

86
00:10:40,174 --> 00:10:42,562
It's OK. It's OK, honey.

87
00:11:12,566 --> 00:11:14,794
- Where's Dad?
- I don't know.

88
00:11:15,444 --> 00:11:18,082
- Does he know we're in trouble?
- Yeah, he does.

89
00:11:18,164 --> 00:11:21,121
He's doing everything he can, baby.

90
00:11:21,203 --> 00:11:25,878
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no, it's not your fault.

91
00:11:27,201 --> 00:11:29,111
It's not your fault, honey.

92
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:35,159
Why don't you tell me about these boys?

93
00:11:39,398 --> 00:11:41,831
I met them through Janet, and...

94
00:11:41,917 --> 00:11:45,704
she started dating this guy, Dan,
and his friend Rick came into town,

95
00:11:45,797 --> 00:11:48,185
and we just hang out, and... oh, God.

96
00:11:50,836 --> 00:11:53,712
- Have they kept you here the whole time?
- Yes.

97
00:11:59,873 --> 00:12:02,340
Janet was hit by a car.

98
00:12:03,951 --> 00:12:06,146
- I know.
- You do?

99
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:16,383
We are gonna get through this, I promise you.

100
00:12:42,422 --> 00:12:44,537
Hello?

101
00:13:12,932 --> 00:13:15,322
Come on, Jamey, pick up.

102
00:13:35,767 --> 00:13:36,961
- Almeida.
- Tony.

103
00:13:37,048 --> 00:13:40,243
- Nina, where you been?
- I can't get into it.

104
00:13:40,327 --> 00:13:43,283
Well, force yourself. Where are you?

105
00:13:43,365 --> 00:13:45,594
Just east of downtown.

106
00:13:45,686 --> 00:13:50,280
- What are you doing there?
- Tony, you have to listen to me carefully.

107
00:13:50,363 --> 00:13:53,399
No one at CTU can know I'm alive.

108
00:13:53,484 --> 00:13:56,997
- Who would think you were dead?
- I can't tell you any more right now.

109
00:13:57,081 --> 00:14:00,072
- Where's Jamey?
- She's working with Milo.

110
00:14:00,161 --> 00:14:03,039
- Get her for me.
- No, not till you tell me what's going on.

111
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,792
Please, Tony, this is an order.

112
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,792
- I need your help.
- All right.

113
00:14:16,357 --> 00:14:20,031
Threatening emails, hate mail for Palmer -
this is a giant waste of time.

114
00:14:20,115 --> 00:14:23,789
- When is Nina coming back?
- Probably not for a couple of hours.

115
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:26,229
What makes you say that?

116
00:14:26,314 --> 00:14:29,749
- I just talked to her.
- When?

117
00:14:29,834 --> 00:14:34,826
Couple of minutes ago. She's at Division.
It's possible she'll be there all day.

118
00:14:36,631 --> 00:14:38,826
What do you need?

119
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,622
Never mind.

120
00:14:43,469 --> 00:14:47,177
Look, if somebody doesn't tell me
what's going on, I'm going to Chapelle.

121
00:14:47,268 --> 00:14:49,338
I told you, I have to speak to Jamey.

122
00:14:49,428 --> 00:14:54,056
Yeah, and I just heard her tell Milo you were
at Division and you might be there all day.

123
00:14:54,146 --> 00:14:55,819
- Oh, my God.
- What?

124
00:14:55,905 --> 00:14:59,376
- Who did she hear that from?
- She said she just talked to you.

125
00:14:59,585 --> 00:15:02,861
- Nina, what is going on?
- We can't trust Jamey.

126
00:15:04,344 --> 00:15:08,097
- Jack said CTU had been infiltrated.
- Are you saying Jamey's a spy?

127
00:15:08,183 --> 00:15:11,140
Why else would she lie?
She must think I'm dead.

128
00:15:11,222 --> 00:15:15,693
- Why would she think that?
- I'll explain later. You have to bring me in.

129
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:17,812
OK. I'll come get you.

130
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:20,654
No. Stay there. Act as if everything’s all right.

131
00:15:21,019 --> 00:15:25,136
Jack behaved very strangely when he was
at CTU. These people must be watching us.

132
00:15:25,219 --> 00:15:28,130
I dunno, probably through
our own surveillance.

133
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:31,607
All right, look, I'll send a car.
What's your address?

134
00:15:55,091 --> 00:15:57,240
- Good morning.
- Mrs. Palmer.

135
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:59,604
How are you?

136
00:16:09,287 --> 00:16:11,481
How you doing today?

137
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:37,075
All you have to do now,
Jack, is get through security.

138
00:16:45,476 --> 00:16:48,673
Jack Bauer, CTU. I've been
cleared by Frank Simes.

139
00:16:55,475 --> 00:16:58,067
All right, I'll need you to open the case.

140
00:16:58,154 --> 00:17:00,145
Sure.

141
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:13,666
What do you need a laptop for?

142
00:17:13,749 --> 00:17:18,697
Everything we compiled on Palmer
over the last eight hours is in there.

143
00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:21,427
All right, you wanna lift that up, please?

144
00:17:30,745 --> 00:17:32,895
Turn it on.

145
00:17:32,985 --> 00:17:35,451
Just press any two buttons, Jack.

146
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:48,850
- All right, go ahead.
- Thank you.

147
00:17:53,819 --> 00:17:56,253
Thank you. Where is Senator Palmer now?

148
00:17:56,338 --> 00:17:58,330
- He's on his way up.
- Good.

149
00:18:02,137 --> 00:18:04,127
Excuse me.

150
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:11,092
Jack Bauer?

151
00:18:11,854 --> 00:18:13,572
Jessica Abrams?

152
00:18:13,654 --> 00:18:17,408
Yeah. Hey. What are you doing here?

153
00:18:17,493 --> 00:18:20,849
- I'm working security.
- Wow. How many years has it been, huh?

154
00:18:20,931 --> 00:18:24,765
- Since high school?
- Yeah. I'm sorry, I've got to get going.

155
00:18:24,851 --> 00:18:26,920
Hey, are you still racing motorcycles?

156
00:18:27,011 --> 00:18:30,127
- Keep moving, Jack.
- Not since my daughter was born.

157
00:18:31,289 --> 00:18:33,849
Look, I'd like to catch up later.
I've just gotta go.

158
00:18:33,929 --> 00:18:35,964
- Great, I'll be here.
- OK.

159
00:18:39,807 --> 00:18:44,084
- What do I do now?
- Hand the briefcase to one of our people.

160
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:46,632
- Who?
- I'll tell you when it's time.

161
00:18:47,005 --> 00:18:49,803
Go wait by the buffet table.

162
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,795
Now our election coverage
shifts to the polls.

163
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,837
Back east we've had some
interesting developments...

164
00:19:48,629 --> 00:19:52,257
- Senator, I'd like you to meet Martin Belkin.
- Senator.

165
00:19:52,348 --> 00:19:56,340
Good you could make it, Martin.
Jessica says you're the best.

166
00:19:57,987 --> 00:20:00,295
I look forward to working with you.

167
00:20:16,742 --> 00:20:18,732
You're so tired.

168
00:20:49,133 --> 00:20:51,124
Oh. Hi.

169
00:20:54,452 --> 00:20:56,885
I brought you some breakfast.

170
00:21:04,209 --> 00:21:06,359
- Is Kim OK?
- Who are you?

171
00:21:07,608 --> 00:21:09,997
- Rick.
- You're the one who kidnapped my daughter.

172
00:21:10,088 --> 00:21:12,806
- I didn't know.
- How could you not know?

173
00:21:12,887 --> 00:21:14,558
Hey! I tried to help her get out...

174
00:21:14,646 --> 00:21:17,683
Gaines wants to go over some stuff with us.

175
00:21:19,724 --> 00:21:22,192
- What's goin' on here, Rick?
- Nothin'.

176
00:21:23,805 --> 00:21:25,839
- Don't make friends.
- I wasn't.

177
00:21:25,923 --> 00:21:28,437
- Good. They won't be around much longer.
- What?

178
00:21:28,523 --> 00:21:30,512
Move it.

179
00:21:41,118 --> 00:21:44,713
OK, time to move, Jack.
Let's head across the floor.

180
00:21:45,558 --> 00:21:47,549
Excuse me.

181
00:21:48,638 --> 00:21:50,035
Excuse me.

182
00:21:52,716 --> 00:21:54,911
OK, Jack, head towards the south wall.

183
00:21:55,876 --> 00:21:57,911
- Hey, Jack.
- Hey, Jess.

184
00:21:57,995 --> 00:22:01,906
Hey, do you remember Tracy Zigler?

185
00:22:01,994 --> 00:22:04,222
Yeah. Yeah, I just saw her last winter.

186
00:22:04,313 --> 00:22:08,066
Well, we keep in touch,
and she said you and Teri got divorced.

187
00:22:08,352 --> 00:22:13,106
- Get out of there, Jack.
- No, we... We just got separated.

188
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:19,828
Jared, take care of this.

189
00:22:20,228 --> 00:22:25,143
Look, if you ever wanted to get in touch,
you can reach me at this number here...

190
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:29,464
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

191
00:22:29,547 --> 00:22:31,537
- I am so sorry.
- No, it's fine.

192
00:22:31,626 --> 00:22:33,264
- You sure?
- Yes.

193
00:22:41,183 --> 00:22:43,856
He's heading across now.

194
00:22:45,623 --> 00:22:48,614
Take a left in front of the turbines, Jack.

195
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,894
Show him your ID.

196
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,776
Jack Bauer, CTU.

197
00:22:59,858 --> 00:23:01,849
That's my boy.

198
00:23:04,977 --> 00:23:06,968
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

199
00:23:16,854 --> 00:23:18,845
Go to the end.

200
00:23:21,013 --> 00:23:23,730
On your left is medical station three.

201
00:23:32,889 --> 00:23:36,279
- I'm here.
- That's where I want you. Go in and wait.

202
00:24:01,043 --> 00:24:04,717
- Oh, my God. What happened to you?
- I'm OK.

203
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,556
You don't look OK.

204
00:24:12,759 --> 00:24:15,556
- Is it safe to come in here?
- Yeah, I looped the cameras.

205
00:24:15,639 --> 00:24:17,629
They can't see us.

206
00:24:19,078 --> 00:24:23,592
- Why is Jack doing all this?
- They've kidnapped his wife and daughter.

207
00:24:23,676 --> 00:24:26,349
- How long have you known this?
- Not long.

208
00:24:26,435 --> 00:24:29,825
- And you chose not to tell me?
- That's right. I was acting on orders.

209
00:24:29,914 --> 00:24:32,905
- Screw orders!
- Shh. Tony, I'm sorry.

210
00:24:33,714 --> 00:24:36,705
- Where's Jamey?
- She's still working with Milo.

211
00:24:37,393 --> 00:24:41,066
So what do you wanna do? Do you
wanna restrain her, call in Division?

212
00:24:41,152 --> 00:24:43,108
No, we can't call anyone yet.

213
00:24:43,191 --> 00:24:45,386
- We gotta do something.
- I know.

214
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:49,781
This thing must be about Palmer. They're
using Jack to, what, stop the investigation?

215
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:51,348
Maybe.

216
00:24:51,429 --> 00:24:53,896
Hang on. We gotta do something.

217
00:24:56,387 --> 00:25:01,063
- Are you sure this room is dark?
- Yeah, I checked the log. No active cameras.

218
00:25:02,546 --> 00:25:04,456
We should call Secret Service.

219
00:25:04,546 --> 00:25:07,981
If we do, the people holding Teri and Kim
will think Jack gave the order.

220
00:25:08,065 --> 00:25:11,818
I hate to say it, but it's not our problem.
We have one mandate - protect Palmer.

221
00:25:11,903 --> 00:25:14,258
- We gotta make the call now.
- Wait!

222
00:25:14,864 --> 00:25:17,093
Jack wouldn't put Palmer's life in danger.

223
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:19,695
Let's try to find out more
before we do anything.

224
00:25:19,782 --> 00:25:23,091
Are you giving me an order
not to call Secret Service?

225
00:25:26,579 --> 00:25:28,570
No, you're right.

226
00:25:33,058 --> 00:25:35,935
Hey, this is Tony. Get me
Agent Pierce's number, please.

227
00:25:57,571 --> 00:25:59,562
Assemble it.

228
00:26:38,801 --> 00:26:41,519
You want my prints on this weapon.

229
00:26:43,439 --> 00:26:47,910
Do you really think that anybody's
going to believe that I shot David Palmer?

230
00:27:02,554 --> 00:27:05,750
You better put that away.
Somebody might get hurt.

231
00:27:28,746 --> 00:27:33,660
We're watching Senator Palmer work the
room a little bit before he gets to the speech...

232
00:27:40,304 --> 00:27:42,499
Milo, come here.

233
00:27:43,304 --> 00:27:45,453
- You were right.
- About what?

234
00:27:46,183 --> 00:27:48,901
The key card. It was a forgery.
We found the original.

235
00:27:48,982 --> 00:27:51,290
- Where?
- Jack's office.

236
00:27:51,382 --> 00:27:53,575
- Why did he swap it out?
- Doesn't matter.

237
00:27:53,662 --> 00:27:56,891
Look, I sent it down to Archiving
to make a backup of all the data.

238
00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:00,131
Then it's going straight to you.
You'll have to work quickly.

239
00:28:00,219 --> 00:28:02,210
Just get it to me.

240
00:28:04,898 --> 00:28:07,617
A forged key card. What's that about?

241
00:28:08,338 --> 00:28:10,055
I have no idea.

242
00:28:21,534 --> 00:28:23,650
She's squirming.

243
00:28:27,692 --> 00:28:30,649
- Almeida.
- This is Pierce from Secret Service.

244
00:28:30,731 --> 00:28:34,519
Aaron, I called you because we have
new information you should know about.

245
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:38,961
- One of our agents, Jack Bauer, may be there.
- Yeah, he's here. I cleared him.

246
00:28:39,049 --> 00:28:42,404
Well, we learned that
he may have been compromised.

247
00:28:43,008 --> 00:28:46,795
- He may not be acting to protect the senator.
- Are you saying he's a threat?

248
00:28:48,846 --> 00:28:50,278
Yeah.

249
00:28:50,366 --> 00:28:52,720
Take the appropriate actions.

250
00:28:52,805 --> 00:28:54,796
She's on the move.

251
00:29:06,602 --> 00:29:09,478
OK, ladies' rest room. Second-to-last stall.

252
00:29:09,561 --> 00:29:12,233
- These cameras are on a 20-second loop.
- Am I clear?

253
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,556
No, not yet.

254
00:29:28,437 --> 00:29:29,835
Go. You got 20 seconds.

255
00:29:38,273 --> 00:29:40,150
Get out. Now.

256
00:29:40,232 --> 00:29:41,824
Get out!

257
00:29:44,071 --> 00:29:46,504
Get out! Out! Go!

258
00:29:57,948 --> 00:30:03,226
I gotta keep you guys working. The fatter
your pay cheque, the more tax you can afford.

259
00:30:05,587 --> 00:30:07,894
Excuse me, guys.

260
00:30:07,986 --> 00:30:10,738
- What's up?
- I just got a call from CTU.

261
00:30:10,824 --> 00:30:13,054
- We need to get you out of here, sir.
- Why?

262
00:30:13,304 --> 00:30:16,898
- There's a problem with one of their agents.
- What kind of problem?

263
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:19,656
He could be a threat to you.

264
00:30:19,742 --> 00:30:22,858
If he's one of ours, find him
and take care of this quietly.

265
00:30:22,941 --> 00:30:25,011
We are trying, sir.

266
00:30:26,901 --> 00:30:30,575
I tell you what. I'll lose the
face time, but the speech stays.

267
00:30:30,659 --> 00:30:34,971
- There's something I have to say.
- With all due respect, it's a mistake, sir.

268
00:30:35,058 --> 00:30:39,050
This information comes
directly from CTU headquarters.

269
00:30:40,216 --> 00:30:43,049
I am sure your people will take care of us.

270
00:30:51,133 --> 00:30:54,330
All right, everyone on the floor,
listen up. This is Pierce.

271
00:30:54,414 --> 00:30:59,122
Palmer has decided to proceed.
I repeat, Palmer will remain.

272
00:30:59,212 --> 00:31:02,044
We need to locate and detain a suspect.

273
00:31:02,131 --> 00:31:04,406
His name is Jack Bauer.

274
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:08,768
Bauer's 5'11", blond hair, 160 pounds.

275
00:31:08,849 --> 00:31:10,726
He is wearing a dark...

276
00:31:10,809 --> 00:31:14,118
brown jacket that may display CTU ID.

277
00:31:14,208 --> 00:31:17,643
This is Hayes. Possible 20 on Bauer.
How would you like me to proceed?

278
00:31:17,728 --> 00:31:20,639
- Hold your position. I'll be right there.
- Copy.

279
00:31:30,443 --> 00:31:32,797
Hi, Jamey.

280
00:31:34,163 --> 00:31:36,437
What's this all about?

281
00:31:36,522 --> 00:31:39,718
- Why don't you tell us?
- I've no idea what you're talking about.

282
00:31:39,802 --> 00:31:43,555
- Who were you going to contact?
- None of your business. It was personal.

283
00:31:43,641 --> 00:31:46,073
The same people who set me up to be killed?

284
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:49,912
- To be killed? What are you talking about?
- We don't have time for this.

285
00:31:49,998 --> 00:31:53,751
Talk to us, Jamey. Who's got
Jack's wife and daughter?

286
00:31:53,836 --> 00:31:56,750
- What are they making Jack do?
- I don't know!

287
00:31:57,317 --> 00:31:59,989
Richard Walsh is dead. So is Scott Baylor.

288
00:32:00,076 --> 00:32:05,194
You will be charged with murder and treason.
I suggest you tell me what's going on!

289
00:32:05,794 --> 00:32:09,069
- They told me nobody would get hurt.
- Who are "they"?

290
00:32:09,154 --> 00:32:12,827
- I can't tell you.
- Telling us everything is the only way out!

291
00:32:12,912 --> 00:32:14,903
You understand?

292
00:32:16,472 --> 00:32:21,146
I was just supposed to tap into the
surveillance. All the security cameras.

293
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:23,823
Then they asked me
to start sending messages.

294
00:32:24,029 --> 00:32:26,020
What messages?

295
00:32:26,109 --> 00:32:28,099
What messages?!

296
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:32,939
Mostly about Jack.

297
00:32:33,747 --> 00:32:39,775
Then about the key card. I didn't know this
was gonna happen. You have to believe that.

298
00:32:39,866 --> 00:32:43,334
OK, fine. We do. But now you have to help us.

299
00:32:43,425 --> 00:32:45,461
Who were you doing all this for?

300
00:32:47,503 --> 00:32:51,814
- No. I have to talk to someone first.
- What? No! There is no time, Jamey!

301
00:32:51,902 --> 00:32:57,692
Palmer is exposed. Jack's family is in danger.
You have to start talking to us. Now!

302
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:04,974
All right, look, I'll make sure everything you
tell us goes into cutting you a deal, OK?

303
00:33:08,378 --> 00:33:12,164
No, I'm not saying anything.
Not until I get agency counsel.

304
00:33:35,571 --> 00:33:37,845
Sit.

305
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:43,765
As Mayor of Los Angeles, I often get the
opportunity to meet truly remarkable people.

306
00:33:43,848 --> 00:33:48,319
People that strive for the greater good,
that work to make our world a better place.

307
00:33:48,408 --> 00:33:53,685
One of those people is here today, and
"remarkable" only begins to describe him.

308
00:33:53,766 --> 00:33:57,917
Ladies and gentlemen, the next president
of the United States, and my good friend,

309
00:33:58,005 --> 00:33:59,801
David Palmer.

310
00:34:21,518 --> 00:34:24,829
I love you, Kimberly. You know that?

311
00:34:26,037 --> 00:34:28,027
Yeah.

312
00:34:29,956 --> 00:34:31,948
Good.

313
00:34:32,994 --> 00:34:35,792
It's important that you know that.

314
00:34:37,315 --> 00:34:40,385
Mom, if you're feeling guilty
about our fight yesterday...

315
00:34:40,474 --> 00:34:42,862
I'm over it. I just wanna get home.

316
00:34:42,952 --> 00:34:47,468
That's not why I'm saying that.
It's just... we're stuck in this awful place

317
00:34:47,551 --> 00:34:50,542
and I just want you to know
that you're not alone.

318
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:55,861
Mom, you're scaring me.

319
00:34:57,750 --> 00:35:01,297
It's like you're saying this cos you
know something bad's gonna happen.

320
00:35:01,388 --> 00:35:03,378
No, no, no, no.

321
00:35:05,706 --> 00:35:07,698
It's just...

322
00:35:09,786 --> 00:35:15,655
I'm trying to explain to you what a simple,
powerful thing my love for you is.

323
00:35:17,584 --> 00:35:22,656
So no matter how bad things get, or how
good they get, that's not gonna change.

324
00:35:26,062 --> 00:35:28,813
I just don't know how
to do anything but love you.

325
00:35:48,895 --> 00:35:51,853
Thank you. Thank you very much.

326
00:35:53,774 --> 00:35:55,332
Thank you.

327
00:35:55,733 --> 00:35:58,122
- I'll be right back.
- Thank you.

328
00:36:00,812 --> 00:36:03,121
Thank you, Mayor Nelson.

329
00:36:03,212 --> 00:36:06,646
And thank you, kind citizens of Los Angeles.

330
00:36:12,008 --> 00:36:13,806
Identification, please.

331
00:36:13,889 --> 00:36:18,836
Now, this country
depends on a healthy economy in California.

332
00:36:20,288 --> 00:36:23,517
And the nucleus of that economy is energy.

333
00:36:23,887 --> 00:36:25,319
Jack, step out.

334
00:36:25,686 --> 00:36:27,677
We're ready for you.

335
00:36:28,645 --> 00:36:32,431
- To do what?
- Relax, it will be over in five minutes.

336
00:36:33,802 --> 00:36:37,033
.. is standing
right here in this room today.

337
00:36:42,642 --> 00:36:45,473
Do you see the photographer?

338
00:36:46,441 --> 00:36:49,431
- Yeah, I see him.
- Go over and join him.

339
00:36:59,197 --> 00:37:02,871
After he shoots Palmer,
he will hand you his weapon.

340
00:37:02,956 --> 00:37:06,071
- You gotta be kidding me.
- I know you'll be tempted to intervene,

341
00:37:06,156 --> 00:37:11,353
but you must believe me, if you do, your
family dies and we'll get Palmer anyway.

342
00:37:13,553 --> 00:37:14,702
I understand.

343
00:37:14,832 --> 00:37:18,029
When I started my campaign over a year ago,

344
00:37:19,272 --> 00:37:21,944
I made a promise to you who supported me

345
00:37:22,592 --> 00:37:28,540
that my campaign would be built on
integrity, commitment, and above all, honour.

346
00:37:32,508 --> 00:37:34,498
Thank you.

347
00:37:36,667 --> 00:37:38,658
Thank you.

348
00:37:54,222 --> 00:37:56,452
Agent Bauer?

349
00:37:56,541 --> 00:37:59,261
Alan Hayes, Secret Service.
I need you to come with me.

350
00:37:59,501 --> 00:38:02,856
- What's the matter?
- No problem, just come with me.

351
00:38:08,139 --> 00:38:09,934
Seven years ago...

352
00:38:11,099 --> 00:38:13,054
Gun! Gun!

353
00:38:18,335 --> 00:38:20,930
- Get him out!
- Somebody get Sherry!

354
00:38:22,256 --> 00:38:25,132
- Looks like Palmer's being shielded.
- Yeah, but why?

355
00:38:25,334 --> 00:38:28,531
Bauer! Bauer, what's happening?
Bauer, did you screw me?!

356
00:38:29,333 --> 00:38:30,527
I didn't do this.

357
00:38:30,614 --> 00:38:33,844
Do you understand?
Please, don't hurt my family.

358
00:38:36,772 --> 00:38:39,410
Don't hurt my family! I'll help, I promise!

359
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:43,482
- Please! Please!
- That's it, we're done. Kill the wife and kid.

360
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:50,919
Get outta here!

361
00:39:08,922 --> 00:39:11,231
I don't have time for this.

362
00:39:21,319 --> 00:39:22,593
- Hello?
- What do you want?

363
00:39:22,679 --> 00:39:25,238
Division wanted to pick up
Bauer at the power plant.

364
00:39:25,518 --> 00:39:28,157
- They've been looking for him all night.
- Why?

365
00:39:28,237 --> 00:39:30,591
He's been breaking protocol
since you got to him.

366
00:39:30,678 --> 00:39:33,236
Dammit!

367
00:39:41,515 --> 00:39:43,982
No! Oh, God!

368
00:39:44,073 --> 00:39:46,632
No! No!

369
00:40:11,547 --> 00:40:13,536
Gimme your hand.

370
00:40:16,585 --> 00:40:18,780
Please don't!

371
00:40:21,023 --> 00:40:23,413
- Eli?
- Yeah?

372
00:40:24,342 --> 00:40:26,936
I still need 'em alive.

373
00:40:27,023 --> 00:40:29,297
Both of 'em?

374
00:40:40,258 --> 00:40:42,648
Yeah. Take 'em back.

375
00:40:42,649 --> 00:40:43,649
No...
