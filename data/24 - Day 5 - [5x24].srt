1
00:00:15,917 --> 00:00:20,913
The coordinates for the targets. Upload them
into the missiles. Begin the countdown.

2
00:00:20,999 --> 00:00:25,152
How long to cancel the launch?
- I won't know until I see their software.

3
00:00:25,241 --> 00:00:28,359
We'll keep Bierko and his men out
so you can finish this.

4
00:00:33,763 --> 00:00:36,438
<i>Ten seconds to launch.</i>

5
00:00:36,524 --> 00:00:39,086
It's done. Launch sequence is cancelled.

6
00:00:39,606 --> 00:00:43,282
You were never really
gonna let me go, were you?

7
00:00:43,367 --> 00:00:44,767
No.

8
00:00:45,969 --> 00:00:51,967
You were responsible for the deaths of David
Palmer, Tony Almeida and Michelle Dessler.

9
00:00:54,532 --> 00:00:58,003
- I'm going after Logan.
- What do you mean?

10
00:00:58,093 --> 00:00:59,686
<i>I'll fill you in later.</i>

11
00:00:59,774 --> 00:01:02,812
Now I need you to walk me through
modifying some equipment.

12
00:01:02,895 --> 00:01:05,615
- Who is this guy?
- Morris O'Brian. Chloe's ex-husband.

13
00:01:05,696 --> 00:01:08,576
I need some modifications.
Can you do that without talking?

14
00:01:08,657 --> 00:01:11,252
I could, but it would be
a terrible waste of my charm.

15
00:01:11,339 --> 00:01:15,652
Jack Bauer's on his way here now.
He's going to confront your husband directly.

16
00:01:15,741 --> 00:01:18,016
Charles is leaving
for the airfield immediately.

17
00:01:18,101 --> 00:01:20,821
You have to find a way to stall him.

18
00:01:21,702 --> 00:01:24,775
- There's a helicopter waiting for me.
- Let it wait.

19
00:01:24,864 --> 00:01:27,299
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

20
00:01:27,385 --> 00:01:29,455
You're the president.

21
00:01:31,586 --> 00:01:34,864
Aaron said the recording
implicating the president was destroyed.

22
00:01:34,948 --> 00:01:37,861
- Yes.
- Without it, you can't mount a case.

23
00:01:37,949 --> 00:01:40,669
<i>Someone inside CTU
is setting up a digital uplink.</i>

24
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:44,380
If I can get Logan to acknowledge
everything he's done, that's all we need.

25
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:47,863
- I need to get on that chopper.
I don't see how that's possible.

26
00:01:47,953 --> 00:01:51,264
If Logan doesn't confess,
how far are you actually willing to go?

27
00:01:51,354 --> 00:01:53,471
As far as I have to.

28
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:06,351
Ah.

29
00:02:12,123 --> 00:02:16,720
Here. Let me get this for you.
Watch your hair.

30
00:02:16,805 --> 00:02:18,796
Thank you.

31
00:02:20,326 --> 00:02:22,317
You're welcome.

32
00:02:26,568 --> 00:02:28,446
I got a flight suit.

33
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:32,720
Go ahead.

34
00:02:32,811 --> 00:02:35,723
- Are you in the Secret Service outbuilding?
- Yeah.

35
00:02:35,812 --> 00:02:38,611
Morris and I have a way
to pull the copilot from the flight.

36
00:02:38,693 --> 00:02:41,253
- What about reassignment protocol?
- Working on it.

37
00:02:41,334 --> 00:02:44,611
Mike Novick has to verify the pilot codes.
It'll take one minute.

38
00:02:44,695 --> 00:02:46,812
Hold on a second. I'm switching to comm.

39
00:02:46,896 --> 00:02:48,888
OK.

40
00:02:50,538 --> 00:02:51,937
- Do you copy?
- Yeah.

41
00:02:52,018 --> 00:02:54,169
I'll get back to you when I'm on the chopper.

42
00:02:54,259 --> 00:02:57,013
Mike Novick's gonna call.

43
00:03:00,781 --> 00:03:03,171
- Morris?
- Yes, sweetheart?

44
00:03:03,663 --> 00:03:05,415
I need you to do one more thing.

45
00:03:09,906 --> 00:03:12,898
Some guy from Central called.
Says your packet's messed up.

46
00:03:12,986 --> 00:03:15,627
- I got that straightened out.
- He wants to talk to you.

47
00:03:15,707 --> 00:03:17,061
- Now?
- Right now.

48
00:03:17,148 --> 00:03:19,868
I patched it through
to the Secret Service outbuilding.

49
00:03:37,556 --> 00:03:38,750
Mike?

50
00:03:38,837 --> 00:03:43,070
I've delayed him as long as I can. Have you
heard anything from Jack Bauer yet?

51
00:03:43,158 --> 00:03:47,118
He's in the Secret Service outbuilding.
I'm sending him the documents now.

52
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,795
There's not much time.

53
00:04:00,725 --> 00:04:01,442
<i>Yeah, Mike?</i>

54
00:04:01,525 --> 00:04:06,317
Reassignment protocol and authorisation
are coming through to you. You'll need both.

55
00:04:06,408 --> 00:04:08,444
- How are we doing for time?
- Hurry.

56
00:04:29,176 --> 00:04:30,656
Hello?

57
00:04:30,857 --> 00:04:31,847
Hello?

58
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:34,168
John.

59
00:04:34,258 --> 00:04:36,614
Aaron. I thought you transferred out.

60
00:04:36,699 --> 00:04:38,133
Not quite yet.

61
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:42,419
Some guy from Central called,
said my packet's...

62
00:04:48,303 --> 00:04:51,297
You'll need this. Don't worry about him.

63
00:05:38,003 --> 00:05:44,161
Carouth has been relieved. Guess there
was something wrong with his packet.

64
00:05:44,246 --> 00:05:47,842
Ron Franklin. There's my protocol.

65
00:05:58,051 --> 00:06:02,410
This is not bad,
but needs to be more positive. Like, uh...

66
00:06:02,493 --> 00:06:08,492
Jack Bauer's on the helicopter. You have
to find an excuse not to get on board.

67
00:06:13,697 --> 00:06:17,931
Charles, excuse me.
Could I talk to you for a second?

68
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:21,980
Absolutely.
Will you excuse us for a second?

69
00:06:22,061 --> 00:06:26,294
I know it sounds silly, but I didn't bring
my medication. I just wanna have it with me.

70
00:06:26,383 --> 00:06:30,821
- We'll send somebody back for it.
- I don't wanna delay you. I'll be along later.

71
00:06:30,905 --> 00:06:36,060
Besides, Charles, I think that when you land
it would be better if I wasn't with you.

72
00:06:36,147 --> 00:06:38,217
- Why?
- This is your moment, Charles.

73
00:06:38,307 --> 00:06:45,864
I think that when you step out of that
helicopter, alone, after saving the country,

74
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:50,585
that is an image
that history will never forget.

75
00:06:57,235 --> 00:06:59,227
All right.

76
00:07:01,316 --> 00:07:03,706
Thank you, Marty.

77
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:08,353
But don't be far behind me, now.

78
00:07:58,498 --> 00:08:00,172
Captain.

79
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:05,580
I can fly this if I have to,
which leaves you two choices.

80
00:08:05,661 --> 00:08:12,854
You do as I say and you live, or you don't
and you die for nothing. You understand me?

81
00:08:12,944 --> 00:08:17,338
Wait until I give you my command,
then follow these instructions slowly.

82
00:08:17,426 --> 00:08:20,066
Disconnect your helmet
from the comm system,

83
00:08:20,148 --> 00:08:24,062
then I want you to rip out the mic cable,
take your helmet off and stow it.

84
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:29,820
Do it now.

85
00:08:37,154 --> 00:08:40,034
I'll know if you deviate from your flight plan.

86
00:08:41,356 --> 00:08:45,988
Mr. President, I have a message for you
from the White House.

87
00:08:46,078 --> 00:08:48,308
What the hell are you doing?

88
00:08:48,718 --> 00:08:50,232
Put these on.

89
00:08:54,841 --> 00:08:56,752
You.

90
00:08:56,842 --> 00:08:59,437
- It's Jack. Do you copy?
- I'm here. Where are you?

91
00:08:59,523 --> 00:09:03,996
We just left the ranch. I have Logan with me.
Is Morris standing by with the equipment?

92
00:09:04,084 --> 00:09:05,837
He's on his way.

93
00:09:05,925 --> 00:09:09,761
Make sure the pilot takes heading 286
for two miles, then breaks south.

94
00:09:09,846 --> 00:09:15,242
Captain, I want you to follow heading 286
for two miles then break south.

95
00:09:15,329 --> 00:09:17,365
There should be an industrial park.

96
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:21,001
There's an abandoned printing facility
you can use. I'll get back to you.

97
00:09:21,091 --> 00:09:22,889
Copy that.

98
00:09:24,932 --> 00:09:27,732
What are you trying to do, Jack?

99
00:09:27,813 --> 00:09:31,968
Whatever it is,
you know you won't get away with it.

100
00:09:32,976 --> 00:09:35,047
Are you going to kill me?

101
00:09:40,219 --> 00:09:44,418
I suppose you want some sort of revenge.
I understand that.

102
00:09:45,221 --> 00:09:48,020
Bad things happened.
I didn't want them to happen.

103
00:09:48,102 --> 00:09:50,297
People who work for me, they went too far.

104
00:09:50,383 --> 00:09:55,459
They did things that they thought
I wanted them to do, but they were wrong.

105
00:09:57,865 --> 00:10:02,383
You have to understand, I have always
acted in the country's best interest.

106
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:05,506
But you're just trying to get even.

107
00:10:06,389 --> 00:10:09,747
Do you realise what effect this will have
on the American people?

108
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:12,425
This day has been trying enough.

109
00:10:12,512 --> 00:10:15,471
And now the president is being attacked.

110
00:10:16,153 --> 00:10:21,388
If you wanna do what's right,
you will turn this thing around and go back.

111
00:10:24,036 --> 00:10:26,346
Dammit, Bauer, say something.

112
00:10:28,438 --> 00:10:30,509
Hello?

113
00:10:30,599 --> 00:10:32,511
<i>- Morris?
- Yes, love?</i>

114
00:10:32,599 --> 00:10:37,038
The helicopter's landing in an industrial
park one mile east of you. Head over there.

115
00:10:37,121 --> 00:10:41,514
OK. Now, I give this guy
what we worked on, and then I'm out, right?

116
00:10:41,603 --> 00:10:44,516
Yes. Make sure you have him call me
when you do the hand-off.

117
00:10:44,604 --> 00:10:46,004
- All right.
- Thanks.

118
00:10:54,768 --> 00:10:57,078
Shut it down.

119
00:11:05,412 --> 00:11:07,404
Undo your safety belt.

120
00:11:08,533 --> 00:11:11,367
Move towards the door. Slowly.

121
00:11:17,217 --> 00:11:20,016
Get out now. Move!

122
00:11:53,751 --> 00:11:57,905
Jack, we can work something out.
There's still time. What do you want?

123
00:11:57,993 --> 00:12:01,225
I could help you get away
with enough money to start a new life.

124
00:12:01,315 --> 00:12:03,954
Maybe find that daughter of yours and...

125
00:12:04,035 --> 00:12:06,392
and try to work something out.

126
00:12:07,597 --> 00:12:10,829
Whatever you want, it's yours.
You have my word.

127
00:12:10,918 --> 00:12:13,149
Your word.

128
00:12:13,239 --> 00:12:18,362
Jack, I'm the President of the United States.
I'm not carrying any weapons.

129
00:12:42,091 --> 00:12:43,922
Don't you make a sound.

130
00:12:55,455 --> 00:12:56,935
Hey.

131
00:13:01,778 --> 00:13:05,977
- Give me the case.
- Jack Bauer. I should have known that.

132
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,690
- Modified equipment?
- Yep.

133
00:13:13,262 --> 00:13:16,176
- That's President Logan, Jack.
- Get out of here.

134
00:13:16,264 --> 00:13:18,414
Yeah. Chloe wants you to call her.

135
00:13:18,505 --> 00:13:20,496
Go.

136
00:13:27,909 --> 00:13:29,901
<i>- Yeah, Jack?
- I have it.</i>

137
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:34,587
I just checked the response deployment. You
have less than ten minutes till they're on you.

138
00:13:34,671 --> 00:13:36,902
- Fine.
- Listen, Jack.

139
00:13:36,993 --> 00:13:38,904
I don't mean to put pressure on you,

140
00:13:38,993 --> 00:13:42,146
but if you don't get a confession
we'll be arrested for treason.

141
00:13:42,234 --> 00:13:44,226
Yeah, I know.

142
00:14:03,122 --> 00:14:05,318
Is this some kind of broadcast?

143
00:14:05,403 --> 00:14:07,713
<i>What is this?</i>

144
00:14:07,804 --> 00:14:10,524
<i>I would like to know,
is this an assassination?</i>

145
00:14:11,006 --> 00:14:13,680
A confession.

146
00:14:13,767 --> 00:14:16,282
Don't count on it.

147
00:14:16,927 --> 00:14:22,163
I know you're good at extracting information.
I saw what you did with Walt Cummings.

148
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:27,325
I think you'll be surprised to find out
that I'm a little tougher than that.

149
00:14:27,412 --> 00:14:29,449
Take a seat.

150
00:14:29,533 --> 00:14:33,448
Chloe, it's Jack. Can you hear me?
I wanna make sure you have good reception.

151
00:14:33,534 --> 00:14:36,811
Who are you talking to?
Are those your friends at CTU?

152
00:14:36,896 --> 00:14:39,286
You know you're
putting them in danger as well?

153
00:14:39,377 --> 00:14:41,732
- Coming through fine, Jack.
- OK, good.

154
00:14:42,378 --> 00:14:45,689
My people can't be far behind, Jack.

155
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:49,457
There's still time to get away. Take it.

156
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:55,254
The plan involving nerve gas was designed
to fool the terrorists and the Russians.

157
00:14:55,343 --> 00:14:58,256
Whether you planned it is irrelevant.
You authorised it.

158
00:14:58,344 --> 00:15:02,100
- You're delusional.
- David Palmer uncovered evidence.

159
00:15:02,186 --> 00:15:07,057
<i>He asked questions, and he was assassinated.
Other people were killed to cover that up.</i>

160
00:15:07,147 --> 00:15:11,142
People who served this country.
People I worked with. Friends.

161
00:15:11,229 --> 00:15:13,619
No. You're wrong. This is all a pack of lies.

162
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:19,150
The terrorists discovered your deception, and
deployed Sentox nerve gas on American soil.

163
00:15:19,232 --> 00:15:23,022
Every American who died today
as a result of terrorist activity

164
00:15:23,114 --> 00:15:27,109
is another murder that you're accountable for.

165
00:15:27,195 --> 00:15:31,634
Before you leave here,
you're going to admit it.

166
00:15:31,717 --> 00:15:35,234
I suppose if you hurt me enough, Jack,
I'll say whatever you want.

167
00:15:35,318 --> 00:15:37,469
But that won't make it the truth.

168
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:41,918
<i>And everybody who watches this
will know that perfectly well.</i>

169
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:46,118
- Who are your co-conspirators?
- There are no co-conspirators...

170
00:15:46,203 --> 00:15:49,560
Walt Cummings, Christopher Henderson,
James Nathanson

171
00:15:49,645 --> 00:15:53,480
have all admitted to being part
of this conspiracy. Now they are dead.

172
00:15:53,566 --> 00:15:58,038
Before Henderson died, he acknowledged
that there were others. What are their names?

173
00:15:58,128 --> 00:16:03,284
A man will say anything under torture.
This won't mean a thing.

174
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:06,488
Mr. Logan, I'm not gonna torture you.

175
00:16:06,571 --> 00:16:10,088
But you are going to tell me
what I want to know.

176
00:16:10,172 --> 00:16:13,484
Or, so help me, God, I will kill you.

177
00:16:34,141 --> 00:16:36,703
A year and a half ago,

178
00:16:36,783 --> 00:16:42,303
I was warned that my life was in danger
by someone within the government.

179
00:16:42,385 --> 00:16:47,017
I was told the only way I could stay alive
was to create the illusion that I was dead.

180
00:16:47,107 --> 00:16:50,464
I was forced to deceive people that I loved.

181
00:16:50,548 --> 00:16:54,144
My only daughter will never forgive me.

182
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:59,145
And as I see the depth
of your corruption unfold,

183
00:16:59,232 --> 00:17:03,670
I have no doubt
that you are that source of danger.

184
00:17:03,754 --> 00:17:08,112
David Palmer was a great man,
and he was a great president.

185
00:17:09,116 --> 00:17:11,869
But he was also my friend.

186
00:17:11,957 --> 00:17:15,108
He tried to warn me about you
and now he is dead.

187
00:17:15,198 --> 00:17:17,793
Other people tried to help me
and they are dead too.

188
00:17:17,879 --> 00:17:21,999
So, Mr. Logan, I hope you understand...

189
00:17:22,081 --> 00:17:25,392
I have absolutely nothing to lose.

190
00:17:25,482 --> 00:17:29,716
You are going to be held accountable for
your part of everything that happened today.

191
00:17:29,804 --> 00:17:35,358
You can't hide behind the presidency. Right
here, right now, you are gonna face justice.

192
00:17:35,446 --> 00:17:38,166
And make no mistake about this,
this is personal.

193
00:17:38,247 --> 00:17:42,401
And if you think for a second
that I'm scared to put a bullet in your brain,

194
00:17:42,488 --> 00:17:45,288
you don't know me.

195
00:17:48,171 --> 00:17:50,811
I'm gonna ask you one last time.

196
00:17:50,892 --> 00:17:55,045
Who are your co-conspirators?

197
00:17:55,133 --> 00:17:58,445
You have until the count of three...

198
00:17:58,535 --> 00:18:00,447
or I will kill you. One.

199
00:18:00,536 --> 00:18:02,971
I'll go down in history
with Lincoln and Kennedy,

200
00:18:03,056 --> 00:18:06,255
but you'll go down with John Wilkes Booth
and Lee Harvey Oswald.

201
00:18:06,339 --> 00:18:08,614
Two.

202
00:18:08,699 --> 00:18:10,418
You're a man of honour.

203
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:15,098
How can you assassinate a president of
the United States in front of the entire world?

204
00:18:15,181 --> 00:18:17,457
If you love your country, you won't fire.

205
00:18:17,543 --> 00:18:19,534
Three.

206
00:18:40,551 --> 00:18:42,144
You can't do it.

207
00:18:42,232 --> 00:18:46,625
No, Jack, it's all right. Jack...

208
00:18:46,714 --> 00:18:51,506
It's all right. It's all right.
It's right that you can't.

209
00:18:54,077 --> 00:18:56,194
I'm the president.

210
00:18:58,999 --> 00:19:00,399
Jack...

211
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,791
Jack, they're here.

212
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:32,289
Lie flat on your stomach! Put your
hands out in front of you. Extend your arms.

213
00:19:35,053 --> 00:19:38,410
- Mr. President, are you all right?
- I'm fine.

214
00:19:38,494 --> 00:19:41,168
I actually feel sorry for that man.
He's delusional.

215
00:19:41,256 --> 00:19:47,493
It would be better if he were put in some sort
of solitary confinement for the time being.

216
00:20:21,448 --> 00:20:23,086
Yeah?

217
00:20:33,652 --> 00:20:38,934
Jack Bauer wasn't able to get the president
to confess, Mrs. Logan. I'm sorry.

218
00:20:39,015 --> 00:20:40,767
Why not? What happened?

219
00:20:40,856 --> 00:20:45,533
I'm not sure of the details. Bauer's in custody.

220
00:21:00,183 --> 00:21:01,776
Gentlemen.

221
00:21:09,586 --> 00:21:10,907
Thank you.

222
00:21:24,672 --> 00:21:27,188
Couple more, sir.
Thank you, sir.

223
00:21:27,273 --> 00:21:31,063
Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen. That will be all.

224
00:22:14,492 --> 00:22:18,452
- Oh, God. David.
- Martha. Martha, please...

225
00:22:22,455 --> 00:22:25,813
- Marty, no. Don't do this to me now.
- You killed him. You killed him.

226
00:22:25,897 --> 00:22:29,129
- Marty, stop.
- You're a murderer! You're a criminal!

227
00:22:29,218 --> 00:22:31,813
- My wife is not well.
- Don't you... Let go of me.

228
00:22:31,899 --> 00:22:35,860
- Please escort her into the hangar.
- Don't you touch me! Don't you touch me!

229
00:22:35,941 --> 00:22:39,139
You don't know what he is.
He's not fit to be president.

230
00:22:39,222 --> 00:22:43,695
It is a sacrilege for him
to be even speaking David's name!

231
00:22:43,784 --> 00:22:45,854
Don't you... No!

232
00:22:45,945 --> 00:22:48,903
Let go of me!

233
00:22:48,986 --> 00:22:51,581
I wanna make sure that she's all right.

234
00:22:55,548 --> 00:22:58,461
- Has this hangar been cleared?
- Yes, sir. All secure.

235
00:22:58,549 --> 00:23:01,622
Good. Let them know
that I'll be back in a moment.

236
00:23:01,711 --> 00:23:03,702
Yes, Mr. President.

237
00:23:13,156 --> 00:23:15,307
Are you wearing a listening device?

238
00:23:15,396 --> 00:23:18,628
What are you talking about?

239
00:23:18,717 --> 00:23:21,028
I have to watch you, Marty.

240
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:25,193
You said that I was a good liar,
but I am nothing compared to you.

241
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,955
Charles, stop it. Stop it!

242
00:23:28,041 --> 00:23:30,033
Stop...

243
00:23:36,564 --> 00:23:39,478
OK, now, Marty. Tell me the truth.

244
00:23:39,565 --> 00:23:42,081
You're hurting me.

245
00:23:42,166 --> 00:23:44,886
You don't know what pain is.

246
00:23:45,969 --> 00:23:48,642
I'm onto you.
I should have seen it from the first,

247
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:52,519
but I wanted to believe
that you still cared for me.

248
00:23:52,611 --> 00:23:56,400
Making love to me was just a ploy, wasn't it?

249
00:23:58,533 --> 00:24:02,494
Took a lot of planning to get Bauer
on that helicopter. You were part of the plan.

250
00:24:02,575 --> 00:24:06,125
It was your job to delay me, wasn't it?

251
00:24:06,216 --> 00:24:08,685
Wasn't it?

252
00:24:08,777 --> 00:24:10,609
- Please...
- Wasn't it?

253
00:24:10,698 --> 00:24:15,774
They used you so Jack Bauer could get
to me. Come on, Marty. Come on, Marty.

254
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:19,537
- Admit it. You were part of it.
- Yes. Yes.

255
00:24:21,302 --> 00:24:23,453
Why?

256
00:24:23,543 --> 00:24:26,297
Why... why did you help them?

257
00:24:27,704 --> 00:24:30,345
Because you killed David Palmer.

258
00:24:30,426 --> 00:24:33,737
I told you, I didn't realise
that was going to happen.

259
00:24:33,827 --> 00:24:39,062
You... Your people killed him to protect you.
You covered it up, that's just as bad.

260
00:24:39,149 --> 00:24:40,867
I covered it up because I had to.

261
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:44,182
<i>- And others died to cover that up!
- For the good of the country.</i>

262
00:24:44,271 --> 00:24:49,666
You sold nerve gas to terrorists.
You're insane. You're insane!

263
00:24:49,754 --> 00:24:55,308
I did it for the good of the country
as I saw it at the time.

264
00:24:56,917 --> 00:24:59,954
You're such a hypocrite.

265
00:25:01,758 --> 00:25:05,718
After your performance today,
you're in no position to call me a hypocrite.

266
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:10,432
And I will tell you something else.
If you blow up like this one more time,

267
00:25:10,521 --> 00:25:16,315
I will fill you so full of drugs
you won't even remember your own name.

268
00:25:16,404 --> 00:25:22,720
And then I will ship you off to an asylum
and you can stay there the rest of your life.

269
00:25:22,806 --> 00:25:25,275
Are we clear?

270
00:25:27,889 --> 00:25:29,880
Are we clear?

271
00:25:33,251 --> 00:25:36,608
Now clean yourself up. You're a mess.

272
00:25:51,858 --> 00:25:55,818
Ladies and gentlemen,
the President of the United States.

273
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:59,932
Martha.

274
00:26:36,475 --> 00:26:39,275
My fellow Americans,

275
00:26:39,357 --> 00:26:42,667
this has been a terrible day
in the history of this country,

276
00:26:42,758 --> 00:26:46,912
and yet at the same time a triumphant day.

277
00:26:46,999 --> 00:26:53,350
Because in the end we won a significant
victory over the forces of chaos and terror.

278
00:26:53,442 --> 00:27:00,157
We have preserved and protected our
way of life despite the loss of innocent lives...

279
00:27:00,245 --> 00:27:03,477
I'll transmit in one minute.
Is the attorney general there?

280
00:27:03,566 --> 00:27:09,121
I'm here, Ms O'Brian. I certainly hope this
recording is as important as you claim it is.

281
00:27:11,969 --> 00:27:16,522
- Chloe, what's this about?
- I set up a call with the attorney general.

282
00:27:16,612 --> 00:27:19,730
- Are you serious?
- I'm very serious.

283
00:27:19,812 --> 00:27:23,409
- This is Karen Hayes, Homeland Security.
- Bill Buchanan, CTU.

284
00:27:23,494 --> 00:27:27,090
Sir, I apologise. Ms O'Brian
placed this call without authorisation.

285
00:27:27,176 --> 00:27:31,170
We had to do things under the radar
to protect you all in case things went wrong.

286
00:27:31,257 --> 00:27:35,251
- In case what things went wrong?
- It would help if I just played the recording.

287
00:27:35,339 --> 00:27:36,738
What recording?

288
00:27:36,819 --> 00:27:40,939
A conversation that took place five minutes
ago between the president and his wife.

289
00:27:41,021 --> 00:27:44,219
How could you possibly have
a recording of something like that?

290
00:27:44,302 --> 00:27:48,775
An agent named Jack Bauer
placed a listening device on the president.

291
00:27:49,344 --> 00:27:53,180
- Bauer? Isn't he the one under arrest?
- I'm going to play the recording now.

292
00:27:53,265 --> 00:27:55,257
I don't wanna listen to it. Ms O'Brian,

293
00:27:55,346 --> 00:27:59,819
at the least this is a violation of privacy,
and we're talking about the president!

294
00:27:59,908 --> 00:28:02,265
<i>Because you killed David Palmer.</i>

295
00:28:02,349 --> 00:28:06,822
<i>I told you, I didn't realise
that was going to happen.</i>

296
00:28:06,911 --> 00:28:12,033
<i>You... Your people killed him to protect
you. You covered it up, that's just as bad.</i>

297
00:28:12,113 --> 00:28:13,866
<i>I covered it up because I had to.</i>

298
00:28:13,954 --> 00:28:17,470
<i>- And others died to cover that up!
- For the good of the country.</i>

299
00:28:17,555 --> 00:28:22,153
<i>You sold nerve gas to terrorists.
You're insane. You're insane!</i>

300
00:28:22,478 --> 00:28:25,710
A poet once said, "No man is an island. "

301
00:28:26,358 --> 00:28:30,400
On a day like this,
we can feel the truth of those words.

302
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,915
Any untimely death is a tragedy,

303
00:28:33,001 --> 00:28:36,234
yet some men embody
such greatness of character

304
00:28:36,323 --> 00:28:42,275
that their death serves as a unifying force
for those who remain behind.

305
00:28:43,365 --> 00:28:46,085
David Palmer was such a man.

306
00:28:46,167 --> 00:28:50,161
A great president. A great American.

307
00:28:50,248 --> 00:28:53,161
And, on a more personal note,

308
00:28:53,249 --> 00:28:55,480
a wonderful friend.

309
00:28:56,211 --> 00:28:58,725
He'll be missed...

310
00:28:58,812 --> 00:29:00,325
Olson.

311
00:29:00,412 --> 00:29:02,404
Yes, sir.

312
00:29:03,614 --> 00:29:08,974
With all due respect, Mr. Attorney General,
are you sure this isn't some kinda mistake?

313
00:29:10,496 --> 00:29:12,328
Yes, sir.

314
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:14,534
I understand, sir.

315
00:29:14,618 --> 00:29:17,338
I'll do exactly as you say.

316
00:29:17,419 --> 00:29:23,371
...strength and moral courage, this country
might have not survived in its present form.

317
00:29:31,465 --> 00:29:36,494
It is very appropriate that David Palmer
will be laid to rest at Arlington cemetery,

318
00:29:36,586 --> 00:29:39,863
for he was a soldier in the truest sense.

319
00:29:42,029 --> 00:29:48,027
He was a man whose courage rose in direct
proportion to the threats his country faced.

320
00:29:56,034 --> 00:30:02,033
In closing, I would ask that the country
observe a national day of mourning

321
00:30:02,116 --> 00:30:07,398
for one of the greatest Americans
this nation will ever see.

322
00:30:07,478 --> 00:30:10,073
Thank you very much.

323
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,797
Thank you.

324
00:30:15,642 --> 00:30:17,395
Federal marshal. Come with us.

325
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:20,999
What the hell are you doing?
You came close to disrupting my speech.

326
00:30:21,084 --> 00:30:26,558
On behalf of President Logan,
I wish to thank you all for joining us.

327
00:30:27,286 --> 00:30:30,484
And, uh, I am sorry,
but out of respect for today's ceremony...

328
00:30:30,568 --> 00:30:33,163
Those are ridiculous accusations.

329
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:36,048
Excuse me. If I may, sir.

330
00:30:37,491 --> 00:30:42,043
You've probably never seen one of these,
Mr. President.

331
00:30:42,132 --> 00:30:44,601
It's a microtransmitter.

332
00:31:11,504 --> 00:31:14,736
Agent Clark, arrest these men
and get them the hell out of here.

333
00:31:14,825 --> 00:31:19,947
- Sorry, Mr. President. We have our orders.
- You take... You take your orders from me.

334
00:31:20,027 --> 00:31:22,417
Not any more.

335
00:31:23,508 --> 00:31:25,500
After you, sir.

336
00:32:08,526 --> 00:32:10,996
Watch your head, sir.

337
00:32:34,937 --> 00:32:37,372
Give me a second.

338
00:32:55,385 --> 00:32:57,580
- Hey.
- Hey.

339
00:33:00,386 --> 00:33:03,778
- Thank God you're safe.
- Everything's gonna be all right.

340
00:33:03,868 --> 00:33:05,779
I heard you kidnapped the president.

341
00:33:05,869 --> 00:33:10,227
I was just trying to get him
to give me a direct confession.

342
00:33:10,311 --> 00:33:11,505
Jack...

343
00:33:14,632 --> 00:33:17,909
How much longer do you need to stay here?

344
00:33:19,194 --> 00:33:22,471
Not much longer.
They can debrief me tomorrow.

345
00:33:22,556 --> 00:33:24,547
Are you sure?

346
00:33:39,242 --> 00:33:43,441
I can't believe you're really...
you're really here.

347
00:33:46,565 --> 00:33:50,764
Agent Bauer? Excuse me, but
there's a call for you from your daughter.

348
00:33:50,846 --> 00:33:52,485
- From my daughter?
- Yes, sir.

349
00:33:52,567 --> 00:33:56,005
Kim Bauer. It's been put through
to a landline just inside that door.

350
00:33:56,088 --> 00:33:58,080
Thank you.

351
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:03,367
I'll be right back, I promise.

352
00:34:03,452 --> 00:34:07,571
Take as long as you need.
I'm not going anywhere.

353
00:34:08,573 --> 00:34:11,772
I love you. I'll be right back.

354
00:34:23,499 --> 00:34:25,492
Hey, Kim.

355
00:34:59,161 --> 00:35:01,961
- Any word on Logan?
- No.

356
00:35:02,043 --> 00:35:06,880
My guess is he'll try to cut a deal. Resign
without a fight in exchange for clemency.

357
00:35:06,964 --> 00:35:08,523
He doesn't deserve clemency.

358
00:35:08,605 --> 00:35:13,397
The country doesn't deserve
a long impeachment process either.

359
00:35:13,487 --> 00:35:19,838
In any event, we can expect Hal Gardner
to be sworn in as president soon.

360
00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:22,570
So this'll probably be
the last time I see this place.

361
00:35:22,651 --> 00:35:24,608
I don't think so.

362
00:35:24,692 --> 00:35:30,371
Not if I have anything to do with it, and I will.
You'll be back here running CTU.

363
00:35:30,454 --> 00:35:33,367
Thank you. I appreciate that.

364
00:35:33,455 --> 00:35:37,609
When I came in here last night,
to save the day,

365
00:35:37,696 --> 00:35:42,453
I was a little bit condescending and tactless,
to say the least.

366
00:35:42,539 --> 00:35:46,419
I had no idea what you were up against.
I'm sorry.

367
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,890
No, no need to apologise.

368
00:35:48,981 --> 00:35:53,977
Mistakes were made.
You were right to come in with a firm hand.

369
00:35:55,704 --> 00:35:57,695
Well, I'd better go.

370
00:35:57,785 --> 00:35:59,616
Karen...

371
00:36:00,586 --> 00:36:05,537
I was thinking of, uh,
getting some breakfast before going home.

372
00:36:05,628 --> 00:36:10,829
I have to go over to Division
for one last briefing. Bureaucracy...

373
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:13,627
Rain check?

374
00:36:13,711 --> 00:36:15,828
Sure.

375
00:36:32,878 --> 00:36:35,189
Chloe.

376
00:36:35,879 --> 00:36:38,075
Really good work today.

377
00:36:38,161 --> 00:36:39,719
You too.

378
00:36:42,722 --> 00:36:45,921
I found this in Edgar's possessions.
I thought you should have it.

379
00:36:46,004 --> 00:36:47,915
Thanks.

380
00:37:11,214 --> 00:37:13,728
Hey.

381
00:37:14,335 --> 00:37:16,725
What's all this, then?

382
00:37:17,977 --> 00:37:20,775
A friend of mine who died today.

383
00:37:22,378 --> 00:37:24,369
You, um...

384
00:37:24,459 --> 00:37:26,928
Do you wanna talk about it?

385
00:37:31,021 --> 00:37:33,217
Yeah. Come on.

386
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:46,378
Jack?

387
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:55,341
Oh, my God.

388
00:37:55,431 --> 00:37:58,026
Agent Davies, Jack Bauer's missing.

389
00:37:58,112 --> 00:38:03,188
Attention, all units. We have a missing
agent - Jack Bauer. I repeat, Jack Bauer.

390
00:38:03,274 --> 00:38:09,272
You two men, search the lower levels.
Give me three men on a perimeter search.

391
00:38:47,611 --> 00:38:50,366
You surely must be aware, Mr. Bauer,

392
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:53,366
that China has a long memory.

393
00:38:53,454 --> 00:38:59,612
Only 18 months ago you invaded our territory
and killed our consul.

394
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:12,253
Did you really think
that we would forget? Hm?

395
00:39:14,942 --> 00:39:17,537
I know how this works.

396
00:39:20,785 --> 00:39:23,663
I need to make one phone call.

397
00:39:25,866 --> 00:39:27,859
Please.

398
00:39:30,548 --> 00:39:33,508
Just one phone call.

399
00:39:50,316 --> 00:39:52,308
Kill me.

400
00:39:53,838 --> 00:39:58,230
Just... kill me.

401
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,911
Kill you?

402
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,472
You're far too valuable to kill, Mr. Bauer.
