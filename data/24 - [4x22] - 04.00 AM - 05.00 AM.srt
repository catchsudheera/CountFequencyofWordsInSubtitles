1
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,594
- David, what have you done?
Excuse me?

2
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,196
I just got a call from the Secretary of State
about a covert action against the Chinese.

3
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,349
That's correct. I sanctioned it.

4
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,716
An attack on their consulate.
A military engagement.

5
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:26,869
A covert operation.

6
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,518
We marched on Chinese soil,

7
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:32,673
we kidnapped one of their nationals, and
in the process the Chinese consul was killed.

8
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,873
If we don't find that warhead
before it's deployed,

9
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,679
ten million Americans
could face annihilation.

10
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,433
We could be at war with a billion Chinese.

11
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,632
- Is he gonna make it?
- We'll do our best.

12
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,757
I just need him long enough
to get the information about Marwan.

13
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:51,709
I know, Jack. You made me aware of that
when you forced me to sacrifice Paul Raines.

14
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,279
I'm so sorry.

15
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,511
You made a choice that killed Paul
and I'm trying to deal with it.

16
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,556
We both have a job. Let's just do it.

17
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:02,436
I know he worked on the warhead.
Now he needs to tell us where it is.

18
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,229
He knows where Marwan might be.
A factory on Sixth.

19
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,711
They're looking for the warhead in their cities.

20
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,314
They have no idea that
it's going to be delivered by missile.

21
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,356
Start the sequence.

22
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,634
We're done here.

23
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,597
They can't stop us now.

24
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,755
I've been waiting for this.

25
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,031
You're too late.

26
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,269
Kill me.

27
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,839
That won't stop the missile.

28
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,911
Tony, can you see this?
- Yeah.

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,675
Can you get the source of the transmission?

30
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,672
No, it's on an encrypted uplink.
No way to trace it.

31
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,111
Have you got a lock on the missile?

32
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,589
Still trying to find it.
What about Marwan?

33
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:10,434
I'm gonna scan the building, then
bring him into CTU. Prep a holding room.

34
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,954
I'm going off com.
If you need me, get me on my cell.

35
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,439
<i>All right. </i>

36
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,796
Try and decode his files.
I'll prep a team to scan the building.

37
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,191
Unbelievable.

38
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,593
How did they manage to assemble a missile
capable of carrying a nuclear warhead?

39
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,035
S- series cruise missile. Stealth technology.

40
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,396
They smuggled it in piece by piece
and then assembled it on site.

41
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,268
If it's Stealth, we can't track it by radar.
What about targets?

42
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,430
Pull it up.

43
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,629
An S-series has a range of 1800 miles.

44
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:45,952
A warhead could be delivered from the
Midwest to anywhere in the continental US.

45
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,315
Those missiles travel at a speed of 600mph.

46
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,834
It could hit a target
on either coast in three hours.

47
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:54,993
That's assuming it's headed for the coast.
If not, it could hit its target any time.

48
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,919
No files. He just used this
to unscramble the downlink.

49
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,549
- What else did you find?
- Nothing. Just the laptop and the cellphone.

50
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,712
OK. Upload the SIM card to CTU.
See if any of it's traceable.

51
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,076
- You got it.
- This is Bauer.

52
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:14,870
This is Logan. I've been told a cruise missile
was launched containing a nuclear warhead.

53
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:19,397
Our military tracking device is doing all
they can to find the trajectory of the missile,

54
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:24,235
- but we don't have a lot to go on.
- What about Marwan? You think he'll break?

55
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:28,950
That won't be easy, sir. He's planned and
organised everything that's happened today.

56
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,511
- He's committed. He's prepared to die.
- I know you'll do your best. Keep me posted.

57
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,991
Yes, sir. I will.

58
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:40,955
Let the Joint Chiefs know. This should be
limited to the intelligence community only.

59
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,749
A nuclear missile was launched.
We have to assume Washington is its target.

60
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,956
- What are our options?
Not many.

61
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,793
Our priority is to establish
a continuity of government

62
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:53,156
and start a quiet evacuation
of government personnel in the city.

63
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:56,038
Bring the cabinet members
and the Speaker to the bunker.

64
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:01,831
Congress and Pentagon should be taken
to the mountain safety facility.

65
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:07,278
Mike, let them know that this is a category
one emergency. Tell them nothing more.

66
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,794
We can't afford an information leak.

67
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:14,829
David, the public needs to be warned.
Cities need to be evacuated.

68
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:18,879
Not yet. Let's see
what Bauer comes up with first.

69
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,313
- He'll die before he talks to us.
- I know.

70
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,877
Stand down.

71
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:39,516
You and I both know all I wanna do right now
is kill you, but I have my orders.

72
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,990
We've run out of time. You win.
I'm instructed to ask you what you want.

73
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,230
What I want is already happening.

74
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:49,950
The destruction of innocent life is a means
to an end. Why don't we just skip to the end?

75
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,359
To the end?

76
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,035
Everything you did today,
you did for a reason. For your people.

77
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,111
What do you want to change?

78
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:01,637
I have no interest in having
a political discussion with you.

79
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,870
I am in the position to make things happen.

80
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:07,589
I have the ear of the President
of the United States right now.

81
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,831
You have the power to make
any kind of deal that you want,

82
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:15,072
and I promise you, you'll do more for you
and your people if you cooperate with me

83
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,357
than if you let that missile hit its target.

84
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,477
You tell me where the missile's headed,
you help me stop it,

85
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:25,109
and I guarantee you that you will talk
to the president and he will listen.

86
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,077
He has no choice.

87
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:31,836
Right here, right now,
you have the chance to get what you want.

88
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,798
I already have, Agent Bauer.

89
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,714
After this day, every elected official
and citizen of America

90
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:44,909
will know that America cannot intervene
in our lives, in our countries, with impunity.

91
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,951
Besides, your president sees me
in only one dimension.

92
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,270
Evil.

93
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,111
As you see us.

94
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,235
Yes, and vulnerable.

95
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,953
- Chloe.
- What?

96
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,999
You'll never believe it. I got names
off the calls received on Marwan's cellphone.

97
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,798
Take a look.

98
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,151
- Richard Heller?
- Right. Secretary of Defense Heller's son.

99
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,390
Called Marwan a week ago.

100
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,675
Did you tell anyone yet?

101
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,635
No. Just you.

102
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,188
I'll let Buchanan know.

103
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,474
With every minute
the missile's target zone widens.

104
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,791
- We need to get updates from regional teams.
- Sorry to interrupt.

105
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:47,475
Edgar pulled a name off Marwan's phone
from a call he received last week.

106
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,279
- Who called him?
- Richard Heller.

107
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:56,432
- Are you sure?
- The number originated from his cellphone.

108
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,432
That's how Marwan knew
where Heller was yesterday morning.

109
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,398
- Richard helped plan the kidnap?
I don't know.

110
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:05,756
- Where is he now?
- Well, it's 4am. He's at home asleep, I guess.

111
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,751
- Where does he live?
- Van Nuys.

112
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:13,949
- Do we have field teams in the area?
- I don't know. I'll pull it up on the IP phone.

113
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,718
- Yes, we do.
- Dispatch them. I'll call Secretary Heller,

114
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,155
tell him his son's being brought back in.

115
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,549
Chloe, does Audrey know about this?

116
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:31,668
No. It's more of a management conversation,
don't you think?

117
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:36,311
Your team has been issued new orders.
You are to dispatch immediately to Van Nuys.

118
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,356
- Audrey, you got a minute?
- Yeah, sure. What is it?

119
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,352
- It's about your brother Richard.
- Is he all right?

120
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,591
- I assume he is, yeah.
- What do you mean?

121
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:55,269
We found out that Marwan got a call
from Richard's cellphone a week ago.

122
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,430
I'm sorry, but that's absurd.

123
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,990
We don't know what it means.
Buchanan sent a team to pick Richard up.

124
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,878
He was brought in once today
and he was cleared.

125
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:07,873
I know, but this call definitely
connects him to Marwan and the missile.

126
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:14,035
Look, I don't know how he got mixed up
in this, but my brother is not a terrorist.

127
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,231
Audrey.

128
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:24,594
Richard's phone number was found on
the received registry of Marwan's SIM card.

129
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:29,470
- Does my father know about this?
- Buchanan's calling him right now.

130
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,913
All right.

131
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,389
I'm sorry.

132
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:40,237
All right. I'll tell him. Yeah.
Jack, we got something.

133
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,995
- What?
- Richard Heller called Marwan a week ago.

134
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,472
- We're sure?
- Yeah. They're bringing him to CTU.

135
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,836
I wanna question this kid myself.
We need to get back there now.

136
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,194
Put the suspect in the vehicle.
We're headed back to CTU now.

137
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:00,317
It doesn't matter where you take me.

138
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,789
Yeah. We'll see about that.

139
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,991
- This is Bauer.
- Jack. Did you get anything out of Marwan?

140
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:25,473
No. We've got a better chance of breaking him
at CTU. We're about ten minutes out.

141
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:42,238
- Curtis, are you OK?
- Yes.

142
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,039
- Can you see the shooters?
- On the roof behind us.

143
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,792
Go!

144
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,678
Notify the perimeter
we no longer have Marwan in custody.

145
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:05,436
Perimeter teams, Marwan's escaped.
He's headed toward the southwest sector.

146
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,756
- What have you got on Marwan?
- Nothing.

147
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,479
He ditched the vehicle.
We can't find him on satellite.

148
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:33,270
- How did his people get into that area?
- They didn't. They must've been there before.

149
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:38,229
All right. Have perimeter teams comb
the nearby buildings for remaining hostiles.

150
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,880
- We lost them, Jack.
- Dammit, Tony, how?

151
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:44,919
They dumped their vehicle on the freeway.
Marwan got into another car.

152
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,992
We're trying to analyse the satellite.
The images are noisy.

153
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:53,029
- How does Buchanan wanna handle this?
- Finding Marwan is becoming less likely.

154
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,715
We have to follow primary leads only.
Right now that's Richard Heller.

155
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,395
- Has he arrived yet?
- No. He'll be back here momentarily.

156
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,914
Bill, I wanna interrogate this kid myself.

157
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,276
- I understand. I'll have him ready for you.
- We're on our way in.

158
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:11,036
Curtis, we need to get back to CTU. They lost
Marwan. We'll have to track him from there.

159
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,793
- What did Buchanan say?
- Heller's in first position.

160
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,189
We're gonna interrogate him.

161
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,831
Mr President.

162
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,478
Please, everybody, be seated.

163
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,675
I apologise for the abruptness
of your removal from your homes.

164
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:37,756
Please know that every precaution had to be
taken to ensure the secrecy of your arrival.

165
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,350
The US has been thrown
into a category one emergency.

166
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:45,876
A cruise missile containing
a nuclear warhead has been launched

167
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:51,512
and is now headed for, we believe, a major
US city, very possibly Washington, DC.

168
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,397
Now, all branches of the military
have been alerted.

169
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:59,314
They're doing everything in their power
to locate and intercept the missile.

170
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:04,030
Excuse me, sir. You're saying that not only
do we not know what the missile's target is,

171
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:07,192
- but you don't know where the missile is?
- That's correct.

172
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,748
When do you plan to inform the public?

173
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:15,278
At this time, we feel that informing the public
wouldn't be in the country's best interest.

174
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,158
"We" meaning who, Mr President?

175
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,076
I feel that way, Mr Speaker.

176
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:25,153
Doesn't the public have
a right to know the truth?

177
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:29,472
That's all I have for now.
When I know more, an update will be given.

178
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,835
Thank you. Excuse me.

179
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,639
Gentlemen.

180
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,996
Mr President.
- Yes, Don.

181
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:41,629
Sir, I do not wish to question your decision
in front of the cabinet,

182
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:46,396
but I think that you're making a grave mistake
in not alerting the public.

183
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:52,191
Look, I've thought a lot about this,
and... I'm certain it's the right course.

184
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:56,398
Well, if I may say so, sir,
you do not seem certain.

185
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:02,677
It's a difficult day for all of us, Don.

186
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,955
Now, if you'll excuse me...

187
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,270
Mike.

188
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,351
- What's going on here?
- Meaning what?

189
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,512
Logan was just sworn in.
We're under a terrorist attack.

190
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,511
He needs all the help he can get.

191
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,239
He understands that and he's seeking advice.

192
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:26,551
Not from his cabinet,
or the Congressional leadership.

193
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,437
Give it time, Don.

194
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,590
Give it time.

195
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,991
Thank you.

196
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,554
Tacticals are going
through Richard's things now.

197
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:49,553
- What about Jack?
- Jack and Curtis are on their way back.

198
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:53,633
Someone has to tell Audrey that Jack's
going to be interrogating her brother.

199
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:56,359
Audrey's not gonna wanna
let Jack near her brother.

200
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:01,230
It can't be helped. I mean, if Richard
knows something about that missile...

201
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:04,437
This morning, Jack and Audrey
were planning their future.

202
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:09,640
Now he's responsible for her husband's death
and he may have to torture her brother.

203
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:14,714
And yet every move he's made
has been the right one.

204
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,872
Not if he wanted to be with her.

205
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,676
Look, Michelle.

206
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,676
Everything that's happened here today...

207
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:33,238
it's been hard going through it
with you again.

208
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,550
It's been hard for me too.

209
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,397
And I...

210
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,359
look at what this job does
to the people in our positions,

211
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,510
and I realise...

212
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,075
I want us to be together again,

213
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:52,038
but it's gotta be away from all this.

214
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,669
You want us to leave our jobs?

215
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,709
We've spent the last 12 years
of our lives doing this.

216
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,597
Where would we go?

217
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,477
What would we do?

218
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,120
I don't care.

219
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:15,557
People start over every day,
if it's important to them.

220
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:21,277
You're asking me to leave
the only thing I've ever done.

221
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:26,315
Yes, I am.

222
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:40,350
This is beyond belief!
I cannot be back here!

223
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:44,115
Audrey, get me outta here! These guys
broke into my house. This is illegal.

224
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,839
Richard, listen.
Just calm down, OK? Listen to me.

225
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:49,559
Your number came up
on the cellphone of a terrorist.

226
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,995
That's what they said and that's insane!

227
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,957
- All right. Listen, OK?
- Audrey.

228
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:54,995
Yes.

229
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:59,073
- They have to get him into holding now.
- Audrey! Audrey, don't let them do this!

230
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,151
Don't let them do this to me!

231
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,879
- Who's interrogating him?
- Jack.

232
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,269
What?

233
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:11,992
- You are not gonna torture my brother.
- I'll be right in.

234
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:15,789
We're outta time. He knows something
and I'm gonna find out what it is.

235
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:19,429
- And what if he doesn't?
- You're aware that he called Marwan.

236
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:23,479
There has gotta be an explanation for that.
Let me talk to him.

237
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,233
You believe you can interrogate
your own brother?

238
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:32,395
Maybe I can get something out of him that
you can't. Please, just give me five minutes.

239
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,071
Please.

240
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,235
Take five minutes.

241
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,311
Thank you.

242
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,914
- Mike.
- Don.

243
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,118
- How's President Logan managing?
- Given the circumstances, very well.

244
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,430
I noticed that ex-president Palmer's here.

245
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:54,796
Yes. He brought
the former president in to advise.

246
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,189
Yeah, well, that's probably a good idea.

247
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:00,829
Palmer's been at the helm in this kind
of crisis. He knows how to lead.

248
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,718
President Logan doesn't
have any problem leading.

249
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:08,555
No, not at all. It's just that if he's not going
to ask his cabinet for help, or the leadership,

250
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,359
it comforts me somewhat

251
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,635
that he's in good hands.

252
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,757
- Is there something else you wanted to say?
- Yeah. Yeah, there is.

253
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:21,638
The people elected John Keeler
to run this country.

254
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,792
In his absence,
Logan is expected to take over,

255
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,111
but if he's not up to the task, Mike,
it is I, Speaker of the House,

256
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:31,272
and not David Palmer who steps up.

257
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:35,717
Understood.
And let me assure you that's not the case.

258
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:40,198
Logan is in complete control.

259
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:45,791
- Excuse me, Don. I gotta get back.
- Sure.

260
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,957
Excuse me, Mr President.

261
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,031
We may have a problem.

262
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,997
- What is it?
- Don Ashton.

263
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:03,473
He's been asking questions and raising
concerns as to President Palmer's role here.

264
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:07,235
That's too bad. We have more important
things to worry about at the moment.

265
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:11,552
Sir, as Speaker of the House he can create
problems which you don't need right now.

266
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,677
Mike's right, sir. Don's very ambitious.

267
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:19,390
Now that he's next in line to the presidency,
he'll look to exploit any angle he can.

268
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,869
He won't put ambition
before national security.

269
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,996
He won't see it in those terms, sir.

270
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:30,110
In his eyes, national security and his
personal ambition are one and the same.

271
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,070
What do we do?

272
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,993
Show him who's in charge.

273
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:01,438
- Everything set up?
- Yeah, he's ready.

274
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,556
Let's do this.

275
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,149
- Hey.
- Audrey!

276
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,549
Get me out! Tell them I didn't do anything!

277
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,030
Richard, I want you to listen to me
very carefully, OK?

278
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:21,069
A missile carrying a nuclear warhead
was launched by this man, Habib Marwan.

279
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:25,278
- Tell me what you know about him.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

280
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:29,672
CTU has proof that you called him last week.
Last Tuesday at four in the morning.

281
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,797
I don't know any Habib Marwan
or anything about a missile.

282
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,632
You have got to believe me.

283
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,439
That missile is in the air now
heading toward a city.

284
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:43,231
- Please, Richard, just tell me what you know.
- Look, I told you. I don't know anything.

285
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:49,270
- Why'd you make that phone call last week?
- I didn't make a phone call, Audrey.

286
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,991
What's happened with my son so far?

287
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:58,197
We decided to let Audrey talk to him first.
They just started.

288
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,716
- Has he confessed anything yet?
- No, sir.

289
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,072
Richard, it's not making sense.
That call was made.

290
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:10,393
Look, I don't know where you get
your information, Audrey, but it's all bull.

291
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:15,110
His readings are spiking.
He's holding something back.

292
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,598
Richard.

293
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:21,353
Richard, I am begging you
to talk to me, all right?

294
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:26,355
If you don't, there is a man who will come in
here and he will get the information from you.

295
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:29,079
I saw him torture someone today.

296
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:33,438
It's what he's trained to do. He won't stop
hurting you until you tell him the truth.

297
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,839
Please.

298
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,876
Don't let them do this to me.

299
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,316
Tell me what you know and they won't.

300
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,314
I don't know what you want from me. I don't.

301
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,868
Richard, look at me. Look at me.

302
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,635
We have a chance to fix this.

303
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,350
- <i>Audrey... </i>
This is not working.

304
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:55,876
We don't have time to coddle him. Open up.

305
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:00,319
I don't care if he is my son.
He's playing games now.

306
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:07,597
All right, Richard. This has gone far enough.
Either you tell us what we wanna know,

307
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:11,753
or I will let them use every piece
of equipment they have to drag it out of you.

308
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,990
<i>You understand that?</i>

309
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,038
- Dad, don't.
- Audrey, leave the room.

310
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,791
- Dad, please...
- Now!

311
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,075
I mean it.

312
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:27,915
- I want you to tell them everything you know.
- Don't let them do this to me.

313
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:39,117
- <i> Now, what's it gonna be, Richard?</i>
- <i>Go to hell. </i>

314
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,509
<i>I did nothing wrong. I don't have to tell you. </i>

315
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,878
There's a nuclear warhead gonna detonate
somewhere over this country.

316
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,679
Those lost lives will be on your head.

317
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,955
You will be a murderer!

318
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:55,079
I didn't mean to do anything wrong, I swear.

319
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:58,118
What did you do, Richard?
Tell me what you did.

320
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,590
Look, don't...

321
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:09,070
A week ago I was...

322
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:12,630
I was at a bar and...

323
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,235
and there was this girl and her boyfriend, OK?

324
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,833
All right.

325
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,593
- What were their names?
- I don't know.

326
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:24,353
They wanted to party and I... we...

327
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,069
we went back to my place.

328
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,349
We got high and then...

329
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,632
I guess...

330
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:39,474
there was time for one of them
to make a call on my phone.

331
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,471
How?

332
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,839
When we were in bed.

333
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:55,517
So, while you were in bed with her,
he used your phone in the other room?

334
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:00,554
He wasn't the one in the other room, Dad.

335
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,834
I was with him.

336
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:21,155
She must have been the one
that made the call.

337
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,795
<i>So you were set up. </i>

338
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,189
Yeah, I guess so, Dad.

339
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,469
Did they leave you with a number
or an address?

340
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,357
No.

341
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,999
What kind of a car were they driving?

342
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,753
They didn't have one. I drove.

343
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,116
Where did you drop them off afterwards?

344
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,273
- I didn't. They took a cab.
- You remember the name of the company?

345
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,635
<i>No, Dad, I don't. </i>

346
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:56,757
Get logbooks from every cab company
that works in the area.

347
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:59,798
- Get me a sketch artist now.
- I'll run it.

348
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:02,235
- Take over.
- Yes, sir.

349
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,755
So now you know.

350
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,796
I suppose you're even more disgusted
with me, huh, Dad?

351
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:15,237
This is not about how you choose
to live your life, son.

352
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:18,790
This is about how you put
this country in jeopardy.

353
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,793
If you had told us this yesterday, maybe
these attacks would not have occurred.

354
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,599
No. Don't you put that on me, Dad,

355
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:29,559
cos yesterday I didn't know that night
had anything to do with these attacks.

356
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:32,393
You should've told us everything.

357
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,310
I'll wait outside.

358
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:46,515
You made a profound mistake today, Richard.

359
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,829
Based on this information,
we can start to develop a contingency plan.

360
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:11,435
- You got the cab company?
- Better than that. We got the cab driver.

361
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,830
He dropped them off at an apartment complex
called the Mercerwood.

362
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:17,832
- Did you talk to the manager?
- We gave him a description.

363
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,354
- He knows what unit they're in.
- Jack, take this.

364
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,556
I'm gonna need Curtis and Castle.

365
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,474
- I need Curtis here with me.
- Then you gotta give me Tony.

366
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,356
All right. What about
the phone call to Marwan?

367
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:36,355
I analysed Richard's phone. The phone call
to Marwan activated a listen-in.

368
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:39,273
He was able to hear all of Richard's calls
after that night.

369
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,272
That's why Marwan knew
that Heller was visiting Richard.

370
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:46,797
- Anything on the missile?
- We've run military protocol. So far, nothing.

371
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,757
Is Logan gonna make an announcement?

372
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:53,709
As of now, the president still thinks
that would do more harm than good.

373
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,073
Please, as you were, everybody. Be seated.

374
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:02,832
Gentlemen and ladies,
considering the crisis that we face today,

375
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:06,230
I felt it prudent to enlist the assistance
of ex-president Palmer.

376
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,117
In what capacity?
- Excuse me?

377
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:11,317
Everybody in this room
has a title and specific function.

378
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:14,597
Exactly what position
will President Palmer be occupying?

379
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,671
I'm here solely as an advisor,

380
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:19,832
not only to the president
but to anyone who requests my counsel.

381
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:23,276
He is outside the chain of command,
if that's what you're asking.

382
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,079
Asking for a clarification, sir.

383
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:29,869
The missile carrying the warhead
was launched from a location in Iowa.

384
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:34,351
It's becoming more and more likely
that the target is on or near one of the coasts.

385
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:38,638
It's clearly going to be New York or DC.
Why aren't we evacuating those two cities?

386
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,029
I disagree, Jenny. It's not clear.

387
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,588
And if you start to evacuate these two cities,

388
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:48,310
then you may have an unauthorised
mass exodus of Boston, Philadelphia,

389
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,311
Baltimore, Atlanta...

390
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,994
The president shouldn't deal
with that situation.

391
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:55,674
Maybe the president
should tell us that himself.

392
00:26:55,760 --> 00:27:00,709
Please, Mr Speaker. I've discussed this option
with a number of domestic experts,

393
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:04,395
including President Palmer,
and that's my assessment as well.

394
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,789
What about air defence?
Are we gonna stand by

395
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,678
and let these cities' airspace
remain undefended?

396
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:13,196
We have a limited number
of F-18 interceptor jets at our disposal.

397
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,953
They need to be augmenting
the search for this missile

398
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,110
and not deployed in a "wait and see" mode.

399
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:21,909
Mr Palmer, I am sure that
we all appreciate your desire to help,

400
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,754
but the Constitution has determined
who the decision makers should be.

401
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:30,914
- I think you're overstepping your bounds.
- In the first place, it's "Mr President", Don.

402
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,468
You should address
the content of my statements.

403
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:36,028
David.

404
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:39,908
You are to be addressed as "President",
it's an expression of respect,

405
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,072
but not a functional title.

406
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:47,199
I understand that, but you have to understand
I've been through this crisis before.

407
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:52,673
Yes, but we are here now, the appointed
representatives of the people of the US.

408
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:56,673
- Mr President...
- There will be no more discussion on this.

409
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,035
Your point has been taken.

410
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:03,079
However, Ashton has made a good point
and I wanna address his concerns.

411
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:06,436
Perhaps it's best if I excuse myself.

412
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,794
Perhaps.

413
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,553
Ladies, gentlemen.

414
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:22,516
Mr Speaker, I think you're right. We're gonna
put those jets over DC and New York.

415
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:39,958
- Did you see it on the inside feed?
- Yes. It went exactly as you'd hoped.

416
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:43,510
We won't have any more problems
with Don Ashton today.

417
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:46,076
I hope you're right.

418
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,837
We'll monitor everything on three.

419
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:52,799
Make sure LAPD's there when we land.
We'll need transport to the site.

420
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,599
- They've already been called.
- OK.

421
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,032
Tony, wait.

422
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,476
I- I can't...

423
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:09,076
I can't spend another day without you.

424
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:13,039
I'm ready to leave here.
I'm ready to go with you.

425
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,829
Tony.

426
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,316
Be careful.

427
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,230
Right.

428
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,833
They're setting up a feed.

429
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:48,232
Richard will help Jack identify
the suspects when they get on site.

430
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,835
- Then what?
- Then they'll let him go.

431
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:55,356
His motives certainly weren't seditious.

432
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,116
Dad, I feel so lost.

433
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,877
I know, sweetheart.

434
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,518
Ms Raines.
- Yes.

435
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,875
Jack Bauer's on line two for you.

436
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,394
Thank you.

437
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:14,711
You take it, sweetheart. I'll be on the floor.

438
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,675
- <i>Hello. </i>
- Audrey, it's Jack.

439
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,513
I know you don't wanna talk,
but I need to say a few things.

440
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,033
All right.

441
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:44,156
I know with everything that's happened,

442
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:48,392
you've seen me do things that before now
you thought were unimaginable.

443
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,472
I would have been happy to skip today.

444
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,152
Yeah, me too.

445
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:59,348
But I never believed you could ever love me
if you'd known about everything I've done.

446
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,193
- Jack, I can't...
- <i>Audrey, please, let me finish. </i>

447
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:06,510
These were the things I was running
away from. That's why I moved to DC.

448
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,592
That's why I stopped doing field work,
why I don't work at CTU.

449
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:14,151
All I know is that you're back in it
and it's too much for me, Jack.

450
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,071
I know.

451
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,396
I know.

452
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:23,509
The last thing I ever wanted to do
was push you away from me.

453
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,670
God, Audrey, I love you.

454
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:29,318
But this is how the job has to be done.

455
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:36,710
I want you to know how sorry I am that it had
to involve you and the people you care about.

456
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:40,156
Look, you don't have to say anything now.

457
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:44,313
Please, just promise me
as soon as this is over,

458
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:48,313
we can talk about everything that's happened.

459
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:56,109
Audrey, please.

460
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,997
Jack.

461
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:01,629
<i>I'm gotta call you back later, OK?</i>

462
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,517
All right.

463
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,154
- Yeah.
- Tactical's got the schematic ready.

464
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:16,473
- What are the approach perimeters?
- They want us to go in from the west.

465
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,788
Edgar.

466
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,953
This is the composite the artist made based
on Richard's description. Get it to Jack.

467
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,110
Will do.

468
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:39,796
- Now can we go?
- We have plenty of time to get to Marwan.

469
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:42,110
I don't like cutting it this close.

470
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,753
This is a sketch of the guy
Richard Heller described.

471
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,718
He and the girl are our only leads
to finding Marwan,

472
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:40,156
so once we identify the suspects
it is vital we take them alive.

473
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:43,312
Manning.

474
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:46,676
Curtis, it's Jack. We're getting ready to land.
Is everything set?

475
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,910
Yeah. Richard's ready to make a positive ID.

476
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,719
Copy that. I want you to stay on this channel.

477
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:54,598
- You got it.
- We're a go.

478
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:19,954
I need you to make sure no LAPD units go
inside our established perimeter. Am I clear?

479
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:22,315
- Yes, sir.
- OK, let's go.

480
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,318
- Ready?
- They found us.

481
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:38,392
- What do you mean?
- A helicopter just landed a block away.

482
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,358
- So what?
- So, they found us.

483
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,792
- Dammit!
- Hey! We can't go together.

484
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:48,270
- Why not?
- One of us has to stay here in the apartment.

485
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,351
- Why?
- If they think we're still here,

486
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,476
it gives the other a chance to escape.

487
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:56,189
You gotta be joking. One of us
is gonna get caught to save the other?

488
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,475
Exactly. It's gonna be you.

489
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,035
Do you wanna move in
on the apartment now?

490
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:36,636
No. I want you and Castle to take up positions
here on the roof of the main building.

491
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,950
- Teams B and C, are you in position?
- <i>Team A set. </i>

492
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,679
- <i> Team C in position. </i>
- Copy that. Let's go.

493
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,954
LAPD, I need the entry code
for the south gate.

494
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:49,316
<i> It's: Star 4763458.</i>

495
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,431
I'm in.

496
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:11,112
OK, I've got a visual on the apartment.
There's activity inside.

497
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:14,749
McAllen, meet me at the door of
the apartment. Have your people cover us.

498
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:17,070
On my way. Go. Go.

499
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,950
Pick it.

500
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,437
OK.

501
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:18,679
Put your hands where I can see them.
Put your hands where I can see them now!

502
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,918
He's dead. Get a picture of him,
send it back to CTU.

503
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,956
- Got it.
- Tony, this is Jack.

504
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,600
- <i>Has anybody reported outside movement?</i>
- No. Why?

505
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:33,592
<i>The man is dead. </i>
<i>The girl is no longer in the apartment. </i>

506
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:36,558
- She couldn't get past the perimeter.
- <i>She could hide. </i>

507
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:40,553
All teams, maintain positions
until we search the other apartments.

508
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:41,436
<i>Roger that. </i>

509
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:46,551
- All teams, hold position.
- <i> Charlie, copy that. Holding steady. </i>

510
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,310
Drop your gun.

511
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,676
All right. All right.

512
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,955
Kick it away.

513
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:21,914
Look, he's injured. Why don't you let him go?
You can take me instead.

514
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,831
Your two-way.

515
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,788
Turn around.
On your knees, hands on your head.

516
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,510
Cuff him.

517
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,593
Get up.

518
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,630
Curtis, you should have it.

519
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,910
- Whoa.
Is that him? Is that him?

520
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,274
Yeah. Yeah.

521
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:38,035
Jack, that's him.
Richard gave us a positive ID on the picture.

522
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:40,554
OK. Thank you, Curtis. Tactical, this is Bauer.

523
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:43,632
I need five teams of two
to initiate a search of the complex.

524
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:47,952
Start with the outer buildings along
the perimeter. Move your way in.

525
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:50,918
Tony, this is Jack. We're initiating the search.

526
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,639
Tony, do you copy?

527
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:56,473
Castle, why is Almeida not on com?

528
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,956
<i> Tony, do you copy?</i>

529
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:06,110
<i>Tony, come in!</i>

530
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:39,234
All teams, this is Bauer. Castle is down.
Almeida is missing and possibly a hostage.

531
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:42,676
Our communications were compromised.
Move to secondary frequency.

532
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:45,558
CTU, I need more tactical personnel now.

533
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:48,998
<i>Michelle, did you copy that? Michelle!</i>

534
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:53,153
You heard him, people. Shift profiles.
We may have a hostage situation.

535
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:55,276
Move now!

536
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:18,991
