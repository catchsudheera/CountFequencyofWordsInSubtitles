2
00:00:40,051 --> 00:00:42,123
It's him.

3
00:00:50,658 --> 00:00:51,692
Damn it.

4
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,097
(over headset): I couldn't get off a shot.

5
00:00:54,165 --> 00:00:55,868
Stand by.

6
00:00:55,936 --> 00:00:57,839
We'll get him on the way out.

7
00:01:16,626 --> 00:01:18,627
Manuel!

8
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:23,801
Hey, Manny!

9
00:01:26,705 --> 00:01:28,707
Manny!

10
00:01:29,709 --> 00:01:31,711
(water running)

11
00:01:34,482 --> 00:01:37,850
Hey, Manny!

12
00:01:56,244 --> 00:01:58,613
(line ringing)

13
00:01:58,681 --> 00:01:59,614
WOMAN: Yes?

14
00:01:59,682 --> 00:02:00,749
Put Mauricio on the phone.

15
00:02:00,817 --> 00:02:02,819
Victor? Just put Mauricio on!

16
00:02:02,887 --> 00:02:03,921
He's dead.

17
00:02:03,988 --> 00:02:05,356
What?

18
00:02:05,424 --> 00:02:07,092
Someone shot him in the head.

19
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,761
What the hell is happening?

20
00:02:30,122 --> 00:02:31,489
I see him.

21
00:02:31,557 --> 00:02:33,024
He's leaving the building.

22
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,493
I'set.

23
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:43,196
Stop.

24
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:45,463
SPOTTER: It's not him.

25
00:02:45,531 --> 00:02:48,766
He can't be far.

26
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:00,775
(grunts)

27
00:03:02,978 --> 00:03:05,379
(engine starts)

28
00:03:07,516 --> 00:03:10,484
(tires squealing)

29
00:03:12,387 --> 00:03:13,988
Coming at you! Gray sedan!

30
00:03:18,427 --> 00:03:20,328
(tires squealing)

31
00:03:38,548 --> 00:03:40,483
Target is out of range.

32
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:42,550
Move out.

33
00:03:47,588 --> 00:03:48,721
(panting)

34
00:03:48,788 --> 00:03:49,989
OPERATOR: 911. What's your emergency?

35
00:03:50,056 --> 00:03:53,291
Yes. I want to report a stolen vehicle.

36
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:59,061
License plate SNE15C5.

37
00:03:59,129 --> 00:04:01,130
(upbeat music plays on TV)

38
00:04:06,936 --> 00:04:07,936
Jack?

39
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:14,175
Oh.

40
00:04:14,243 --> 00:04:17,378
Sweetheart, we already
talked about this, remember?

41
00:04:17,446 --> 00:04:19,046
You're supposed to call me "Grandpa."

42
00:04:19,114 --> 00:04:21,748
You don't look like a grandpa.

43
00:04:21,816 --> 00:04:23,383
(chuckling)

44
00:04:23,451 --> 00:04:24,851
Couldn't agree with you more.

45
00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:27,687
The cartoon I turned on is boring.

46
00:04:27,755 --> 00:04:29,756
Okay. We'll find another one.

47
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,728
This is the boldest diplomatic initiative

48
00:04:34,795 --> 00:04:36,262
we've seen in a generation.

49
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:38,731
It could finally lay a
foundation for real peace

50
00:04:38,799 --> 00:04:40,366
throughout the entire region.

51
00:04:40,433 --> 00:04:41,901
Well, you know, Bob, the president's

52
00:04:41,968 --> 00:04:43,169
certainly betting her legacy

53
00:04:43,237 --> 00:04:44,904
on the success of these negotiations...

54
00:04:44,972 --> 00:04:46,573
Grandpa!

55
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,375
This isn't a cartoon!

56
00:04:48,442 --> 00:04:49,609
Okay, okay.

57
00:04:51,446 --> 00:04:52,612
*A sloth of bears... âTª

58
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,345
This one! I like this one!

59
00:04:54,413 --> 00:04:57,111
*A mob of cows âTª

60
00:04:57,179 --> 00:04:58,212
*A herd of sheep... âTª

61
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:01,914
(making funny sounds)

62
00:05:01,981 --> 00:05:03,715
(phone rings)

63
00:05:05,117 --> 00:05:06,250
Yeah?

64
00:05:06,318 --> 00:05:08,185
Hi, Dad. Sorry we're late.

65
00:05:08,253 --> 00:05:09,586
They're redirecting everyone around the UN.

66
00:05:09,654 --> 00:05:11,088
It's all right. We're doing fine.

67
00:05:11,155 --> 00:05:12,389
How was the zoo?

68
00:05:12,456 --> 00:05:13,790
Well, to be honest with you,

69
00:05:13,857 --> 00:05:15,591
we spent most of our time
just going back and forth

70
00:05:15,659 --> 00:05:17,426
between the black bears and the polar bears.

71
00:05:17,494 --> 00:05:19,962
I forgot to mention that she's
going through a bear pha.

72
00:05:21,331 --> 00:05:22,764
Well, she certainly knows what she wants.

73
00:05:24,299 --> 00:05:25,533
She reminds me of you.

74
00:05:25,601 --> 00:05:26,900
Well, that's funny.

75
00:05:26,968 --> 00:05:29,169
I always tell Stephen how
much she reminds me of you.

76
00:05:29,237 --> 00:05:31,371
Anyway, we'll be there in a few minutes.

77
00:05:31,438 --> 00:05:32,538
Okay. Don't worry.

78
00:05:32,606 --> 00:05:34,073
We'll meet you in the lobby.

79
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,841
Great.

80
00:05:35,909 --> 00:05:38,143
Sounds like they had fun.

81
00:05:38,211 --> 00:05:40,812
They always do.

82
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:42,713
What's wrong?

83
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:46,082
We talked to him about moving
to LA the night we got here.

84
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:48,083
Yeah. He said he'd think about it.

85
00:05:48,151 --> 00:05:49,684
Yeah, and he hasn't mentioned
one word about it since.

86
00:05:49,752 --> 00:05:50,952
And we leave tonight.

87
00:05:51,019 --> 00:05:52,920
Well, maybe he has to
check with his doctors.

88
00:05:52,987 --> 00:05:54,621
No, they cleared him two weeks ag

89
00:05:54,689 --> 00:05:56,722
He's finished with treatme.

90
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,223
I don't know.

91
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:01,125
My father has been on his own for so long.

92
00:06:01,193 --> 00:06:03,327
Maybe he doesn't know how
to live any other way.

93
00:06:03,394 --> 00:06:04,827
Why don't you just ask him again?

94
00:06:04,895 --> 00:06:09,064
My father is not the type
of person you ask twice.

95
00:06:09,131 --> 00:06:10,931
If you want, I can do it.

96
00:06:17,503 --> 00:06:19,170
<i>REPORTER: Here at e ited Nions,</i>

97
00:06:19,238 --> 00:06:21,772
<i>a White House spokesman just confirmed that
Presiden</i>

98
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,140
Taylor and Hassan will be
hoing a joint press conference

99
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:25,541
later this hour.

100
00:06:25,609 --> 00:06:28,444
It is widely expected that
President Hassan will announce

101
00:06:28,511 --> 00:06:30,779
the dismantling of his country's
nuclear weapons program.

102
00:06:30,847 --> 00:06:34,818
esident Hassan has stated that
he conside these negotiations

103
00:06:34,885 --> 00:06:38,823
a historic success and a new
beginning for his country

104
00:06:38,891 --> 00:06:40,592
and the entire Mideast region.

105
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:43,997
I believe that that is a
reasonable compromise.

106
00:06:44,065 --> 00:06:47,768
Now, Mr. President, let's move
on to the issue of verification.

107
00:06:47,835 --> 00:06:51,906
Now, the language in your
latest proposal is vague.

108
00:06:51,974 --> 00:06:53,808
Let me be clear.

109
00:06:53,876 --> 00:06:55,443
My country agrees

110
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:58,111
to abandon the pursuit of nuclear weapons

111
00:06:58,179 --> 00:07:02,047
with full International Atomic
Energy Agency safeguards.

112
00:07:02,115 --> 00:07:04,382
But our terms, Mr. President,

113
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:07,284
were that the inspectors
themselves would be American,

114
00:07:07,352 --> 00:07:08,752
not IAEA.

115
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:10,318
With respect, Madam President,

116
00:07:10,386 --> 00:07:12,851
your side pushed the point,
but we never conceded.

117
00:07:12,919 --> 00:07:16,854
With respect, your side
has refused to negotiate

118
00:07:16,922 --> 00:07:18,789
the point in good faith.

119
00:07:18,857 --> 00:07:20,190
Without Americans on the ground--

120
00:07:20,258 --> 00:07:21,991
Surely, we're not going
to let the nationality

121
00:07:22,059 --> 00:07:23,125
of a few hundred men--

122
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:24,793
...verification has no teeth.

123
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:27,462
So, only the United States can
be trusted, Mr. Secretary?

124
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:30,698
This is the message that you
sent to the rest of the world

125
00:07:30,766 --> 00:07:31,999
and then you wonder why we
don't want to negotiate.

126
00:07:32,067 --> 00:07:34,535
Farhad.

127
00:07:34,603 --> 00:07:36,470
Madam President,

128
00:07:36,538 --> 00:07:38,071
please excuse my brother's passion.

129
00:07:38,139 --> 00:07:40,207
He only wants what is best for our country.

130
00:07:40,274 --> 00:07:41,910
I understand.

131
00:07:41,978 --> 00:07:43,712
But we need to resolve this issue

132
00:07:43,779 --> 00:07:44,912
before we can move forward.

133
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:47,080
And ideally, before

134
00:07:47,148 --> 00:07:49,516
the press conference, which gives us

135
00:07:49,584 --> 00:07:50,885
less than an hour.

136
00:07:50,952 --> 00:07:52,386
HASSAN: Madame President...

137
00:07:53,856 --> 00:07:55,524
what would your Congress say

138
00:07:55,591 --> 00:07:57,492
if my Revolutionary Guard

139
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,561
was stationed on your soil?

140
00:08:01,963 --> 00:08:03,330
It's the same with my

141
00:08:03,398 --> 00:08:05,232
National Assembly.

142
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:08,268
Even if I agreed to this,
they would not ratify it.

143
00:08:09,937 --> 00:08:11,337
After all, I'm not a king.

144
00:08:11,405 --> 00:08:13,105
Nor I a queen.

145
00:08:13,173 --> 00:08:15,907
Too bad for both of us.

146
00:08:18,477 --> 00:08:19,944
I'd like to adjourn

147
00:08:20,011 --> 00:08:22,445
and discuss this issue
with our respective teams.

148
00:08:22,513 --> 00:08:24,013
Of course.

149
00:08:36,322 --> 00:08:38,556
You are aware he was a salesman
before entering politics.

150
00:08:38,624 --> 00:08:40,691
Household appliances.

151
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:44,327
You want to bet he sold
a lot of refrigerators?

152
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:48,730
Find a way to give him what he wants.

153
00:08:48,798 --> 00:08:50,765
Madam President...

154
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:52,133
You heard me.

155
00:08:52,201 --> 00:08:54,570
Try to make the inspections work.

156
00:08:56,007 --> 00:08:57,975
This man is a once in a lifetime leader.

157
00:08:58,043 --> 00:08:59,276
And he has already

158
00:08:59,344 --> 00:09:01,847
suspended his support for
terrorist organizations,

159
00:09:01,915 --> 00:09:03,549
and privately, he's advocating

160
00:09:03,617 --> 00:09:05,250
for a two-state solution.

161
00:09:05,318 --> 00:09:08,019
How much further can we expect
him to stick his neck out?

162
00:09:19,696 --> 00:09:21,697
(elevator bell dings)

163
00:09:25,301 --> 00:09:27,669
Hey, come here.

164
00:09:27,737 --> 00:09:28,770
Did you name him yet? Bear.

165
00:09:28,838 --> 00:09:30,305
"Bear." KIM: There she is.

166
00:09:30,372 --> 00:09:32,607
Go get your mom. Hi!

167
00:09:32,674 --> 00:09:33,807
(laughing)

168
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:36,677
Hey! I heard that you

169
00:09:36,744 --> 00:09:39,246
and Grandpa were hanging out with the bears.

170
00:09:39,313 --> 00:09:41,414
Then we had ice cream,

171
00:09:41,482 --> 00:09:43,349
but I didn't like mine, so Grandpa

172
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:45,584
gave me his.

173
00:09:45,652 --> 00:09:46,785
That's nice. STEPHEN: Here, I got her.

174
00:09:46,853 --> 00:09:48,620
Thanks for watching her, Jack. Of course.

175
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:52,523
Listen, I've been thinking a lot about

176
00:09:52,591 --> 00:09:54,491
what we talked about.

177
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:56,059
And I've made up my mind.

178
00:09:56,127 --> 00:09:58,194
I want to move back to Los Angeles with you.

179
00:09:58,262 --> 00:10:00,196
Really? Yeah.

180
00:10:00,264 --> 00:10:02,231
I got a friend who's got
a private security firm.

181
00:10:02,299 --> 00:10:03,532
Said he'd give me some consulting work.

182
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,966
He's also got a place I can rent.

183
00:10:05,034 --> 00:10:06,535
Dad, I don't know what to say.

184
00:10:06,602 --> 00:10:08,503
Come here.

185
00:10:09,838 --> 00:10:10,971
You don't have to say anything.

186
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:12,473
Just give me a ride to the airport tonight.

187
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,807
Wait, you're coming with us tonight?

188
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:15,141
If it's okay.

189
00:10:15,209 --> 00:10:16,309
Of course. Stephen.

190
00:10:16,377 --> 00:10:18,210
Yeah? He's coming with us tonight.

191
00:10:18,278 --> 00:10:19,845
And I've just got a few more things to pack.

192
00:10:19,912 --> 00:10:22,680
I don't have very much.
I can be at your hotel in about an hour.

193
00:10:22,748 --> 00:10:24,283
That's perfect. We can get back
and finish packing ourselves.

194
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:25,684
It'll be all right if I fly back

195
00:10:25,751 --> 00:10:26,685
to Los Angeles with you?

196
00:10:26,752 --> 00:10:29,687
Yay! Yay!

197
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,321
Come on. I'll walk you to the car.

198
00:10:31,389 --> 00:10:33,389
Okay. Let's go.

199
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,359
Yay! I got her.

200
00:10:38,426 --> 00:10:41,428
Okay. *We're going in the car. âTª

201
00:10:48,167 --> 00:10:50,468
Get your belt done up...

202
00:10:54,303 --> 00:10:56,405
Dad, I am so glad that you're doing this.

203
00:10:56,473 --> 00:10:57,606
Me, too.

204
00:10:57,674 --> 00:10:59,942
I love you. Love you.

205
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:01,377
Okay, guys, I'll see you in an hour.

206
00:11:01,445 --> 00:11:03,313
TERI: Okay. Bye, sweetheart.

207
00:11:03,381 --> 00:11:04,414
TERI: Bye!

208
00:11:13,593 --> 00:11:15,394
(gasps, groans)

209
00:11:35,869 --> 00:11:37,436
Good afternoon, everyone.

210
00:11:37,504 --> 00:11:39,371
Good afternoon.

211
00:11:39,439 --> 00:11:42,308
All right, just a few things
before we get started here.

212
00:11:42,376 --> 00:11:44,977
Presidents Taylor and Hassan
will each make a statement

213
00:11:45,045 --> 00:11:46,112
after they've been introduced

214
00:11:46,179 --> 00:11:47,146
by the Secretary-General.

215
00:11:47,214 --> 00:11:48,481
The Q&A will follow,

216
00:11:48,549 --> 00:11:50,749
but I want you to keep your
questions strictly on topic.

217
00:11:50,816 --> 00:11:52,183
For obvious reasons, we're all operating

218
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,750
under heightened security measures,

219
00:11:53,818 --> 00:11:55,885
so, unless you've been dying to know

220
00:11:55,953 --> 00:11:57,320
what a chokehold feels like,

221
00:11:57,387 --> 00:11:59,121
keep your credentials visible at all times.

222
00:11:59,189 --> 00:12:00,488
All right?

223
00:12:00,556 --> 00:12:01,723
That's all for now.

224
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:03,891
(reporters murmuring)

225
00:12:07,329 --> 00:12:10,665
Meredith Reed, press.

226
00:12:10,733 --> 00:12:12,133
It's invalid.

227
00:12:12,201 --> 00:12:14,069
What?

228
00:12:14,136 --> 00:12:16,271
It can't be invalid.

229
00:12:16,339 --> 00:12:17,606
Can you double check?

230
00:12:17,673 --> 00:12:20,540
I did, ma'am. Your credentials
have been revoked.

231
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,274
Revoked by whom?

232
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:23,842
I don't have that information.

233
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:26,011
Okay, this has to be some sort of mistake.

234
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:28,012
You do remember me.
I've been here every day.

235
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,648
Please step aside, ma'am.

236
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:43,457
I just talked to Secretary of State Kanin.

237
00:12:43,525 --> 00:12:46,859
He's agreed to IAEAnspectors.

238
00:12:46,927 --> 00:12:48,493
That's good news.

239
00:12:48,561 --> 00:12:50,325
There is a condition attached.

240
00:12:50,393 --> 00:12:51,760
They're insisting

241
00:12:51,828 --> 00:12:53,995
that the head of the
verification team be an American.

242
00:12:56,698 --> 00:12:58,465
I think we can live with that, don't you?

243
00:12:58,533 --> 00:13:00,100
You know where I stand.

244
00:13:00,168 --> 00:13:02,803
We've already surrendered too
much in the name of peace.

245
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:05,705
Surrender is a strong word, Farhad.

246
00:13:05,772 --> 00:13:08,407
And what have we surrendered really,

247
00:13:08,474 --> 00:13:10,475
apart from our nuclear ambition?

248
00:13:10,543 --> 00:13:12,276
Isn't that enough?

249
00:13:12,344 --> 00:13:14,244
Spinning 6,000 centrifuges

250
00:13:14,312 --> 00:13:15,846
is good for political maneuvering,

251
00:13:15,914 --> 00:13:18,281
but it's helping to bankrupt our country.

252
00:13:18,349 --> 00:13:20,050
The truth is,

253
00:13:20,117 --> 00:13:22,118
we are not the ones being so generous.

254
00:13:22,186 --> 00:13:25,020
President Taylor is lifting
economic sanctions,

255
00:13:25,088 --> 00:13:27,623
and offering an aid package
worth billions of dollars.

256
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:29,524
We got everything we wanted, Farhad.

257
00:13:29,592 --> 00:13:31,693
As long as it's not a trick.

258
00:13:31,761 --> 00:13:34,062
(phone ringing)

259
00:13:35,897 --> 00:13:37,831
Hello.

260
00:13:37,899 --> 00:13:42,669
Hi. I'm sorry to bother you
with something so mundane,

261
00:13:42,737 --> 00:13:45,672
but I'm stuck outside.

262
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:47,074
Stuck?

263
00:13:47,141 --> 00:13:48,739
My press credentials

264
00:13:48,806 --> 00:13:51,507
have been revoked.

265
00:13:51,575 --> 00:13:52,741
I dI'll take care of it.

266
00:13:52,809 --> 00:13:54,009
Are you sure?

267
00:13:54,077 --> 00:13:55,143
Of course.

268
00:13:55,211 --> 00:13:57,311
Thank you.

269
00:13:57,379 --> 00:14:00,513
Will you, uh, will you still have
time for the interview later?

270
00:14:00,581 --> 00:14:03,349
Yes. After the press conference.

271
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:04,983
I'm looking forward to it, Mr. President.

272
00:14:05,051 --> 00:14:06,817
So am I.

273
00:14:10,154 --> 00:14:12,555
Reinstate Miss Reed's clearance.

274
00:14:12,623 --> 00:14:14,089
I was only...

275
00:14:14,157 --> 00:14:15,423
Just do it.

276
00:14:15,491 --> 00:14:18,593
Omar, people are starting to talk

277
00:14:18,661 --> 00:14:20,028
about you and this reporter.

278
00:14:20,095 --> 00:14:22,196
And saying what?

279
00:14:22,264 --> 00:14:24,065
Miss Reed is a journalist

280
00:14:24,132 --> 00:14:25,867
and she's profiling me for her newspaper.

281
00:14:25,934 --> 00:14:27,434
But you have feelings for her.

282
00:14:27,502 --> 00:14:28,902
I'm friendly with her.

283
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:31,270
Think whatever you like.

284
00:14:31,338 --> 00:14:34,540
This woman poses no threat
to me or the peace process.

285
00:14:34,608 --> 00:14:37,510
Not here maybe, but back in our country

286
00:14:37,577 --> 00:14:39,578
you'll be torn apart.

287
00:14:39,646 --> 00:14:42,580
The mullahs will say that you
have been corrupted by the West.

288
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:43,748
What do you say, Farhad?

289
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:45,349
Have I?

290
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:47,218
Have I been corrupted by the West?

291
00:14:47,285 --> 00:14:49,753
You know I don't believe that.

292
00:14:49,821 --> 00:14:52,622
But you are married.

293
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:55,959
Dalia hasn't been a wife
to me for a long time.

294
00:14:56,027 --> 00:14:57,193
That's no excuse to be reckless.

295
00:14:57,261 --> 00:14:59,428
I've done nothing reckless.

296
00:14:59,495 --> 00:15:03,698
I've done nothing reckless.

297
00:15:03,766 --> 00:15:07,101
Just reinstate Miss Reed's clearance now.

298
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:10,170
I'll see to it.

299
00:15:20,546 --> 00:15:22,313
(knocking on door)

300
00:15:36,692 --> 00:15:38,258
Victor.

301
00:15:38,326 --> 00:15:40,060
What are you doing here?

302
00:15:40,127 --> 00:15:41,894
How the hell did you find me?

303
00:15:41,962 --> 00:15:43,595
I was always resourceful, Jack.

304
00:15:43,663 --> 00:15:45,730
That's what you liked about me. Get in here.

305
00:15:45,798 --> 00:15:47,998
Take a seat.

306
00:15:48,066 --> 00:15:49,600
What happened?

307
00:15:49,668 --> 00:15:51,069
I need help.

308
00:15:51,136 --> 00:15:52,169
You need an ambulanc

309
00:15:52,237 --> 00:15:53,503
No, no, don't call.

310
00:15:53,571 --> 00:15:55,004
That's what he's waiting for.

311
00:15:55,072 --> 00:15:57,173
He's listening to the emergencchannels. Who?

312
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,008
Just listen to me, Jack. I have information.

313
00:15:59,075 --> 00:16:01,676
The best I can do for you, Victor,
is get you an ambulance.

314
00:16:01,744 --> 00:16:03,912
I'm out. I don't work for
the government anymore.

315
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,180
Oh, this you're going to want to hear.

316
00:16:05,248 --> 00:16:07,183
Why?

317
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:10,418
Why? Because you're the guy who
always does the right thing.

318
00:16:10,486 --> 00:16:12,786
(gasping rapidly)

319
00:16:12,854 --> 00:16:14,687
There's a big hit going down.

320
00:16:14,755 --> 00:16:15,821
On who?

321
00:16:15,889 --> 00:16:16,822
President Hassan at the UN.

322
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:17,823
He's getting taken out.

323
00:16:17,891 --> 00:16:20,093
When? Today.

324
00:16:20,194 --> 00:16:21,795
Before he can sign this thing with Taylor.

325
00:16:21,863 --> 00:16:24,263
(panting)

326
00:16:24,331 --> 00:16:26,632
You see? I told you you'd be interested.

327
00:16:26,699 --> 00:16:28,033
How do you know this?

328
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,167
I'm the one that got the
hitter into the country.

329
00:16:30,235 --> 00:16:31,768
I've been setting him up with what he needs.

330
00:16:31,836 --> 00:16:33,202
And then he tried to take you out.

331
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:34,770
Look, Jack, you're the only one

332
00:16:34,838 --> 00:16:36,539
at CTU I ever did business with.

333
00:16:36,606 --> 00:16:38,809
I need you to call them, vouch for me,

334
00:16:38,877 --> 00:16:41,145
so I can cut a deal.

335
00:16:41,213 --> 00:16:42,380
Come on, Jack.

336
00:16:42,448 --> 00:16:43,781
(groans) Keep your seat.

337
00:16:43,849 --> 00:16:45,283
Look, I swear, this is real.

338
00:16:45,351 --> 00:16:46,817
Someone is trying to make sure

339
00:16:46,885 --> 00:16:48,286
that this peace agreement does not happen.

340
00:16:48,354 --> 00:16:51,990
I'm not doing anything until
you give me your weapon.

341
00:16:52,057 --> 00:16:54,491
(panting)

342
00:16:56,928 --> 00:16:59,029
(groans) Better not be screwing with me.

343
00:16:59,096 --> 00:17:00,330
I'm not. I swear, I'm not.

344
00:17:00,397 --> 00:17:01,798
Who's the hitter? What's his name?

345
00:17:01,866 --> 00:17:02,932
Who's the hitter?!

346
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,200
I don't know his name.

347
00:17:04,268 --> 00:17:05,801
He's Russian or something. Not good enough.

348
00:17:05,869 --> 00:17:07,536
Who is the hitter?! Look.

349
00:17:07,604 --> 00:17:11,240
I know how to find him and stop
him before he makes the hit.

350
00:17:11,308 --> 00:17:14,744
But I'm not saying another
word until I make my deal.

351
00:17:14,812 --> 00:17:17,480
(panting)

352
00:17:17,548 --> 00:17:19,548
You're lucky I'm retired.

353
00:17:41,469 --> 00:17:43,502
This is Cole Ortiz.

354
00:17:43,569 --> 00:17:45,169
Move Singer's team to the northeast

355
00:17:45,236 --> 00:17:46,837
quadnt, and tell him, from now on,

356
00:17:46,905 --> 00:17:48,373
I want updates every quarter hour.

357
00:17:48,441 --> 00:17:50,674
Get back to me with confirmations.

358
00:17:50,742 --> 00:17:52,342
Hastings wants you to
expand the patrol perimeter

359
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:53,610
around the UN another quarter mile.

360
00:17:53,678 --> 00:17:54,811
I'm glad that's what he wants,

361
00:17:54,879 --> 00:17:56,412
but I barely have enough men to cover

362
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,646
the perimeter now.

363
00:17:57,714 --> 00:17:59,915
I'll see if I can get
NYPD to help you cover.

364
00:17:59,982 --> 00:18:01,750
Uh, Dana?

365
00:18:01,817 --> 00:18:03,684
My sister--

366
00:18:03,751 --> 00:18:05,818
she said she lt you a couple of messages.

367
00:18:05,886 --> 00:18:06,952
Something about bridesmaids' dresses.

368
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,286
I told her there was probably

369
00:18:08,354 --> 00:18:09,387
something wrong with your voicemail.

370
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:10,855
I got her messages.

371
00:18:10,922 --> 00:18:12,856
I just haven't had a chance.
These double shifts...

372
00:18:12,924 --> 00:18:14,624
I revised the patrol protocols at the UN.

373
00:18:14,692 --> 00:18:16,092
Thought you might like

374
00:18:16,159 --> 00:18:17,593
to take a look at it before
I distributed it. Yeah.

375
00:18:17,661 --> 00:18:19,261
Yeah, I do. I will call your sister

376
00:18:19,329 --> 00:18:20,429
back, I promise.

377
00:18:20,496 --> 00:18:22,063
Thanks.

378
00:18:25,167 --> 00:18:27,902
Damn it, what is the problem?

379
00:18:29,538 --> 00:18:31,105
Percussive maintenance?

380
00:18:31,173 --> 00:18:32,573
That's what my network apps professor

381
00:18:32,608 --> 00:18:34,275
called it when I hit my computer.

382
00:18:34,343 --> 00:18:35,810
Can I help?

383
00:18:35,878 --> 00:18:37,645
I just got the revised attendee list

384
00:18:37,713 --> 00:18:39,213
for the press conference.
I can't get the facial

385
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,547
recognition done in time.

386
00:18:40,615 --> 00:18:43,050
Oh, you're running each
person through individually.

387
00:18:43,117 --> 00:18:44,251
You can do them in a batch.

388
00:18:44,318 --> 00:18:46,386
Not if the data's in different formats.

389
00:18:46,454 --> 00:18:47,854
Well, that used to be true, but here.

390
00:18:52,827 --> 00:18:56,162
Like I said, there's no reon
to be shy out asking for help.

391
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:58,297
Okay? Don't worry.

392
00:18:58,365 --> 00:18:59,632
You'll catch u You're doing great.

393
00:18:59,699 --> 00:19:00,866
(phone ringing)

394
00:19:00,934 --> 00:19:02,134
Excuse me.

395
00:19:03,702 --> 00:19:04,802
O'Brian.

396
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:05,969
Chloe, it's Jack.

397
00:19:06,037 --> 00:19:07,270
Jack.

398
00:19:07,338 --> 00:19:08,972
How's Kim? Did you tell her about LA?

399
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,273
Yeah, but I can't go into that right now.

400
00:19:10,341 --> 00:19:11,440
I need to speak to the director.

401
00:19:11,508 --> 00:19:14,041
Mr. Hastings is on the phone,

402
00:19:14,076 --> 00:19:16,275
and he really doesn't
like to be interrupted.

403
00:19:16,343 --> 00:19:17,609
Well, tell him it's regarding a plot

404
00:19:17,677 --> 00:19:18,609
to assassinate President Has

405
00:19:18,677 --> 00:19:20,242
See if that ts his attention.

406
00:19:20,309 --> 00:19:22,309
Oh. Okay, hold on.

407
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:32,284
All right, now,
give me an overlay on the UN,

408
00:19:32,352 --> 00:19:33,785
view from the west.

409
00:19:33,853 --> 00:19:37,154
Now, overlay the distribution
of security teams, please.

410
00:19:37,222 --> 00:19:40,023
That looks good.

411
00:19:40,091 --> 00:19:43,292
Now, give me a comp with
incident reports and

412
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,861
satellite imaging. Excuse me, Mr. Hastings.

413
00:19:45,929 --> 00:19:48,163
Gary, hold on for a second.

414
00:19:48,231 --> 00:19:50,098
Jack Bauer's on line three. He says he nds

415
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:52,000
to talk to you. Bauer?

416
00:19:52,068 --> 00:19:53,434
It's about a plot against President Hassan.

417
00:19:53,469 --> 00:19:55,036
I thought you'd want to take the call.

418
00:19:57,105 --> 00:19:59,673
Gary, I'll call you back.

419
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:03,709
Mr. Bauer, thiss Brn Hastgs.

420
00:20:03,777 --> 00:20:05,978
Mr. Hastings, I'm with an
informant that I used to run

421
00:20:06,046 --> 00:20:07,446
who's claiming he's got
intel on an assassination

422
00:20:07,514 --> 00:20:08,847
attempt on President Hassan.

423
00:20:08,915 --> 00:20:10,716
He says it's going to take place today.

424
00:20:10,783 --> 00:20:11,883
We've received several ats

425
00:20:11,951 --> 00:20:13,218
in regard to the peace conference.

426
00:20:13,285 --> 00:20:14,385
I can only imagine.

427
00:20:14,453 --> 00:20:15,553
My informant's name Victor Aruz.

428
00:20:15,621 --> 00:20:16,821
I used him in the Salazar op.

429
00:20:16,888 --> 00:20:18,656
You should be able to
pull his file Pull it up.

430
00:20:18,723 --> 00:20:20,657
He's been shot in the arm-
he claims byhe assassin.

431
00:20:20,725 --> 00:20:21,992
Look, I don't think

432
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,960
this is something you should take lightly.

433
00:20:24,028 --> 00:20:27,730
And what does Mr. Aruz want
in return for his information?

434
00:20:27,798 --> 00:20:29,665
CTU protection and immunity.

435
00:20:29,733 --> 00:20:32,133
That's a lot to ask, Mr. Bauer.

436
00:20:32,201 --> 00:20:33,434
Have you pulled his file yet?

437
00:20:34,636 --> 00:20:36,336
No. JACK: Mr. Hastings,

438
00:20:36,404 --> 00:20:38,905
I know this son of a bitch,
and my instinct is telling me

439
00:20:38,972 --> 00:20:40,506
that you need to pay attention to this.

440
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:43,074
I need more than your instinct, Mr. Bauer.

441
00:20:43,142 --> 00:20:45,578
CTU isn't the organization you knew.

442
00:20:45,645 --> 00:20:47,580
Okay, fine, but understand this:

443
00:20:47,648 --> 00:20:49,181
If anything happens to President Hassan,

444
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:51,550
I will be obligated to call
President Taylor and tell her

445
00:20:51,618 --> 00:20:53,485
that I tried to provide you with this intel,

446
00:20:53,553 --> 00:20:56,187
and you ignored it.

447
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:57,989
What is taking so long for the file?

448
00:20:58,056 --> 00:21:00,257
Sorry. I'm still searching
through the archives.

449
00:21:00,324 --> 00:21:02,592
Mr. Hastings, I need your answer now.

450
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:04,593
Are you bringing Aruz in or not?

451
00:21:04,661 --> 00:21:06,661
(sighs)

452
00:21:08,664 --> 00:21:10,397
Let me talk to him.

453
00:21:10,465 --> 00:21:12,865
I'll put you on speaker.

454
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,166
Go ahead.

455
00:21:14,233 --> 00:21:16,868
Mr. Aruz, I'm gonna need some other details

456
00:21:16,936 --> 00:21:18,336
to corroborate your story.

457
00:21:18,403 --> 00:21:19,970
The hitter took out two of my guys.

458
00:21:20,038 --> 00:21:21,171
Manuel Escobar and Mauricio Tellez.

459
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:22,238
Check with t cops.

460
00:21:22,306 --> 00:21:24,073
We will.

461
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:25,574
Mr. Bauer,

462
00:21:25,641 --> 00:21:26,741
where are you?

463
00:21:26,809 --> 00:21:28,242
1145 West 18th.

464
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:30,343
I'll send a chopper to pick you up.

465
00:21:30,411 --> 00:21:31,711
The closest helipad

466
00:21:31,779 --> 00:21:34,179
to you is... the 12th precinct.

467
00:21:34,247 --> 00:21:35,547
That's five blocks away.

468
00:21:35,614 --> 00:21:36,681
Can you t him there,

469
00:21:36,749 --> 00:21:38,415
Mr. Bauer?

470
00:21:40,152 --> 00:21:42,455
Yeah.

471
00:21:42,522 --> 00:21:44,257
I'll have a team there in 20 minutes.

472
00:21:44,325 --> 00:21:46,093
Make sure you don't use official channels.

473
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,795
We believe the assassin is
monitoring emergency bandwidth.

474
00:21:47,863 --> 00:21:49,298
Got it.

475
00:21:49,365 --> 00:21:54,403
Gather comm and tactical,
tell them we've got a situation.

476
00:21:54,471 --> 00:21:56,472
JACK: Let's go.

477
00:22:05,446 --> 00:22:06,746
There you are.

478
00:22:08,783 --> 00:22:10,717
Now that doesn't suck.

479
00:22:10,785 --> 00:22:11,718
Arlo.

480
00:22:11,786 --> 00:22:12,719
Yeah.

481
00:22:12,787 --> 00:22:14,487
Come on. Hastings called

482
00:22:14,555 --> 00:22:15,922
an emergency briefing.

483
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:17,156
And if he ever catches you

484
00:22:17,224 --> 00:22:18,791
doing that, you're gonna be out of a job.

485
00:22:18,859 --> 00:22:20,126
Be worth it.

486
00:22:20,193 --> 00:22:21,627
I think this mig be love.

487
00:22:21,694 --> 00:22:22,627
Now.

488
00:22:22,695 --> 00:22:24,395
This is CTU

489
00:22:24,463 --> 00:22:27,464
transferring control of drones A31 and 32

490
00:22:27,531 --> 00:22:29,298
to HS aerial command.

491
00:22:29,366 --> 00:22:30,299
Yeah, roger that.

492
00:22:30,367 --> 00:22:31,833
Offload confirmed.

493
00:22:31,901 --> 00:22:33,535
l right, we've got a situation.

494
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:36,070
Cole, I need you to scramble
a chopper for a pickup.

495
00:22:36,137 --> 00:22:37,104
Yeah. I haven't finished distributing

496
00:22:37,172 --> 00:22:38,105
the new patrol parameters.

497
00:22:38,173 --> 00:22:39,406
This is a priority.

498
00:22:39,473 --> 00:22:40,607
Who am I picking up?

499
00:22:40,674 --> 00:22:41,808
Someone who claims to have intel

500
00:22:41,875 --> 00:22:42,842
about a threat to President Hassan.

501
00:22:42,909 --> 00:22:45,243
How good is the intel?

502
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:46,510
Well, according to Jack Bauer, very.

503
00:22:46,578 --> 00:22:47,845
Jack Bauer?

504
00:22:47,913 --> 00:22:49,279
He's delivering the informant.

505
00:22:49,347 --> 00:22:51,047
Who is Jack Bauer?

506
00:22:54,384 --> 00:22:55,985
Location downtown; Chloe's
sending you the coordinates.

507
00:22:56,052 --> 00:22:57,486
Take a small team with you.

508
00:22:57,554 --> 00:22:58,954
Torres' people are free.

509
00:22:59,022 --> 00:23:01,156
Yes, sir. And I'll need a second
team to secure the landing.

510
00:23:01,224 --> 00:23:03,092
One team will be enough. We'll use a drone

511
00:23:03,159 --> 00:23:04,594
to protect the ground operation.

512
00:23:04,661 --> 00:23:06,930
Arlo, scramble a drone
alongside the chopper.

513
00:23:06,998 --> 00:23:08,598
Full spectrum coverage of the landing zone

514
00:23:08,666 --> 00:23:11,002
as well as the air corridor.

515
00:23:11,069 --> 00:23:12,871
Done.

516
00:23:21,252 --> 00:23:23,553
(sirens wailing, horn blaring)

517
00:23:23,621 --> 00:23:24,721
(siren blips)

518
00:23:39,365 --> 00:23:40,565
We're clear.

519
00:23:46,637 --> 00:23:49,806
Dispatch, this is Unit 2354.

520
00:23:49,873 --> 00:23:52,041
DISPATCH: Go ahead, 2354.

521
00:23:52,109 --> 00:23:54,176
Got a plate match on a stolen vehicle.

522
00:23:54,243 --> 00:23:57,479
(various overlapping radio communications)

523
00:23:57,546 --> 00:23:58,946
(tuning in):...03 Pontiac.

524
00:23:59,014 --> 00:24:05,416
Plate: Sierra, November, Echo,
one, five, Charlie, five.

525
00:24:05,484 --> 00:24:07,117
Got bullet holes in the windshield and body.

526
00:24:07,185 --> 00:24:08,152
That's him.

527
00:24:08,219 --> 00:24:09,252
DISPATCH: Roger that.

528
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,654
What's yr location?

529
00:24:10,721 --> 00:24:13,690
Vee's parked o18th,
just west of Ninth Avenue.

530
00:24:13,757 --> 00:24:15,591
We'll take care of it.

531
00:24:15,659 --> 00:24:16,692
Will you?

532
00:24:18,761 --> 00:24:20,628
Or am I going to have to step in?

533
00:24:22,297 --> 00:24:23,865
Now would be the time to tell me.

534
00:24:23,932 --> 00:24:25,699
Aruz is a dead man, sir.

535
00:24:25,767 --> 00:24:27,167
You have my word.

536
00:24:27,235 --> 00:24:29,403
Good.

537
00:24:54,231 --> 00:24:55,932
Thank you.

538
00:24:55,999 --> 00:24:56,998
Excuse me, Madam President.

539
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:02,834
President Hassan accepted our
counterproposals on inspections.

540
00:25:02,902 --> 00:25:05,267
That is great news.

541
00:25:05,335 --> 00:25:07,068
By the end of this next session,

542
00:25:07,135 --> 00:25:08,836
we may have a signed agreement.

543
00:25:08,904 --> 00:25:13,006
It's an extraordinary
accomplishment, Allison.

544
00:25:13,074 --> 00:25:16,943
(sighing)

545
00:25:18,011 --> 00:25:20,379
Is something wrong?

546
00:25:20,447 --> 00:25:23,949
I was thinking about Henry.

547
00:25:24,017 --> 00:25:27,352
Achieving a comprehensive peace agreement

548
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:29,654
with the Islamic Republic
was was something that

549
00:25:29,722 --> 00:25:31,623
he and I talked about years ago.

550
00:25:31,691 --> 00:25:36,762
I wish that he were here
to share the moment.

551
00:25:39,533 --> 00:25:41,634
You surprised?

552
00:25:41,702 --> 00:25:44,237
Considering his behavior during the divorce,

553
00:25:44,805 --> 00:25:46,972
yes, I am surprised.

554
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:48,573
He went out of his way to hurt you,

555
00:25:48,641 --> 00:25:49,607
especially in the press.

556
00:25:49,675 --> 00:25:51,175
He was angry, Ethan.

557
00:25:51,243 --> 00:25:52,943
I sent our daughter to prison.

558
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:54,944
You refused to cover up a murder.

559
00:25:55,012 --> 00:25:57,579
Olivia was responsible for what happened--

560
00:25:57,647 --> 00:25:58,881
no one else.

561
00:25:58,948 --> 00:26:01,416
Still, if the the situation
had been reversed,

562
00:26:01,484 --> 00:26:04,152
I might've felt the same way as Henry.

563
00:26:04,219 --> 00:26:05,953
Sorry if I'm interrupting, but I just talked

564
00:26:06,021 --> 00:26:07,087
to Brian Hastings at CTU.

565
00:26:07,155 --> 00:26:08,489
What's going on, Rob?

566
00:26:08,556 --> 00:26:10,524
They have someone who
claims he's got information

567
00:26:10,591 --> 00:26:12,292
about an assassination plot on Hassan.

568
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,460
How real is the threat?

569
00:26:13,528 --> 00:26:14,728
Real enough to loop you in.

570
00:26:14,796 --> 00:26:16,597
This informant came to
them through Jack Bauer.

571
00:26:16,665 --> 00:26:17,932
I thought that

572
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,135
Jack was out of all of this.
How did he get involved?

573
00:26:20,203 --> 00:26:22,170
As far as I can tell,
this informant came to him.

574
00:26:22,238 --> 00:26:24,139
We'll know more once the
informant signs an immunity deal,

575
00:26:24,207 --> 00:26:25,374
provided you authorize it.

576
00:26:25,442 --> 00:26:27,209
How secure is the venue
for the press conference?

577
00:26:27,277 --> 00:26:28,811
Very. And I just raised the alert level.

578
00:26:28,879 --> 00:26:31,614
But we need to set up a call to
inform Hassan about the threat,

579
00:26:31,681 --> 00:26:32,748
ideally before the conference gets started.

580
00:26:32,816 --> 00:26:33,915
We can't tell Hassan.

581
00:26:33,983 --> 00:26:36,250
<i>Certainly not before the press
conference.</i>

582
00:26:36,317 --> 00:26:37,517
Why not?

583
00:26:37,585 --> 00:26:40,186
Well, he might scuttle everything,
out of concern

584
00:26:40,254 --> 00:26:42,187
for his own safety. Hassan's a big boy.

585
00:26:42,255 --> 00:26:44,522
He's used to taking risks or he
wouldn't be here; you know that.

586
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:47,190
Plus, if Hassan finds out we knew
about this and didn't tell him,

587
00:26:47,258 --> 00:26:48,658
then all the trust we've built up

588
00:26:48,726 --> 00:26:50,359
over the last year goes out the window,

589
00:26:50,427 --> 00:26:52,027
and then he'll pull out of talks.

590
00:26:52,095 --> 00:26:53,728
And frankly, I wouldn't blame him.

591
00:26:59,568 --> 00:27:01,001
I'll think about it.

592
00:27:01,069 --> 00:27:03,070
Thank you both.

593
00:27:09,744 --> 00:27:10,845
Madam President, I'm telling you,

594
00:27:10,913 --> 00:27:12,113
holding this back from Hassan

595
00:27:12,181 --> 00:27:13,815
could be disastrous.

596
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:16,217
I said I'd think about it, Rob.

597
00:27:16,285 --> 00:27:17,318
Thank you.

598
00:27:30,766 --> 00:27:31,999
(sighs)

599
00:27:36,605 --> 00:27:38,539
Ethan...

600
00:27:38,607 --> 00:27:43,043
Listen-- sorry if I went after
you a little hard in there.

601
00:27:43,111 --> 00:27:44,978
Uh, I was just making my point.

602
00:27:45,046 --> 00:27:47,047
No need to apologize, Rob.

603
00:27:47,115 --> 00:27:48,615
I recommended you to the President

604
00:27:48,683 --> 00:27:51,351
<i>because you're not afraid
to speak up.</i>

605
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:53,587
She needs that.

606
00:27:53,655 --> 00:27:56,823
Yeah, well, still,
I know I can get carried away; I...

607
00:27:56,891 --> 00:28:01,194
Don't worry, kid... I ain't dead yet.

608
00:28:01,262 --> 00:28:03,430
I can handle mysf.

609
00:28:03,498 --> 00:28:06,099
Even up against you.

610
00:28:14,909 --> 00:28:16,577
Hey, sweetheart, it's me.

611
00:28:16,645 --> 00:28:19,513
Hey, we're almost finished packing.
Are you on your way?

612
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:23,548
Something came up.
I'm gonna be a little late.

613
00:28:23,615 --> 00:28:24,682
How late?

614
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:26,984
I think I should meet you at the airpo.

615
00:28:27,052 --> 00:28:27,985
Is everything okay?

616
00:28:28,053 --> 00:28:29,386
Yeah.

617
00:28:29,453 --> 00:28:30,720
Are you sure?

618
00:28:30,788 --> 00:28:32,688
Kim, I promise everything's fine.

619
00:28:32,756 --> 00:28:35,790
Well, Teri is so excited that
you're coming back with us.

620
00:28:35,858 --> 00:28:38,025
Just, uh, let me know
when you're on your way.

621
00:28:38,093 --> 00:28:40,160
Okay, thanks, sweetheart.

622
00:28:41,196 --> 00:28:42,563
Keep your eyes open.

623
00:28:42,631 --> 00:28:44,698
The precinct's two blocks away.

624
00:28:44,766 --> 00:28:46,432
Let's cut through here. Come on.

625
00:28:47,801 --> 00:28:49,801
The FAA's cleared a route and informed

626
00:28:49,869 --> 00:28:52,936
all relevant agencies that
we will be in the air.

627
00:28:54,138 --> 00:28:55,638
Good luck.

628
00:28:55,706 --> 00:28:58,209
Aruz's file-- it was in
a proprietary database.

629
00:28:58,277 --> 00:28:59,845
That's why it took so long.

630
00:28:59,912 --> 00:29:02,115
Still, that shouldn't have thrown you-
you've been here a month.

631
00:29:02,183 --> 00:29:04,653
Almost a month, and I've had
to relearn the interface

632
00:29:04,721 --> 00:29:06,488
on every major system here;
everything's changed.

633
00:29:06,556 --> 00:29:08,890
And you're having trouble adapting,
I understand.

634
00:29:08,957 --> 00:29:11,191
But I don't think it's a
question of your intelligence.

635
00:29:11,259 --> 00:29:12,626
Thanks.

636
00:29:12,694 --> 00:29:14,261
I think it's ambivalence.

637
00:29:14,328 --> 00:29:15,628
Ambivalence?!

638
00:29:15,696 --> 00:29:17,797
I know the only reason
you only took this job

639
00:29:17,865 --> 00:29:19,766
was because your husband was downsized.

640
00:29:19,833 --> 00:29:22,434
Am I wrong? No!

641
00:29:22,502 --> 00:29:23,669
I mean, yes.

642
00:29:23,737 --> 00:29:25,737
Please, just give me a little more time

643
00:29:25,805 --> 00:29:27,205
to get up to speed here.

644
00:29:28,607 --> 00:29:31,041
Mr. Hastings, I need this job.

645
00:29:32,076 --> 00:29:33,809
Fair enough.

646
00:29:33,877 --> 00:29:35,911
But I'm all about efficiency, so if your

647
00:29:35,978 --> 00:29:37,145
performance doesn't improve,

648
00:29:37,213 --> 00:29:38,679
you may want to rethink working here.

649
00:29:38,747 --> 00:29:42,450
Now, I trust this has been clarifying.

650
00:29:42,518 --> 00:29:44,619
Sure.

651
00:29:44,687 --> 00:29:46,254
If you really wanted to be more efficient,

652
00:29:46,322 --> 00:29:47,656
why don't you just say

653
00:29:47,724 --> 00:29:49,892
if I don't catch up soon,
I'm going to be fired?

654
00:29:57,102 --> 00:29:58,903
Your flight path is a straight shot

655
00:29:58,969 --> 00:30:00,535
southwest over the river,
and the 12th Precinct

656
00:30:00,603 --> 00:30:03,003
has confirmed that their helipad is clear

657
00:30:03,071 --> 00:30:04,738
and operational.
Comm net and satellite coverage

658
00:30:04,806 --> 00:30:05,872
of your flight, both legs,

659
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:07,307
and full-time aerial from the drone--

660
00:30:07,374 --> 00:30:09,041
Why are you looking at me like that?

661
00:30:09,109 --> 00:30:11,343
Like what?

662
00:30:12,846 --> 00:30:15,380
Look, I just want to make
sure nothing's wrong.

663
00:30:16,415 --> 00:30:17,548
Nothing's wrong,

664
00:30:17,615 --> 00:30:19,515
like I said.

665
00:30:19,583 --> 00:30:21,950
Just be careful, okay?

666
00:30:22,018 --> 00:30:23,351
I will be.

667
00:30:23,419 --> 00:30:24,485
You ready?

668
00:30:24,553 --> 00:30:26,220
Yeah.

669
00:30:29,456 --> 00:30:32,325
You know, maybe she
should finally set a date.

670
00:30:32,392 --> 00:30:33,726
She's getting cold feet.

671
00:30:33,794 --> 00:30:34,894
How about you shut up

672
00:30:34,962 --> 00:30:37,063
and just focus on your assignment?

673
00:30:58,151 --> 00:31:00,218
(labored breathing)

674
00:31:00,286 --> 00:31:01,453
Come on, Victor!

675
00:31:04,257 --> 00:31:05,824
Victor? Victor!

676
00:31:05,892 --> 00:31:07,159
Stay with me.

677
00:31:07,226 --> 00:31:08,693
Victor, stay with me!

678
00:31:08,761 --> 00:31:09,861
Stay with...

679
00:31:10,996 --> 00:31:13,164
Damn it.

680
00:31:13,231 --> 00:31:15,232
(grunts)

681
00:31:21,473 --> 00:31:23,473
(groaning)

682
00:31:42,961 --> 00:31:44,728
Stay with me!

683
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:48,730
We're going to need to recompress the wound.

684
00:32:08,924 --> 00:32:11,559
TV REPORTER: If successful,
the agreement could be the beginning

685
00:32:11,626 --> 00:32:13,761
of a real lasting peace in a lon
g-troubled region.

686
00:32:13,828 --> 00:32:16,396
Presidents Taylor and Hassan

687
00:32:16,464 --> 00:32:18,198
are scheduled to give their first joint

688
00:32:18,265 --> 00:32:21,134
press conference in just
a few minutes, and we'll

689
00:32:21,201 --> 00:32:22,268
carry that live.

690
00:32:22,336 --> 00:32:24,203
In a moment, Christiane Doumany will have

691
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:26,871
a report on the history of
the many failed attempts

692
00:32:26,939 --> 00:32:28,339
at a Mideast peace,

693
00:32:28,407 --> 00:32:30,308
and why this accord may be different.

694
00:32:30,376 --> 00:32:31,709
(turns off TV)

695
00:32:33,611 --> 00:32:35,578
It's time to go.

696
00:32:35,646 --> 00:32:37,781
Tell your father I'll be right there.

697
00:32:37,849 --> 00:32:40,386
I'll wait until you're done.

698
00:32:42,422 --> 00:32:44,690
He doesn't trust me to be on time.

699
00:32:44,758 --> 00:32:46,958
Of course he trusts you.

700
00:32:53,999 --> 00:32:57,401
When did you become such a good liar?

701
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:01,638
You don't have to defend your father, Dalia.

702
00:33:05,476 --> 00:33:07,477
He can take care of himself.

703
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:22,860
You look beautiful, Dalia.

704
00:33:22,927 --> 00:33:24,528
And you look handsome.

705
00:33:28,734 --> 00:33:30,835
Let's not pretend any more than we have to.

706
00:33:39,713 --> 00:33:42,081
I'm sorry you had to see that.

707
00:33:42,148 --> 00:33:44,016
It's not your fault.

708
00:33:48,356 --> 00:33:50,558
My dear Kayla.

709
00:33:52,728 --> 00:33:54,195
We should go.

710
00:33:55,231 --> 00:33:56,231
Yes.

711
00:34:14,939 --> 00:34:16,939
(indistinct background conversation)

712
00:34:25,213 --> 00:34:26,580
Let her through.

713
00:34:28,716 --> 00:34:30,282
(beep)

714
00:34:41,025 --> 00:34:42,125
Thank you.

715
00:34:42,193 --> 00:34:45,228
I will tell you the same
thing that I told him.

716
00:34:45,296 --> 00:34:47,228
Unless you want to destroy

717
00:34:47,296 --> 00:34:51,029
everything that he's worked for,
stay away from him.

718
00:35:02,869 --> 00:35:04,369
Excuse me, ma'am.

719
00:35:05,503 --> 00:35:07,003
President Hassan is on his way.

720
00:35:11,206 --> 00:35:13,206
You're not going to tell
him he's being targeted.

721
00:35:13,274 --> 00:35:15,508
Madam President, I'm sorry.

722
00:35:15,576 --> 00:35:17,676
You risk destroying in a
single day all the-- Rob,

723
00:35:17,744 --> 00:35:19,110
you've made your point.

724
00:35:19,178 --> 00:35:20,344
More than once.

725
00:35:20,412 --> 00:35:22,214
And believe me, I don't like keeping this

726
00:35:22,281 --> 00:35:24,050
from President Hassan any more than you do.

727
00:35:24,118 --> 00:35:25,251
Then tell him.

728
00:35:31,423 --> 00:35:32,422
Mr. President.

729
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:34,024
Ladies.

730
00:35:35,593 --> 00:35:37,394
You've met my chief of staff?

731
00:35:37,461 --> 00:35:38,394
Of course.

732
00:35:38,462 --> 00:35:39,762
Hello, Mr. President.

733
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:42,865
I haven't had the chance to
thank you for compromising

734
00:35:42,933 --> 00:35:44,299
on the verification issue.

735
00:35:45,635 --> 00:35:47,869
It was the right thing to do.

736
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:49,538
If you don't mind,

737
00:35:49,605 --> 00:35:50,939
I'd like to brief you both

738
00:35:51,006 --> 00:35:52,774
on the format of the press conference.

739
00:35:52,842 --> 00:35:54,609
The Secretary-General will be introducing

740
00:35:54,677 --> 00:35:56,545
you both after some brief remarks.

741
00:35:56,613 --> 00:35:58,513
The conference itself
shouldn't take any longer

742
00:35:58,581 --> 00:36:00,382
than 25 minutes or so.

743
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:03,252
(yelling)

744
00:36:03,319 --> 00:36:05,153
Put your hand on it.

745
00:36:06,038 --> 00:36:07,539
Let's go.

746
00:36:07,606 --> 00:36:09,073
We're almost there.

747
00:36:09,141 --> 00:36:10,475
MAN: Don't move!

748
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:12,310
Got a call that you two are having

749
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:13,745
a problem down here. What's up?

750
00:36:13,813 --> 00:36:15,180
Officer, my name is Jack Bauer.

751
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:17,315
I'm transporting this man on behalf of CTU.

752
00:36:17,382 --> 00:36:18,616
He's an informant vital

753
00:36:18,683 --> 00:36:19,816
to national security.

754
00:36:19,884 --> 00:36:21,751
Call it in. Listen to me.

755
00:36:21,819 --> 00:36:23,386
The men that are trying to kill him

756
00:36:23,454 --> 00:36:24,854
are monitoring all emergency channels.

757
00:36:24,921 --> 00:36:26,422
Do not let him make that call.

758
00:36:26,490 --> 00:36:27,723
Shut up and get against the Dumpster.

759
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:28,990
Now!

760
00:36:29,058 --> 00:36:30,425
At least take us into the precinct.

761
00:36:30,493 --> 00:36:32,660
We can verify everything there.

762
00:36:32,728 --> 00:36:35,496
Get down, now!

763
00:36:35,563 --> 00:36:37,831
(heavy gunfire)

764
00:36:49,308 --> 00:36:50,809
Damn it!

765
00:36:56,315 --> 00:36:57,015
I'm going to cover you.

766
00:36:57,083 --> 00:36:58,117
Make a run for the door.

767
00:36:58,184 --> 00:36:59,717
You ready? Go! Go!

768
00:37:05,055 --> 00:37:06,821
I'm out of bullets.

769
00:37:09,224 --> 00:37:11,357
Chloe, it's Jack.
How far out is the helicopter?

770
00:37:11,425 --> 00:37:12,658
Two minutes. Jack, what's wrong?

771
00:37:12,726 --> 00:37:13,859
We're under attack.

772
00:37:13,927 --> 00:37:15,193
I need you to put me in touch

773
00:37:15,261 --> 00:37:16,394
with whoever's in command of that unit.

774
00:37:16,462 --> 00:37:17,495
Okay. It's Agent Ortiz.

775
00:37:17,563 --> 00:37:18,796
He's the head of field ops.

776
00:37:18,864 --> 00:37:20,564
Is there a problem? Yes.

777
00:37:20,632 --> 00:37:23,633
Mr. Hastings, we have a
situation with the pickup.

778
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,201
Keep going to the roof. Now.

779
00:37:25,268 --> 00:37:26,201
Don't stop for anything.

780
00:37:26,269 --> 00:37:27,569
Keep going.

781
00:37:29,305 --> 00:37:31,538
Agent Ortiz, you're on with
Jack Bauer. ORTIZ: Roger.

782
00:37:31,606 --> 00:37:32,973
What's going on, Mr. Bauer?

783
00:37:33,041 --> 00:37:34,374
We're being pursued by two shooters.

784
00:37:34,441 --> 00:37:36,242
There's no way we're going
to make the precinct.

785
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:37,876
We're in a building on West 21st,

786
00:37:37,944 --> 00:37:39,344
three doors in from Ninth Avenue.

787
00:37:41,379 --> 00:37:43,346
We're heaWe're lookingposition
for an alternate pickup.ne.

788
00:37:43,414 --> 00:37:45,514
Copy that.

789
00:37:53,453 --> 00:37:56,521
Right there-- the roof of that
parking structure might work.

790
00:37:56,589 --> 00:37:57,522
Can you zoom in closer?

791
00:37:57,589 --> 00:37:58,523
The satellite's refreshing.

792
00:37:58,590 --> 00:37:59,524
It'll take a minute.

793
00:37:59,592 --> 00:38:01,493
I'm moving the drone there now.

794
00:38:01,561 --> 00:38:02,562
There's a parking structure next

795
00:38:02,629 --> 00:38:03,596
to the building you're in.

796
00:38:03,664 --> 00:38:04,664
Roof looks clear to land.

797
00:38:04,732 --> 00:38:05,865
DANA: Did you get that, Cole?

798
00:38:05,933 --> 00:38:07,834
Yeah, I see it. Mr. Bauer,

799
00:38:07,902 --> 00:38:09,671
looks like you can access that roof

800
00:38:09,739 --> 00:38:11,342
from the eighth floor of
the building you're in.

801
00:38:11,409 --> 00:38:13,077
How far out are you? 90 seconds.

802
00:38:13,145 --> 00:38:14,446
Copy that.

803
00:38:14,513 --> 00:38:15,980
Don't be late.

804
00:38:20,019 --> 00:38:22,053
Victor... Victor, listen to me.

805
00:38:22,121 --> 00:38:23,921
You got to tell me everything
you know about the hitter,

806
00:38:23,989 --> 00:38:24,956
so I can call it in

807
00:38:25,023 --> 00:38:26,324
in case we don't make it.

808
00:38:26,391 --> 00:38:28,359
If I don't make it,
I don't care what happens.

809
00:38:28,427 --> 00:38:30,895
Get me to CTU.

810
00:38:33,665 --> 00:38:35,065
You always were a son of a bitch.

811
00:38:35,133 --> 00:38:37,567
Come on.

812
00:38:51,184 --> 00:38:52,652
(groans)

813
00:39:05,266 --> 00:39:06,266
Come on.

814
00:39:06,334 --> 00:39:07,801
Let's go.

815
00:39:10,205 --> 00:39:11,338
Stay there.

816
00:39:31,525 --> 00:39:34,160
Lock down access points to the roof!

817
00:39:36,396 --> 00:39:38,431
Where are the hostiles? They're dead.

818
00:39:38,498 --> 00:39:41,333
You need to get him out of here.
He's losing a lot of blood.

819
00:39:41,401 --> 00:39:43,001
Cole Ortiz. It's an honor to meet you.

820
00:39:43,069 --> 00:39:44,269
Thanks for doing this.

821
00:39:44,337 --> 00:39:46,171
Look, Hastings wants to
debrief you back at CTU.

822
00:39:46,239 --> 00:39:48,006
I'm not going back to CTU.
I delivered him, I'm done.

823
00:39:48,074 --> 00:39:50,843
No, Mr. Bauer... I got a flight to catch.

824
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:52,511
That's it?

825
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:55,747
Get down!

826
00:40:09,527 --> 00:40:11,794
Ortiz, report in.

827
00:40:11,862 --> 00:40:13,395
CHLOE: Agent Ortiz?

828
00:40:17,199 --> 00:40:18,499
Agent Ortiz, what's your status?

829
00:40:20,602 --> 00:40:22,903
Agent Ortiz?

830
00:40:22,971 --> 00:40:25,705
Jack, come in.

831
00:40:25,773 --> 00:40:27,374
Jack, can you hear me?

832
00:40:27,441 --> 00:40:30,009
Anyone, come in.

833
00:40:32,746 --> 00:40:34,380
(panting)

834
00:40:37,884 --> 00:40:39,051
Victor.

835
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:41,686
Victor, Victor, come on.

836
00:40:41,754 --> 00:40:43,387
Stay with me, stay with me.

837
00:40:43,455 --> 00:40:44,455
Listen to me.

838
00:40:44,522 --> 00:40:45,823
You don't want to die like this.

839
00:40:45,890 --> 00:40:48,158
Do the right thing.

840
00:40:48,259 --> 00:40:49,392
Tell me what you know.

841
00:40:51,427 --> 00:40:53,794
The hitter has someone on the inside.

842
00:40:55,597 --> 00:40:58,164
Close to Hassan.

843
00:40:58,232 --> 00:41:00,233
Give me a name

844
00:41:00,301 --> 00:41:02,435
Give me a name. Give me a name!

845
00:41:02,503 --> 00:41:03,503
(coughs)

846
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:04,770
Victor...

847
00:41:04,838 --> 00:41:05,905
Victor, who's on the inside?

848
00:41:05,973 --> 00:41:08,174
Victor!

849
00:41:08,242 --> 00:41:09,275
Come on.

850
00:41:09,343 --> 00:41:10,978
Come on, come on.

851
00:41:12,814 --> 00:41:15,615
No.

852
00:41:18,786 --> 00:41:20,754
He's dead.

853
00:41:22,523 --> 00:41:24,858
(grunts)

854
00:41:28,796 --> 00:41:30,530
No.

855
00:41:30,597 --> 00:41:32,098
The brother revoked my clearance,

856
00:41:32,166 --> 00:41:34,233
but I had Hassan reinstate it.

857
00:41:34,268 --> 00:41:36,669
No, I know.

858
00:41:36,737 --> 00:41:38,805
I know I'm behind schedule.

859
00:41:38,873 --> 00:41:41,108
But it'll get done.

860
00:41:41,175 --> 00:41:44,517
