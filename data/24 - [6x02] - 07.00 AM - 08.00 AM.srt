00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:20,912
Mr President, my analysts believe Assad's
organisation cannot survive without him,

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,878
and once he's dead, the attacks will stop.

3
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:27,748
CTU needs to eliminate Assad.
That's all there is to it.

4
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,229
God knows we're paying
a steep enough price to get him.

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,518
We were contacted four days ago
by a man named Fayed.

6
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,673
He offered to give us Assad's location for a
list of demands. One of them was Jack Bauer.

7
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,799
We're asking you to sacrifice yourself
so we can eliminate Assad.

8
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:46,749
The reason why I fought to stay alive in China
was because I didn't want to die for nothing.

9
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:50,037
Today... I can die for something.

10
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:53,113
You kept your end of the deal, I'll keep mine.

11
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,509
I have a transponder at Assad's location.

12
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,956
33-58-11 north latitude.

13
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:02,589
118-21-40 west longitude.

14
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,797
Have Bowen mobilise the helicopters.
I'll tell the president we're a go.

15
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,749
CTU is about to kill the wrong man.

16
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,355
Assad isn't behind these attacks.

17
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,238
He's come here to stop them.

18
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,199
He's come here... to stop... me.

19
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,590
Get out of my house.

20
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,593
- This kid's father's a terrorist.
- He's no more of a terrorist than you or me.

21
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,434
- Tell me what happened.
- The FBI. They took my father.

22
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,308
<i>- Are you sure the FBI didn't find the package?
- Yes. It's well hidden.</i>

23
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,197
You need to deliver it soon.

24
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,589
<i>(flatline)</i>

25
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,795
<i>(speaks Arabic language)</i>

26
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:55,077
Get in there! Find him!

27
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,957
Wait.

28
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:12,476
- We have to go.
- Not until we find Bauer.

29
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,711
We're not here to kill one American,
we're here to kill thousands.

30
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,268
But he knows the truth.

31
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,316
It doesn't matter.

32
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,278
By the time Bauer tells anyone,
it will be too late.

33
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,036
Assad will be dead and we'll
be free to finish what we started.

34
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,989
Fayed, listen to me. If we don't leave now,
we'll jeopardise the mission.

35
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,919
All right.

36
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,828
<i>(man shouts in Arabic language)</i>

37
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,834
- This our target?
- This is where Fayed says Assad is now.

38
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,797
- Heat signature?
- They're shielded.

39
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,110
We can't tell how many are in there.

40
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,794
If there's anyone in there at all.

41
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:29,509
Fayed lied to us.
And Jack bought the farm for nothing.

42
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,353
Shut up, Milo.

43
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,191
What's her problem?

44
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,078
Jack's a friend of hers.
It hurt her that he died that way.

45
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:44,518
You might want to attenuate your
thoughtless remarks once in a while.

46
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,559
Two Cobra attack helicopters
are being launched.

47
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,835
They'll hit Assad's location in 15 minutes.

48
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,433
- Excuse me, sir.
- What is it?

49
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,432
Jack Bauer's calling in. Line two.

50
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,593
Jack, it's Bill. Thank God you're alive.
What happened?

51
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,671
Listen. We do not have a lot of time.

52
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,638
- I need you to call off the air strike.
- Why?

53
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:23,872
You're going after the wrong man.
Assad is not responsible for the bombings.

54
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,989
- Where did you get this information?
- I'll explain when you call it off.

55
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:32,516
I don't have the power
to rescind a presidential order, Jack.

56
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,398
- Put me through to the president. I'll tell him.
- Jack...

57
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:38,552
Bill, trust me. Just put me through
to the White House.

58
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,915
All right. Stay on the line.

59
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,478
<i>(woman) Bill Buchanan
for the president. Priority three.</i>

60
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,152
<i>- Put him through.
- Yes, sir.</i>

61
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,549
<i>- Bill?
- (Bill) There's new information</i>

62
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,551
<i>regarding the air strike on Assad.</i>

63
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,950
I'm on the line with Jack Bauer.
He escaped from Fayed.

64
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,918
What? How?

65
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,232
<i>I'm not sure, but he's requesting
that we abort the air strike against Assad.</i>

66
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,154
- For what possible reason, Bill?
- He says Assad is not behind the attacks.

67
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,232
Bill, that's insane.
What is Jack basing this on?

68
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,914
He wants to talk directly to the president.

69
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,230
<i>- Put him on.
- (Bill) You're on the line, Jack.</i>

70
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,038
- Mr President.
- Jack...

71
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,192
We don't have a lot of time.
Did Bill explain about Assad?

72
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,999
Yes, he has,
but we're all sceptical here.

73
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,437
- What's Assad doing in this country?
- Trying to stop them, trying to stop Fayed.

74
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,637
So you're saying that Fayed
is carrying out these bombings?

75
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:39,679
Yes, sir. Fayed admitted to me
that Assad is planning to renounce terrorism.

76
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:43,514
He's trying to mainstream his organisation,
bring them into politics.

77
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,717
Fayed wants to stop that.
Fayed is behind these attacks.

78
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,952
Jack, this is inconsistent with
20 years of terrorism on Assad's part.

79
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,749
His organisation has waged
nonstop war against the West.

80
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,115
He's responsible for hundreds of deaths.

81
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,112
I am aware of Assad's history,
and I am still telling you

82
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:04,079
that there is sufficient cause
to call off this strike.

83
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,949
What if we change to a ground assault?

84
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,873
Sir, we cannot afford a ground assault.

85
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,428
We have to take him out
while we've got the chance.

86
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,069
Mr President, if Jack is right,
it's a risk we have to take.

87
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,072
Jack has been in
a Chinese prison for 20 months.

88
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,709
His ability to assess this situation
is highly questionable.

89
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,395
- I believe he's being played.
- I know what I heard. I am not being played.

90
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:30,438
With all deference to Mr Bauer,
I think Karen is right.

91
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,990
Mr President, if you wanna stop
these attacks, you need to stop Fayed.

92
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,517
To do that, you need to capture Assad
and find out what he knows.

93
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,831
Sir, he might be the only hope you have.

94
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:47,953
Mr President, I know your history
with Mr Bauer runs deep,

95
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:51,350
but don't let that impact yourjudgment here.

96
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,276
We have the opportunity
to eliminate Assad. We have to take it.

97
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,669
I want real-time progress
on that air strike.

98
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,718
- I'm sending a video uplink.
- Mr President, don't do this.

99
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,633
Jack, I am sorry.

100
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,711
I am.

101
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,636
Give me your location.
I'll send a unit.

102
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,759
Killing Assad is a mistake. Right now,
he's your only chance of finding Fayed.

103
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,150
It's the president's call.
We'll do all we can when you get back.

104
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:29,233
<i>- That'll be too late.
- Jack, tell me where you are.</i>

105
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,829
Don't put me on hold again.
Just give me the agent in charge.

106
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,229
I will wait on the line.

107
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:05,757
Dammit. She says they'll
call me back on this number.

108
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,833
- Where are they holding my father?
- They cannot release that information.

109
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,558
<i>(phone rings)</i>

110
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,596
<i>- Hello.
- (Fayed) You have the package?</i>

111
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,593
I'm at my friend's. They're helping me
find out where the FBI took my father.

112
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,148
- You're not free to talk?
- No.

113
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,232
Just tell me if you have the package.

114
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,591
Not yet, but I'll have it soon.

115
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:30,229
There are other people
I could have chosen for this task,

116
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,515
but I chose you.

117
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,797
Now get out of there. Retrieve the package.

118
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,030
Call me when you have it.

119
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,236
Yes. I will.

120
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,953
I have to go back to my house.
I'm meeting my uncle.

121
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,156
- Do you think that's wise?
- Are you sure?

122
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,277
<i>- (Scott) Ahmed, stay here.
- I'll be fine. Don't worry.</i>

123
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,796
- Thank you for everything. Thank you.
- OK. Take care.

124
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,519
Don't worry. His family's
taking care of him now.

125
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,114
Ahmed. Hold on.

126
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,555
Listen, I'm sorry. I...

127
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,997
I can't believe this is happening.
It's like the whole world has gone crazy.

128
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:10,709
It's been crazy for a long time.
We just haven't been paying attention.

129
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,791
Yeah, well, we are now.

130
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,873
You know what, you should take this.

131
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:22,272
I got this at a fair in Oregon.
It's supposed to mean good luck.

132
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,194
Thanks, but I... can't take it.

133
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,236
Why?

134
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:36,077
You might need it yourself someday.

You're also online with the president.
We're monitoring the Cobras.

confirmation that Assad is dead?

142
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:12,473
Curtis will lead a team into the target zone.
He'll do a point-by-point grid search.

<i>(man) Changing course to one-eight-three
for southerly approach to target.</i>

150

<i>(man #2) Roger, Zebra One.
One-eight-three.</i>

<i>(man) Lock in 2 minutes and 30 seconds.</i>

152
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,235
Drop the coffee.

153
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,190
Don't move. Don't even think about it.

154
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,271
Where is Assad?

155
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:13,591
- Where is Assad?!
- Put down your weapon.

156
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,591
- My name is Jack Bauer.
- I know.

157
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,593
This house has been targeted for a strike.
I need to get you and your men out.

158
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,477
Check the street.

159
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,630
I came here alone.
I know about Fayed.

160
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,474
- I know you're here to stop him.
- There's no one outside.

161
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,473
Fayed has set you up. He provided CTU
with the coordinates to this house.

162
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,518
- Kill him, Assad.
- In a few minutes, we'll all be dead.

163
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,310
- Don't listen to him. It's a trap.
- There's a transponder in this house.

164
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:44,632
- US military is using it to pinpoint the strike.
- There is no transponder here.

165
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,678
We've searched the entire house.

166
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:58,879
One of your men must have it on them.
That's the only possible explanation.

167
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:02,430
One of your men is working for Fayed.
Have them empty their pockets.

168
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:06,479
- Assad, don't listen to him. He's lying.
- Dammit, I am telling you the truth.

169
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,075
Why else would I be here? If I wanted
to kill you, I'd have come in shooting.

170
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,118
Have your men empty their pockets!

171
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,113
I'm trying to save your life.

172
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,317
Wait.

173
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,193
- Empty your pockets.
- But...

174
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,669
I said empty your pockets.

175
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,910
Behind you!

176
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,877
Search him.

177
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,872
- You betrayed us.
- No.

178
00:13:55,960 --> 00:14:00,238
- You're the one who betrayed his people.
- Assad, we need to leave now.

179
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,871
If you are telling the truth,
you will not need that gun.

180
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:11,474
<i>(man) Go, Assad. You need to leave.
We'll secure the files.</i>

181
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,630
<i>(Assad) Hurry up.</i>

182
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,919
Move! Move!

183
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:36,313
Are you all right? Get him up.

184
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,799
Move.

185
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,348
Mr President, the target has been destroyed.

186
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:03,117
We are an advocacy group. These people
are all volunteers. They're very good people.

187
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:08,320
I'm sure. We're assembling a database of
names to crosscheck against our watch list.

188
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:12,234
<i>- (woman) Excuse me, Sandra. The FBI's here.
- FBI?</i>

189
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,199
They're asking for access
to our personnel records.

190
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:21,398
<i>(man) We take pride in being good citizens,
and will cooperate to stop the attacks.</i>

191
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:24,756
May I see your warrant, gentlemen?
I'm Mr Al-Rezani's attorney.

192
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:28,628
- I also represent this organisation.
- We know who you are, ma'am.

193
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,075
And I'm afraid we don't have a warrant.

194
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,993
I'm afraid we can't
turn over our personnel records.

195
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:37,390
That information is private,
and privacy is protected by law.

196
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,711
I understand, but in light
of what's happening in the country,

197
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,951
we don't think it's unreasonable
to ask for cooperation.

198
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:47,157
You're in the wrong place.
There are no terrorists here.

199
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:52,394
So unless you have a warrant,
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

200
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,190
Please don't make me ask twice.

201
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,795
All right, ma'am.

202
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:09,277
- This is getting out of hand.
- Maybe we should give them what they want.

203
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,510
- You're serious?
- We've nothing to hide.

204
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,670
No, but we have something to protect -

205
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,320
the privacy of everyone
who's ever worked here.

206
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,836
Maybe we have to sacrifice privacy.
The country's under attack.

207
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,956
We cannot pretend it isn't.

208
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:25,237
- Who are you calling?
- Yes, it's Sandra Palmer.

209
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:28,153
I'd like to speak with my brother.

210
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,958
We're sweeping the zone.
We've recovered four bodies.

211
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:37,077
<i>Forensics is running field ID.
They're sending data to CTU.</i>

212
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:40,072
<i>- Well, let's hope one of them is Assad.
- (phone beeps)</i>

213
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,720
<i>- Yes?
- (woman) The president's sister on the line.</i>

214
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,394
<i>- He'll wanna call her back.
- She says it's urgent.</i>

215
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,675
- I'll take it.
- Mr President, we're...

216
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:51,230
Tom, it's OK.
Let me have the room, please.

217
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,233
- What's going on, Sandra?
- I'm sorry, but I think you need to know.

218
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:15,111
The FBI was just here, and they
wanted access to the IAA's personnel records.

219
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,909
- Did they say why?
- Some excuse about expanding a database.

220
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,916
Listen, Sandra. I...

221
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,477
You know I have to do whatever I can
to stop these attacks, right?

222
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,390
Yes.

223
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:34,110
That includes giving law enforcement
the authority to follow up every single lead.

224
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,078
That's my point.
They weren't following any lead.

225
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:41,153
They were invading a group of people's
privacy based on their religion.

226
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:44,471
Look, Wayne, you know
I'm not some idealistic flag burner,

227
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:47,711
and I understand you're going through
a complicated situation,

228
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:52,430
but once you start ethnic profiling,
it's a slippery slope.

229
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,954
<i>- I'll look into it.
- Start with Tom Lennox.</i>

230
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:58,032
- This has his name written all over it.
- Don't start in on Tom.

231
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:01,396
He treats the Constitution
like a list of suggestions.

232
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:05,473
He's laying the framework for a crackdown,
and civil protections be damned.

233
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:08,233
Let's be honest,
you don't like Tom and you never have.

234
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,515
Neither did David.

235
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,516
<i>(phone beeps)</i>

236
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,717
<i>- Yes?
- (woman) Bill Buchanan's on the line.</i>

237
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,109
One moment. Sandra, I gotta go.

238
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,351
Wayne, look,
I'm sorry to put this on you, OK?

239
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:31,150
I... I just wouldn't have called
if I didn't think it was important.

240
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,708
I understand.

241
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:37,349
- You take care of yourself, OK?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. I love you too.

242
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:47,111
- I hope I got through to him.
- You made a good case. He'll listen.

243
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,151
Thanks.

244
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:58,232
- For what?
- For making that call.

245
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,949
And for not letting me
lose sight of what we're fighting for.

246
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,352
<i>- (Palmer) Go ahead.
- We completed our sweep of the zone.</i>

247
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:12,115
<i>- Four bodies. None of them is Assad.
- What?</i>

248
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:16,239
<i>- (Karen) Are you sure?
- We're checking, but I think Assad is alive.</i>

249
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,198
- How did we miss him?!
- Someone must have warned him.

250
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:23,034
Or the intel from Fayed was bad,
and Assad was never there to begin with.

251
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,839
Irrelevant. What matters
is that Assad is out there.

252
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:30,152
We're sealing a ten-block perimeter
around the area. Assad may be in the vicinity.

253
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,152
All right, Bill.

254
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,629
We put everything we had into that strike.

255
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:40,748
We thought if we could cut off the head
we could stop these attacks, and now...

256
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:46,115
Tom, what do you think
Assad's next move is gonna be?

257
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:50,637
Likely, there will be more attacks,
but respond he will, guaranteed.

258
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,953
<i>- (Fayed) Ahmed will have the package soon.
- Good.</i>

259
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,349
- Is he ready?
- Yes. He is waiting for you.

260
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,829
<i>(speaks Arabic language)</i>

261
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,229
That's not necessary.

262
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,788
I will not fail you.

263
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:02,470
I don't question your devotion, Nasir.

264
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:08,996
When the moment approaches,
even the most devout can experience fear.

265
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,750
Look at me.

266
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,839
By overcoming your fear,
you prove your worth.

267
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:26,349
I am proud to have
known you in this life, Nasir.

268
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:29,557
Your family will learn about your sacrifice.

269
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,795
<i>(man) All right. One more load.</i>

270
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,951
Let's go.

271
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,837
Put him here.

272
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,191
He's unconscious.

273
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:30,193
CTU's gonna realise you weren't killed.
They'll widen their search grid.

274
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:34,239
- We can't stay here much longer.
- He knows where Fayed is.

275
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,709
I only need a few minutes.

276
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:43,074
Fayed told me that you wanted to disarm. You
were gonna start negotiations. Is that true?

277
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:46,994
Most of my people and the governments
that support us agreed to a cease-fire.

278
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,196
- Fayed wants to sabotage it?
- Yes.

279
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,999
Once Fayed is eliminated,
everyone will fall into line

280
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,150
and I can go public with my proposal.

281
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,630
But finding Fayed
is the key to everything.

282
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,475
I'll be right back.

283
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,276
<i>Buchanan.</i>

284
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:28,638
I know why Assad wasn't in the building
when the missile hit. I need to show you.

285
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:43,277
This is an aerial frame enhancement of the
building seconds before it was destroyed.

286
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,715
Jack rescued Assad.

287
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,438
OK, OK.

288
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,431
This makes sense...

289
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:55,479
from Jack's perspective,
if Assad is trying to stop the bombing.

290
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:59,519
But President Palmer and your wife -
I mean, Karen Hayes - think he's wrong.

291
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,478
So what am I supposed to do with this?

292
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,630
- Who else has seen it?
- Nobody but me.

293
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,915
OK. Let's keep it that way for now.

294
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,958
Jack didn't save Assad
out of compassion.

295
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:13,669
- He's gonna use him to find Fayed.
- We should be looking for Fayed too.

296
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,796
Right.

297
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:19,111
Filter the chatter stream,
see if anything sources out on Fayed.

298
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,430
- OK.
- Good work.

299
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,277
We have a car.

300
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,712
If we're gonna find Fayed in time,
we have to involve CTU.

301
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:36,155
The people who tried to kill me
and killed my men?

302
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:41,553
- They have resources you don't.
- They will question me for days.

303
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,837
Fayed worked under me.
I know how he thinks, and I will find him,

304
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:48,117
but I will do it on my terms.

305
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,955
- Where is Fayed?
- I do not know.

306
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:57,350
- Where is he?!
- I was just ordered to plant the transponder.

307
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:08,036
- Where is Fayed?
- I do not know.

308
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,109
Please stop.

309
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:20,909
Please.

310
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,835
Why did you stop?

311
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:30,434
I can see it in his eyes.

312
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,954
He's not gonna tell us anything.

313
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,310
Where is Fayed?

314
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:01,190
I know where some of his men will be.
I heard Fayed giving instructions to go there.

315
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,635
Where?

316
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:06,996
- Figueroa and Sixth.
- When?

317
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,878
After you were killed.

318
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:15,593
- You've told me everything?
- Yes.

319
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:18,194
I swear it.

320
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,391
I swear it.

321
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,835

how you felt you were doing the right thing.

324
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:37,274
I admire your conviction,

325
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,668
but you have taken the wrong path.

326

I'm sorry.

327
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,351
Let's go.

328
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,957
My men are dead. I can find Fayed.

329
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,634
But I cannot stop him by myself.

330
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,834
I don't know how to do this any more.

331
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:14,074
You'll remember.

You'd better come out here.
The FBI is back. They have a warrant.

334

Who is the applicant for this?
I wanna see the affidavit.

335
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:50,478
The papers are on file with a district court.
We have a legally executed warrant.

336
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:54,314
Either you hand over the files,
or we take them. It's your choice.

337
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:58,279
This is an administrative warrant.
It's not valid in this situation.

338

That's your opinion.

I'll show you.

I need to use your computer.

342
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:26,950
Malek, I need copies
of all of our personnel files.

- Wait. He has nothing to do with this.

- But I'm telling you, he's not involved.

This is for everyone

How do you like it, huh?

362
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,434
Get up. Get up!

Over there.

380
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:35,995
Two men in suits, one carrying a briefcase.
These are Fayed's men.

381
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,958
The man in front
is wearing an explosive vest.

382

He's setting up another strike.

Go.

00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,869

<i>(Assad) The detonator is in his right hand.</i>

- Only the bomber is getting on.

387
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:47,591
The other man is the handler.
He'll see the bomber off, then he'll leave.

388
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,989
The handler will lead us to Fayed.

You follow the handler.

You have a terrorist on this train with a bomb.
I need you to walk away.

Once again, the streets
are flowing with blood.

415

Three simultaneous bombings.
One in a shopping mall, another in a hotel.

It was here. On the Metro Red Line.
It appears to be a suicide bomber.

419
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:13,916
May be some good news. Aside from
the bomber, no one else was killed.

420
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,471
- How the hell could that happen?
- A passenger ejected the bomber.

421
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,632
The passenger
identified himself as Jack Bauer.

422
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:28,916
If Jack was on that train, he'll have been
caught on camera. I want visual confirmation.

- Yes, sir.
- Sir, you need to hear this.

424
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:34,597
It's a cellphone call

Mr President, if it's any consolation,

these attacks were planned
in advance of the raid on Assad.

Tom, all that means is
there will be more attacks.
