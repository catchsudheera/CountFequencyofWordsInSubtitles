00:00:16,452 --> 00:00:18,520
Let's get the other
body and get cleaned up

3
00:00:18,588 --> 00:00:19,955
before we head back to CTU.

4
00:00:20,023 --> 00:00:22,591
I'm trying to locate an
individual by the name

5
00:00:22,659 --> 00:00:24,593
of Kevin Wade.

6
00:00:24,661 --> 00:00:27,296
Kevin's probation
officer just called me.

7
00:00:27,363 --> 00:00:28,964
He has records that
show him calling my cell

8
00:00:29,032 --> 00:00:30,766
several times.

9
00:00:30,834 --> 00:00:32,100
Look, you just have
to handle this, okay?

10
00:00:32,168 --> 00:00:33,869
I don't know if I can do this.

11
00:00:33,937 --> 00:00:35,938
Lie. Come on, we both
know you're good at it.

12
00:00:36,005 --> 00:00:38,607
Put your hands where
I can see them!

13
00:00:38,675 --> 00:00:40,609
Do not move!

14
00:00:40,677 --> 00:00:42,711
Samir, Marcos is
out of the chamber.

15
00:00:42,779 --> 00:00:44,713
Hang up right now and
transmit the fail safe!

16
00:00:46,316 --> 00:00:47,583
What's happening? What is that?
! Marcos, I don't know

17
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:49,518
if I'm gonna be able
to do this in time.

18
00:00:49,586 --> 00:00:51,620
How were they gonna smuggle
the fuel rods into the city

19
00:00:51,688 --> 00:00:53,121
past the radiological detectors?
I don't know!

20
00:00:53,189 --> 00:00:54,857
Damn it, Marcos, give me a name!

21
00:00:54,924 --> 00:00:58,093
President Hassan's head of security,
Tarin Faroush.

22
00:01:02,966 --> 00:01:05,467
Right now you need to call UN
Security and have them take

23
00:01:05,535 --> 00:01:07,336
Mr. Faroush into custody
until we get there.

24
00:01:07,403 --> 00:01:09,638
Tarin's not here. Where is he?

25
00:01:09,706 --> 00:01:11,106
I don't know.
Somewhere with my daughter.

26
00:01:11,174 --> 00:01:13,742
Tarin is working with
your father's enemies.

27
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:16,278
You must tell me where you are.

28
00:01:16,346 --> 00:01:19,514
The Teodore Hotel, Suite 514.

29
00:01:19,582 --> 00:01:20,582
Just stay where you are.

30
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:22,451
The police will be there shortly.

31
00:01:22,518 --> 00:01:24,620
I thought we agreed

32
00:01:24,687 --> 00:01:26,255
you weren't gonna take
your mother's call.

33
00:01:26,322 --> 00:01:28,657
I'm sorry, my love,
I just didn't want her to worry.

34
00:01:28,725 --> 00:01:30,259
Did you tell her where we are?

35
00:01:30,326 --> 00:01:31,760
Of course not.

36
00:01:34,197 --> 00:01:35,697
We're arriving at the landing now.

37
00:01:35,765 --> 00:01:39,268
Soon we'll be able to transport
the rods into Manhattan.

38
00:01:39,335 --> 00:01:42,004
Are CTU's radiation sensors down?

39
00:01:42,071 --> 00:01:43,405
Not yet, but we'll be ready.

40
00:01:56,953 --> 00:01:57,986
All right, listen up!

41
00:01:59,522 --> 00:02:02,257
This is what we know.

42
00:02:02,325 --> 00:02:05,727
IRK nationalists are targeting
New York with a dirty bomb.

43
00:02:05,795 --> 00:02:06,962
We have one lead:

44
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:09,765
Hassan's former head of security,
Tarin Faroush.

45
00:02:09,832 --> 00:02:12,734
We believe he wants to
disable our defenses

46
00:02:12,802 --> 00:02:14,136
so they can smuggle the
bomb into Manhattan.

47
00:02:14,203 --> 00:02:15,504
Chloe?

48
00:02:15,571 --> 00:02:17,339
Latest intel is that Tarin is
staying at the Teodore Hotel

49
00:02:17,407 --> 00:02:19,675
with President Hassan's
daughter, Kayla.

50
00:02:19,742 --> 00:02:21,543
Kayla has been warned by her mother

51
00:02:21,611 --> 00:02:22,978
that Tarin is working
with the terrorists.

52
00:02:23,046 --> 00:02:24,680
She'll be trying to
keep him at the hotel

53
00:02:24,747 --> 00:02:25,881
until our Tac teams arrive.

54
00:02:25,949 --> 00:02:27,115
What's our ETA othat?

55
00:02:27,183 --> 00:02:29,151
NYPD is approaching
the staging area,

56
00:02:29,218 --> 00:02:31,153
CTU still ten minutes out.

57
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:33,555
Chloe, you liaise with NYPD.

58
00:02:33,623 --> 00:02:35,057
Actually, Dana is better at the

59
00:02:35,124 --> 00:02:38,093
inter-agency protocols than I am.

60
00:02:38,161 --> 00:02:39,828
Fine.

61
00:02:39,896 --> 00:02:41,830
Jack Bauer's heading Field Ops,

62
00:02:41,898 --> 00:02:45,334
Dana's on point with NYPD,
Arlo will run aerial.

63
00:02:45,401 --> 00:02:46,902
Let's get to it.

64
00:02:52,275 --> 00:02:54,910
All the changes going
on around here,

65
00:02:54,978 --> 00:02:56,979
who do I report to exactly,
you or Dana?

66
00:02:57,046 --> 00:02:58,547
What does it matter?

67
00:02:58,614 --> 00:03:01,316
I just like to be clear.
The only thing you need to be

68
00:03:01,384 --> 00:03:03,986
clear about is that there's
a dirty bomb about to go off

69
00:03:04,053 --> 00:03:05,721
in Manhattan, so just do your job.

70
00:03:07,824 --> 00:03:10,492
Drone's in position
over the Teodore Hotel

71
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,362
awaiting your instructions.

72
00:03:35,551 --> 00:03:38,587
Kayla, we have to go.

73
00:03:38,654 --> 00:03:41,656
Nearly ready.

74
00:03:47,463 --> 00:03:48,797
What was that? Are you all right?

75
00:03:48,865 --> 00:03:52,067
It was nothing, I'm fine.

76
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,787
Hello?

77
00:04:11,854 --> 00:04:13,422
The Americans got Marcos to talk.

78
00:04:13,489 --> 00:04:15,757
He may have compromised you.

79
00:04:15,825 --> 00:04:18,193
Did the girl receive
any phone calls?

80
00:04:18,261 --> 00:04:19,861
Yes, one- her mother. Get out now.

81
00:04:19,929 --> 00:04:21,029
And bring her with you.

82
00:04:21,097 --> 00:04:22,197
We're moving to the next phase.

83
00:04:22,265 --> 00:04:23,498
I'll need a vehicle.

84
00:04:23,566 --> 00:04:25,133
Hamid is on his way.

85
00:04:29,305 --> 00:04:30,806
Kayla,

86
00:04:30,873 --> 00:04:34,409
we must go now.

87
00:04:34,477 --> 00:04:38,046
Just one more minute.

88
00:04:38,114 --> 00:04:39,815
Hurry up, please.

89
00:04:49,058 --> 00:04:51,359
Jack, I'm uploading Tarin
Faroush's file to you now.

90
00:04:51,427 --> 00:04:52,561
Copy that.

91
00:04:52,628 --> 00:04:54,863
Okay, I've got it.
We're also gonna need

92
00:04:54,931 --> 00:04:57,499
hotel schematics and access
to their security systems.

93
00:04:57,567 --> 00:04:58,733
Coming to you now.

94
00:04:58,801 --> 00:05:00,902
Target is in room 514.

95
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:03,238
Hotel security is standing
by to give NYPD access.

96
00:05:03,306 --> 00:05:05,907
Jack, Brian Hastings.
What's your ETA?

97
00:05:05,975 --> 00:05:07,075
About eight minutes.
Can you patch me through

98
00:05:07,143 --> 00:05:08,310
to our point man at NYPD?

99
00:05:08,377 --> 00:05:09,544
We're doing that now.

100
00:05:09,612 --> 00:05:12,214
Name's, uh, Sergeant Amis.

101
00:05:12,281 --> 00:05:13,281
Sergeant Amis, Dana Walsh, CTU.

102
00:05:13,349 --> 00:05:15,150
Been waiting on you, Ms. Walsh.

103
00:05:15,218 --> 00:05:16,651
We're in our staging area already.

104
00:05:16,719 --> 00:05:17,986
Go ahead, Jack.

105
00:05:18,054 --> 00:05:19,154
Sergeant Amis, Jack Bauer.

106
00:05:19,222 --> 00:05:21,990
Our target, Tarin Faroush,
is in room 514.

107
00:05:22,058 --> 00:05:23,692
He has a female hostage,
Kayla Hassan.

108
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,228
She's the daughter of
President Hassan of the IRK.

109
00:05:26,295 --> 00:05:27,696
We'll handle him, Mr. Bauer.

110
00:05:27,763 --> 00:05:30,198
We'll make sure that girl
doesn't come to any harm.

111
00:05:30,266 --> 00:05:31,600
The priority is to
take Tarin alive.

112
00:05:31,667 --> 00:05:32,767
He's our only lead to a major

113
00:05:32,835 --> 00:05:33,802
terrorist threat against New York.

114
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,003
Like I said, we'll handle him.

115
00:05:35,071 --> 00:05:36,471
Sergeant, don't
underestimate this man.

116
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:37,906
He was President Hassan's
head of security.

117
00:05:37,974 --> 00:05:39,441
He knows what he's doing.

118
00:05:39,509 --> 00:05:41,576
I want your men to set up a
perimeter and wait for us.

119
00:05:41,644 --> 00:05:43,078
We're monitoring hotel security.

120
00:05:43,146 --> 00:05:44,246
We'll give you a heads-up

121
00:05:44,313 --> 00:05:45,480
if we've got any
action from the room.

122
00:05:49,452 --> 00:05:51,186
Kayla, my friend from
the State Department

123
00:05:51,254 --> 00:05:53,488
is waiting for us! We must go now.

124
00:05:53,556 --> 00:05:55,724
Just one more second, please.

125
00:06:18,214 --> 00:06:19,381
Kayla!

126
00:06:21,884 --> 00:06:23,351
Kayla!

127
00:06:24,654 --> 00:06:26,755
Tarin, what are you doing?!

128
00:06:26,822 --> 00:06:28,323
Stop this game.
We walk out of here right now.

129
00:06:28,391 --> 00:06:29,491
No, I'm not going anywhere.

130
00:06:29,559 --> 00:06:30,525
Just move! Oh, no!

131
00:06:30,593 --> 00:06:32,027
Where are you taking me?

132
00:06:32,094 --> 00:06:33,595
Believe me, the last thing
I want to do is hurt you,

133
00:06:33,663 --> 00:06:34,829
but I will.

134
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,935
Got movement on the fifth floor.

135
00:06:40,002 --> 00:06:41,403
Are you getting this, Jack?

136
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:43,572
Yeah, someone must've
tipped him off. Sergeant?

137
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:44,706
Yes, I know, target's on the move.

138
00:06:44,774 --> 00:06:45,840
I'm going in.

139
00:06:45,908 --> 00:06:46,975
Negative. We're five minutes out.

140
00:06:47,043 --> 00:06:48,276
I want you to hold your position.

141
00:06:48,344 --> 00:06:50,679
I'm on the ground, Mr.
Bauer; it's my call.

142
00:06:50,746 --> 00:06:52,247
No, it isn't,
this is a CTU operation.

143
00:06:52,315 --> 00:06:53,949
I am telling you to
hold your position.

144
00:06:54,016 --> 00:06:55,550
I'm going in. Sergeant!

145
00:06:59,655 --> 00:07:00,789
Tarin's at the elevators.

146
00:07:07,763 --> 00:07:09,664
Lost picture on the fifth.
Sergeant, target has

147
00:07:09,732 --> 00:07:12,467
taken out elevator security
camera and is armed.

148
00:07:12,535 --> 00:07:14,135
I am ordering you to stand down.

149
00:07:14,203 --> 00:07:15,237
I'm right on him.

150
00:07:15,304 --> 00:07:16,571
Sergeant, that was an order!

151
00:07:23,746 --> 00:07:25,880
Sergeant Amis, can you hear me?

152
00:07:25,948 --> 00:07:27,382
Ser- Chloe, have you got anything!?

153
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:28,917
Nothing.

154
00:07:49,305 --> 00:07:50,939
OFFICER Shots fired, shots fired.

155
00:07:51,007 --> 00:07:54,142
We have shots fired.
All NYPD units report status.

156
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:57,145
Repeat, report status.

157
00:07:57,213 --> 00:07:58,780
This is Faulkner. I'm hit.

158
00:07:58,848 --> 00:08:00,782
Amis and Martin are down.
Where's the target?

159
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:02,817
He's heading toward the fire
escape on the south side.

160
00:08:02,885 --> 00:08:04,319
He's got the girl.

161
00:08:04,387 --> 00:08:07,122
ESU, this is Agent Ortiz.
Cover the south fire escape now!

162
00:08:07,189 --> 00:08:08,690
Medics, men down
on the fifth floor.

163
00:08:08,758 --> 00:08:10,859
That doesn't make sense.
What do you mean?

164
00:08:10,926 --> 00:08:12,260
Tarin just took out three men.

165
00:08:12,328 --> 00:08:13,395
Why's he using the fire escape?

166
00:08:13,462 --> 00:08:14,729
He should be heading
down the stairs.

167
00:08:14,797 --> 00:08:16,631
Son of a bitch.

168
00:08:16,699 --> 00:08:19,668
NYPD, target is impersonating
an officer; he has the girl.

169
00:08:19,735 --> 00:08:21,936
I want you to fall back
and cover all exits.

170
00:08:22,004 --> 00:08:24,439
I repeat, target is
impersonating an officer.

171
00:08:24,507 --> 00:08:25,674
Cover all exits!

172
00:08:31,814 --> 00:08:33,715
Chloe, do you see anything?
Nothing.

173
00:08:33,783 --> 00:08:36,584
Send us back the drone feed.
Roger that.

174
00:08:39,455 --> 00:08:40,722
Drop the gun!

175
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:41,923
Put it down! No, no!

176
00:08:41,991 --> 00:08:42,957
Drop it now! This is Bellow.

177
00:08:43,025 --> 00:08:44,292
Target's at the Allen Street exit.

178
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,394
He's got the girl.
Chloe, we need that drone feed.

179
00:08:46,462 --> 00:08:47,595
Coming through.

180
00:08:47,663 --> 00:08:50,665
There's a cab pulling up.

181
00:08:50,733 --> 00:08:53,168
Officer Bellow, behind you!

182
00:08:58,774 --> 00:09:00,041
They're heading for the cab.

183
00:09:00,109 --> 00:09:01,376
All ESU, we have

184
00:09:01,444 --> 00:09:03,378
two officers down in the
alley behind the hotel.

185
00:09:03,446 --> 00:09:05,113
Target is moving to Allen Street.

186
00:09:05,181 --> 00:09:07,716
He's escaping in the yellow cab.
Tracking the cab.

187
00:09:07,783 --> 00:09:09,918
Go!

188
00:09:11,153 --> 00:09:12,487
Advise all NYPD mobile units,

189
00:09:12,555 --> 00:09:13,988
we cannot lose that vehicle.

190
00:09:14,056 --> 00:09:16,591
On it. Taxi's in the
Delancey underpass.

191
00:09:16,659 --> 00:09:18,660
I'm blind. Do we have traffic cams?

192
00:09:18,728 --> 00:09:20,228
Not in the underpass.

193
00:09:20,296 --> 00:09:21,329
We're two blocks from Delancey.

194
00:09:28,237 --> 00:09:30,305
Any sign of the cab?
Still in the underpass.

195
00:09:30,373 --> 00:09:32,107
The underpass is less
than half a click.

196
00:09:32,174 --> 00:09:33,608
Where the hell are they?

197
00:09:33,676 --> 00:09:35,410
NYPD mobile units, 90 seconds out.

198
00:09:35,478 --> 00:09:37,445
Go left, Jack, go left right here!

199
00:09:52,862 --> 00:09:55,497
There it is. I got the cab.
I got the cab.

200
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,975
Driver!

201
00:10:07,042 --> 00:10:09,144
I want you to slowly
open your door!

202
00:10:12,948 --> 00:10:15,683
Open the door now!

203
00:10:20,356 --> 00:10:22,290
It's empty.

204
00:10:22,358 --> 00:10:24,325
It's empty!

205
00:10:24,393 --> 00:10:26,094
Chloe, backtrack drone footage.

206
00:10:26,162 --> 00:10:27,929
Trace every vehicle
that left the underpass.

207
00:10:27,997 --> 00:10:29,097
Get NYPD to set roadblocks.

208
00:10:29,165 --> 00:10:30,832
They were here less
than 30 seconds ago!

209
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,267
Arlo? Got it.

210
00:10:32,334 --> 00:10:34,869
We should join the sweep.
No, they're gone.

211
00:10:34,937 --> 00:10:37,305
You don't know that.
Yeah, I do, they're gone.

212
00:10:37,373 --> 00:10:39,007
Chloe, it's Jack,
I'm gonna need a kidnap

213
00:10:39,074 --> 00:10:40,141
and an electronic
intercept package.

214
00:10:40,209 --> 00:10:42,143
Have it meet me back
at the UN. Copy.

215
00:10:42,211 --> 00:10:44,145
I need to talk to President Hassan.

216
00:10:44,213 --> 00:10:46,448
That's who the terrorists are
gonna want to contact next.

217
00:10:46,515 --> 00:10:48,286
That's why they
kidnapped his daughter.

218
00:11:08,971 --> 00:11:10,305
Tarin just called.

219
00:11:10,372 --> 00:11:11,706
He has the girl.

220
00:11:20,015 --> 00:11:21,416
Hello.

221
00:11:21,484 --> 00:11:23,518
Ahman. Samir,
where are the nuclear rods?

222
00:11:23,586 --> 00:11:25,487
They're still outside the city.

223
00:11:25,554 --> 00:11:28,423
We haven't disabled the American
radiological detectors yet.

224
00:11:28,491 --> 00:11:31,426
Then how will you
bring the rods to me?

225
00:11:31,494 --> 00:11:34,062
It's been taken care of.

226
00:11:45,336 --> 00:11:46,903
Here, Mr. Prady. Thank you.

227
00:11:46,971 --> 00:11:49,272
Give me one moment. Yeah.

228
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:51,208
We've backtracked through
drone and traffic cam footage

229
00:11:51,275 --> 00:11:52,409
looking for Kayla and Tarin.

230
00:11:52,476 --> 00:11:53,643
Nothing's come up yet.

231
00:11:53,711 --> 00:11:54,844
What's Bauer's status?

232
00:11:54,912 --> 00:11:56,112
He's two minutes from the UN.

233
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:58,081
An electronic intercept
team is en route to him.

234
00:11:58,149 --> 00:11:59,382
Keep me informed.

235
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:00,884
Copy.

236
00:12:00,952 --> 00:12:02,652
Ms. Walsh.

237
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,287
There's a Mr.
Prady here to see you.

238
00:12:04,355 --> 00:12:05,922
Says he spoke to you on the phone.

239
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:07,257
Thank you.

240
00:12:11,529 --> 00:12:13,730
Chloe.

241
00:12:13,798 --> 00:12:17,267
Would you mind covering
for me for a few minutes?

242
00:12:40,057 --> 00:12:41,324
Mr. Prady.

243
00:12:41,392 --> 00:12:43,260
Dana Walsh. A pleasure, Ms. Walsh.

244
00:12:43,327 --> 00:12:44,694
It'll be quieter in here.

245
00:12:44,762 --> 00:12:46,830
Mm-hmm.

246
00:12:46,897 --> 00:12:49,633
Uh, this is, uh...

247
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,968
this is some impressive facility.

248
00:12:52,036 --> 00:12:53,670
What, uh...

249
00:12:53,738 --> 00:12:55,338
what is it you do here?

250
00:12:57,008 --> 00:12:59,309
Intelligence analyst.

251
00:12:59,377 --> 00:13:01,544
Mr. Prady, we've got a
major situation here...

252
00:13:01,612 --> 00:13:04,447
I understand. I won't
take up much of your time.

253
00:13:04,515 --> 00:13:05,982
Okay.

254
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:09,319
It's 3:00 in the morning,
you're 2,000 miles from home.

255
00:13:09,387 --> 00:13:10,887
You mind telling me
what's so urgent?

256
00:13:10,955 --> 00:13:12,289
Yeah. It's about the young man

257
00:13:12,356 --> 00:13:15,458
I mentioned on the phone-
Kevin Wade.

258
00:13:15,526 --> 00:13:17,560
This is him right here.

259
00:13:27,938 --> 00:13:29,606
You know him, don't you?

260
00:13:31,709 --> 00:13:33,209
Yes.

261
00:13:35,813 --> 00:13:39,482
I should have been honest
with you on the phone.

262
00:13:41,886 --> 00:13:45,388
I met Kevin a couple
days ago at a bar.

263
00:13:45,456 --> 00:13:47,724
Was there another man with him?

264
00:13:47,792 --> 00:13:49,426
He was traveling

265
00:13:49,493 --> 00:13:51,561
with an ex-con named Nick Coughlin.

266
00:13:51,629 --> 00:13:53,263
Bad news.

267
00:13:53,331 --> 00:13:56,800
Done time on robbery,
attempted murder.

268
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:02,972
No. No, I've never seen him.

269
00:14:06,344 --> 00:14:08,378
Okay.

270
00:14:08,446 --> 00:14:13,450
So, what happened...
with you and Kevin?

271
00:14:15,453 --> 00:14:18,655
Um...

272
00:14:18,723 --> 00:14:22,359
we talked for a while.

273
00:14:22,426 --> 00:14:24,661
I drank more than I should,

274
00:14:24,729 --> 00:14:26,830
and we ended up back in his van.

275
00:14:26,897 --> 00:14:28,598
You had sex with him.

276
00:14:30,735 --> 00:14:32,168
Yes.

277
00:14:32,236 --> 00:14:34,337
Do you know where he is now?

278
00:14:36,607 --> 00:14:38,308
No. I didn't see him again.

279
00:14:38,376 --> 00:14:39,943
The whole thing was a mistake.

280
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:42,312
Why so?

281
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:46,149
Because I am getting
married in a few weeks.

282
00:14:46,217 --> 00:14:47,617
It was the pressure.

283
00:14:47,685 --> 00:14:48,918
I- I don't know.

284
00:14:48,986 --> 00:14:51,154
All the wedding plans.

285
00:14:51,222 --> 00:14:52,522
I went out for a drink.

286
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:55,592
I didn't intend to...

287
00:14:55,659 --> 00:14:58,161
Maybe I did. I don't know.

288
00:14:59,663 --> 00:15:01,064
I don't know anything anymore.

289
00:15:01,132 --> 00:15:03,566
All that I know is that
if my fiancÃfÂ© finds out,

290
00:15:03,634 --> 00:15:04,968
he will never forgive me.

291
00:15:05,035 --> 00:15:06,603
I'm not looking to ruin your life.

292
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:08,705
I just want to retrieve Kevin

293
00:15:08,773 --> 00:15:10,807
before he gets in more trouble

294
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:13,176
than violating his parole.

295
00:15:16,647 --> 00:15:17,714
I understand.

296
00:15:17,782 --> 00:15:19,616
I... I hope that you find him.

297
00:15:19,683 --> 00:15:21,818
Yeah, thing is, Miss Walsh,

298
00:15:21,886 --> 00:15:24,254
I got a call a couple hours ago

299
00:15:24,321 --> 00:15:27,090
from my NYPD friend, Tom Hardiman.

300
00:15:27,158 --> 00:15:30,393
Seems like there was a...
a break-in

301
00:15:30,461 --> 00:15:32,028
at a police evidence lockup.

302
00:15:32,096 --> 00:15:34,798
Again, bad business.

303
00:15:34,865 --> 00:15:36,633
Officer got beaten up,
left in a coma,

304
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:37,967
but guess whose prints

305
00:15:38,035 --> 00:15:40,770
were on the assault weapon?

306
00:15:40,838 --> 00:15:43,973
Yeah, that nasty SOB,
Nick Coughlin.

307
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:46,242
Now, what I'm afraid of is...

308
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:48,511
where Nick is, Kevin is, too,

309
00:15:48,579 --> 00:15:50,547
and I really need to find him.

310
00:15:50,614 --> 00:15:53,383
And, like I told you,
I only saw him the once.

311
00:15:53,451 --> 00:15:55,618
I have no idea where he is.

312
00:15:57,655 --> 00:15:59,322
And you're sure about that?

313
00:16:00,891 --> 00:16:05,261
Mr. Prady, we are in the middle
of a national security crisis.

314
00:16:05,329 --> 00:16:06,896
I have to go back to my desk.

315
00:16:06,964 --> 00:16:08,131
Okay. Okay.

316
00:16:08,199 --> 00:16:09,499
I'm sorry.

317
00:16:09,567 --> 00:16:11,201
Perhaps, if I talk
to your supervisor,

318
00:16:11,268 --> 00:16:15,038
he could let you take
a few minutes off.

319
00:16:18,275 --> 00:16:21,511
Or I could wait here,

320
00:16:21,579 --> 00:16:25,014
stay out of your way
till you have some time.

321
00:16:25,082 --> 00:16:26,483
Fine.

322
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:28,151
You have to stay here, though.

323
00:16:28,219 --> 00:16:30,153
Of course.

324
00:16:30,221 --> 00:16:31,955
Okay. Mm-hmm.

325
00:16:36,026 --> 00:16:37,026
I don't understand.

326
00:16:37,094 --> 00:16:38,828
The Americans knew where Kayla was.

327
00:16:38,896 --> 00:16:40,497
How did they lose her?

328
00:16:40,564 --> 00:16:42,432
Before we blame them, remember...

329
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,300
it was our people- our own people-

330
00:16:44,368 --> 00:16:46,970
who kidnapped Kayla,
not the Americans.

331
00:16:48,739 --> 00:16:51,774
Mr. President, CTU is here.

332
00:16:55,246 --> 00:16:56,880
Mr. President, I'm Jack Bauer.

333
00:16:56,947 --> 00:16:58,414
You already know Cole Ortiz.

334
00:16:58,482 --> 00:17:00,049
We deeply regret not being able

335
00:17:00,117 --> 00:17:01,518
to find your daughter,
but I promise you,

336
00:17:01,585 --> 00:17:02,552
we're going to do everything

337
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:03,887
in our power to recover her.

338
00:17:03,954 --> 00:17:06,055
How did you lose her?
How did that happen?

339
00:17:06,123 --> 00:17:07,690
Tarin had been warned, ma'am.
We arrived too late.

340
00:17:07,758 --> 00:17:08,892
It was your people...

341
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:10,093
Dalia, please.

342
00:17:12,563 --> 00:17:14,163
What do they want with Kayla?

343
00:17:14,231 --> 00:17:15,698
We were hoping you
could tell us, sir.

344
00:17:15,766 --> 00:17:18,334
Tarin Faroush was
your head of security,

345
00:17:18,402 --> 00:17:19,836
meaning he knows
everything that you know.

346
00:17:19,904 --> 00:17:21,337
He took your daughter
because he's trying

347
00:17:21,405 --> 00:17:23,172
to leverage something from you.
Do you have

348
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,574
any idea what that could be?

349
00:17:24,642 --> 00:17:25,909
I don't know.

350
00:17:25,976 --> 00:17:27,243
Sir,

351
00:17:27,311 --> 00:17:29,245
we believe the kidnappers
will contact you directly.

352
00:17:29,313 --> 00:17:31,581
We need to set up monitoring
devices on your phones

353
00:17:31,649 --> 00:17:32,815
so we can track their call.

354
00:17:32,883 --> 00:17:34,517
Do what you need to do.
Just, please,

355
00:17:34,585 --> 00:17:36,219
get our child back.

356
00:17:36,287 --> 00:17:37,287
Dalia.

357
00:17:37,354 --> 00:17:38,454
Please.

358
00:17:38,522 --> 00:17:39,589
Thank you.

359
00:17:39,657 --> 00:17:41,357
With me.

360
00:17:44,895 --> 00:17:46,796
Set up tech here.

361
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,901
Tarin! Don't.

362
00:17:51,969 --> 00:17:53,636
Please.

363
00:17:55,539 --> 00:17:57,106
Don't. Come on.

364
00:17:57,174 --> 00:17:59,542
Please.

365
00:18:07,451 --> 00:18:10,053
Do what he says,
and you won't get hurt.

366
00:18:11,255 --> 00:18:12,422
Who is he?

367
00:18:12,489 --> 00:18:14,123
Another traitor?

368
00:18:20,998 --> 00:18:24,267
The only traitor is your father.

369
00:18:26,103 --> 00:18:28,171
Tie her up.

370
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:31,874
No.

371
00:18:31,942 --> 00:18:34,010
No. No. No.

372
00:18:59,431 --> 00:19:00,965
Do you recognize the number?

373
00:19:01,033 --> 00:19:03,334
There isn't one.
Chloe, we've got a call

374
00:19:03,402 --> 00:19:05,036
coming in on the
mother's cell phone.

375
00:19:05,103 --> 00:19:07,705
We're working on it.

376
00:19:07,773 --> 00:19:08,873
Answer it.

377
00:19:08,941 --> 00:19:11,676
Keep them on the phone
as long as possible.

378
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:13,311
Yes?

379
00:19:13,378 --> 00:19:15,846
Your husband is a traitor to
the people of the Republic.

380
00:19:15,914 --> 00:19:18,749
He alone has made our
actions necessary.

381
00:19:18,817 --> 00:19:20,518
He cannot be trusted.

382
00:19:20,586 --> 00:19:22,086
Where is my daughter?

383
00:19:22,154 --> 00:19:24,155
I want to talk to her.

384
00:19:24,223 --> 00:19:27,592
Whether you ever see
her again depends

385
00:19:27,659 --> 00:19:30,127
on what your husband
does right now.

386
00:19:30,195 --> 00:19:31,395
Put him on. Dalia?

387
00:19:31,463 --> 00:19:32,763
They want to talk to you.

388
00:19:32,831 --> 00:19:33,998
Here, give me the phone.

389
00:19:34,066 --> 00:19:35,066
We need to be hearing this.

390
00:19:35,133 --> 00:19:36,467
We're still working on it, Jack.

391
00:19:36,535 --> 00:19:39,403
Okay, we've got it.
You should have audio.

392
00:19:39,471 --> 00:19:41,472
This is President Hassan.

393
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:43,274
Who are you?

394
00:19:43,342 --> 00:19:44,842
I'm a loyal servant of the Republic

395
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:46,310
you are trying to destroy.

396
00:19:46,378 --> 00:19:48,346
Now, shut up, Omar, and listen.

397
00:19:48,413 --> 00:19:50,047
I want to lk to my daughter.

398
00:19:50,115 --> 00:19:53,084
Let me tell you what I want.

399
00:19:53,151 --> 00:19:55,286
File 33.

400
00:19:57,155 --> 00:19:58,489
File 33.

401
00:19:58,557 --> 00:20:00,658
That is the price of your daughter.

402
00:20:00,726 --> 00:20:02,760
I don't know what that is.

403
00:20:02,828 --> 00:20:04,428
You had to say that.

404
00:20:04,496 --> 00:20:06,097
Of course.

405
00:20:06,164 --> 00:20:08,599
You're a vain man,

406
00:20:08,667 --> 00:20:10,101
concerned about appearances,

407
00:20:10,168 --> 00:20:12,937
and the Americans are listening.

408
00:20:13,972 --> 00:20:16,274
But please...

409
00:20:16,341 --> 00:20:19,310
do not insult me by
saying this again.

410
00:20:19,378 --> 00:20:22,113
I won't say anything until
I talk to my daughter.

411
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,948
Fine.

412
00:20:24,016 --> 00:20:26,417
If that's what you want.

413
00:20:26,485 --> 00:20:28,519
I'm sending you an IP address.

414
00:20:28,587 --> 00:20:30,988
Give it to one of the
people listening in.

415
00:20:39,598 --> 00:20:40,898
Okay, got it.

416
00:20:50,609 --> 00:20:52,109
Don't hurt her.

417
00:20:52,177 --> 00:20:53,644
It's me you want.

418
00:20:58,283 --> 00:20:59,884
I told you what I want.

419
00:20:59,951 --> 00:21:02,186
File 33.

420
00:21:02,254 --> 00:21:04,655
I told you-
I don't know what that is.

421
00:21:04,723 --> 00:21:06,490
Take me instead.

422
00:21:14,066 --> 00:21:15,499
You have 15 minutes.

423
00:21:15,567 --> 00:21:16,701
No excuses, no stalling.

424
00:21:16,768 --> 00:21:18,636
15 minutes or she dies here,
like this,

425
00:21:18,704 --> 00:21:19,770
while you watch.

426
00:21:19,838 --> 00:21:21,038
Stop it.

427
00:21:21,106 --> 00:21:22,473
Stop it!

428
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:25,009
I'll find the file. Whatever it is,

429
00:21:25,077 --> 00:21:26,010
I'll get it for you!

430
00:21:32,317 --> 00:21:33,484
Mr. President,

431
00:21:33,552 --> 00:21:34,852
what is File 33?

432
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,153
Omar! Mr. Bauer,

433
00:21:36,221 --> 00:21:39,023
I've got Brian
Hastings on the line.

434
00:21:41,259 --> 00:21:42,693
Yeah.

435
00:21:42,761 --> 00:21:44,595
Jack, you know anything
about this file?

436
00:21:44,663 --> 00:21:46,597
No, but I'm standing here
with President Hassan.

437
00:21:46,665 --> 00:21:47,998
I'll put you on speaker.

438
00:21:48,066 --> 00:21:49,100
Go ahead.

439
00:21:49,167 --> 00:21:50,501
Mr. President,
this is Brian Hastings.

440
00:21:50,569 --> 00:21:52,603
I have no intel on the
file they're talking about.

441
00:21:52,671 --> 00:21:54,138
Can you tell me what this is?

442
00:21:57,008 --> 00:21:58,542
Sir, they gave you 15 minutes.

443
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:00,444
If you want to see your daughter again,
you don't have time

444
00:22:00,512 --> 00:22:01,712
to waste.

445
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:03,781
Omar, what is this file?

446
00:22:13,358 --> 00:22:15,393
Show them.

447
00:22:17,696 --> 00:22:19,230
Show them!

448
00:22:25,237 --> 00:22:27,171
Dalia,

449
00:22:27,239 --> 00:22:29,173
I'll do anything for Kayla.

450
00:22:29,241 --> 00:22:30,674
I would give

451
00:22:30,742 --> 00:22:31,675
my own life.

452
00:22:31,743 --> 00:22:33,077
Then give them this file.

453
00:22:33,145 --> 00:22:35,146
Sir?

454
00:22:54,132 --> 00:22:57,168
Put it up on the screen,
mirror it over to CTU.

455
00:23:04,309 --> 00:23:06,744
Hastings, are you seeing this?

456
00:23:06,812 --> 00:23:08,779
Yes, I am.

457
00:23:08,847 --> 00:23:10,281
Mr. President,

458
00:23:10,348 --> 00:23:12,516
this file appears to
contain operational details

459
00:23:12,584 --> 00:23:15,119
of all U.S. anti-nuclear defenses.

460
00:23:15,187 --> 00:23:16,487
That's correct.

461
00:23:16,555 --> 00:23:19,390
Including our radiological
detection arrays.

462
00:23:19,458 --> 00:23:22,326
This is highly-
classified DOD material.

463
00:23:22,394 --> 00:23:24,428
I need to know how you got this.

464
00:23:24,496 --> 00:23:26,130
How do you think, Mr. Hastings?

465
00:23:27,699 --> 00:23:31,368
For 20 years, your nation
has threatened mine

466
00:23:31,436 --> 00:23:33,170
with everything from
economic sanctions

467
00:23:33,238 --> 00:23:35,306
to military attack.

468
00:23:35,373 --> 00:23:37,541
So we gathered intelligence

469
00:23:37,609 --> 00:23:39,610
and found weaknesses
in your defenses.

470
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:44,114
We did what any other
country would do.

471
00:23:44,182 --> 00:23:45,850
Mr. President,

472
00:23:45,917 --> 00:23:48,118
that file shows the fatal flaws

473
00:23:48,186 --> 00:23:50,020
of our nuclear
detection capabilities.

474
00:23:50,088 --> 00:23:51,856
If the terrorists were to get that,

475
00:23:51,923 --> 00:23:54,091
they could smuggle the
fuel rods into Manhattan.

476
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:55,259
Surely you understand,

477
00:23:55,327 --> 00:23:57,294
we cannot let you
give that to them.

478
00:23:57,362 --> 00:23:59,430
We're talking about the lives
of tens of thousands of people.

479
00:23:59,498 --> 00:24:00,664
And what of my daughter?

480
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,601
What of her life?

481
00:24:03,668 --> 00:24:07,671
With all due respect, madam,
your family brought this threat

482
00:24:07,739 --> 00:24:09,039
to my country.

483
00:24:09,107 --> 00:24:11,475
We're doing the best we can.

484
00:24:11,543 --> 00:24:12,776
Jack, you still on?

485
00:24:12,844 --> 00:24:14,512
Yeah, we all are.

486
00:24:14,579 --> 00:24:16,547
Jack, we may have a lead
on the daughter's location.

487
00:24:16,615 --> 00:24:18,382
Arlo isolated a subway
noise from the video feed

488
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:20,718
at the end of the transmission,
cross-referencing it with

489
00:24:20,785 --> 00:24:22,152
the real-time train
positions as of this moment.

490
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:23,921
There aren't a lot of
trains this late at night,

491
00:24:23,989 --> 00:24:25,823
especially within the radius that

492
00:24:25,891 --> 00:24:28,058
they could have traveled to. They were
heading southeast when they left the hotel.

493
00:24:28,126 --> 00:24:29,660
They've got to be
near the F train stop

494
00:24:29,728 --> 00:24:30,895
by the Williamsburg Bridge.

495
00:24:30,962 --> 00:24:33,163
Copy that. Cole and I
will head down there now.

496
00:24:33,231 --> 00:24:35,032
We'll bring Tac from here.
You need me to send a second team?

497
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,468
Yes, and aerial.
Everything you've got.

498
00:24:37,536 --> 00:24:39,403
Have your men ready and assembled
in five minutes. Right away.

499
00:24:39,471 --> 00:24:42,139
Mr. President, we're going
to need you to stall them

500
00:24:42,207 --> 00:24:43,574
when they call back. How?

501
00:24:43,642 --> 00:24:45,409
We'll set up a fake file
that you can transmit.

502
00:24:45,477 --> 00:24:47,077
They'll see through that,
Mr. Bauer.

503
00:24:47,145 --> 00:24:49,079
Eventually, but right
now we just need you

504
00:24:49,147 --> 00:24:51,081
to stall them long enough so
we can locate your daughter.

505
00:24:51,149 --> 00:24:53,150
Stall them any way you can,
but you need to make this work.

506
00:24:53,218 --> 00:24:54,852
We will do whatever we have to.

507
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,087
Thank you.

508
00:25:38,163 --> 00:25:40,097
Tarin.

509
00:25:40,165 --> 00:25:41,098
Please, don't say...

510
00:25:41,166 --> 00:25:42,232
Why are you doing this? Please.

511
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,534
Why are you doing this?

512
00:25:43,602 --> 00:25:45,536
Please don't say anything more.

513
00:25:45,604 --> 00:25:47,605
Please.

514
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:11,562
Is there trouble? No.
Why would there be?

515
00:26:14,199 --> 00:26:15,432
What's the problem?

516
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,301
They're never going to
hand over that file.

517
00:26:17,369 --> 00:26:18,969
They have to. And if they don't?!

518
00:26:19,037 --> 00:26:21,005
Killing her was not
part of the plan.

519
00:26:21,072 --> 00:26:22,272
You were willing to die

520
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:23,707
in Hassan's limousine
earlier today.

521
00:26:23,775 --> 00:26:25,909
You were willing to do
anything for our cause.

522
00:26:25,977 --> 00:26:27,911
I still am.

523
00:26:27,979 --> 00:26:29,246
You assured me your feelings

524
00:26:29,314 --> 00:26:31,815
for this girl would
not get in the way.

525
00:26:31,883 --> 00:26:35,285
So tell me,

526
00:26:35,353 --> 00:26:38,055
do I need someone else
to take care of her?

527
00:26:43,428 --> 00:26:45,462
No.

528
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:47,097
Stay strong.

529
00:26:48,133 --> 00:26:50,134
We're almost there.

530
00:27:16,242 --> 00:27:18,343
Arlo, what's the status
on our target area?

531
00:27:18,411 --> 00:27:20,078
Still looking at almost
six square blocks.

532
00:27:20,146 --> 00:27:21,847
How far out are Jack and Cole?

533
00:27:21,915 --> 00:27:22,848
Six minutes.

534
00:27:22,916 --> 00:27:24,082
That leaves us about 30 seconds

535
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:25,250
to find her.

536
00:27:25,318 --> 00:27:26,485
We've got to narrow this down.

537
00:27:26,553 --> 00:27:28,787
Where's the second Tac team?
Leaving now.

538
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:30,822
Uh... Dana?

539
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:32,624
Huh?

540
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:33,692
Who is that?

541
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:39,231
Nobody.

542
00:27:41,534 --> 00:27:43,202
Mr. Prady, this is a secure area.

543
00:27:43,269 --> 00:27:44,937
If you're not gonna
wait in holding,

544
00:27:45,004 --> 00:27:46,305
I'm gonna have to ask you

545
00:27:46,372 --> 00:27:48,307
to leave. I'm sorry.
I had a question.

546
00:27:48,374 --> 00:27:50,742
And I'm in the middle of a situation.
I don't have time.

547
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:52,277
Well, I wouldn't be bothering you,

548
00:27:52,345 --> 00:27:54,313
but I just got off the
phone with my NYPD friend.

549
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:56,048
He said I absolutely
have to ask you

550
00:27:56,115 --> 00:27:58,717
about the security cameras at
the police evidence lockup.

551
00:27:58,785 --> 00:28:00,319
Because you know what?

552
00:28:00,386 --> 00:28:02,588
It turns out they malfunctioned

553
00:28:02,655 --> 00:28:04,623
for the exact duration
of the incident.

554
00:28:04,691 --> 00:28:07,793
Well, somebody obviously
disabled the cameras.

555
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:09,294
Well, yeah, but not Nick and Kevin.

556
00:28:09,362 --> 00:28:12,464
I mean, a crowbar is about as
high-tech as those two get.

557
00:28:12,532 --> 00:28:14,800
Now, that's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

558
00:28:14,867 --> 00:28:18,503
See, I'm thinking that someone
must have helped them.

559
00:28:25,011 --> 00:28:28,013
Now, my friend says
that all the raw video

560
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:32,184
from every government facility
feeds right here into CTU.

561
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:33,819
Am I understanding that right?

562
00:28:33,886 --> 00:28:35,787
Yes. He also said-

563
00:28:35,855 --> 00:28:38,523
correct me if I'm wrong- that

564
00:28:38,591 --> 00:28:40,926
the digital images
are archived every

565
00:28:40,994 --> 00:28:43,629
eight hours, and metadata-

566
00:28:43,696 --> 00:28:45,230
is that what it's called,
metadata?-

567
00:28:45,298 --> 00:28:47,332
that allows you to trace

568
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:51,203
the exact source of
any service outage.

569
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:54,573
So, everything I need to
solve this is right here.

570
00:28:54,641 --> 00:28:56,875
You can get it for me, right?

571
00:28:56,943 --> 00:29:00,012
Mr. Prady, we don't just give
data to people off the street.

572
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:01,179
Well, now, that's right.

573
00:29:01,247 --> 00:29:02,347
That's right.

574
00:29:02,415 --> 00:29:05,550
You need, uh,
an IDRAN- an Interagency

575
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:08,186
Data Request Authorization Number.

576
00:29:08,254 --> 00:29:10,422
Yeah, Hardiman gave
me one of those.

577
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:13,358
He said everything should fit

578
00:29:13,426 --> 00:29:15,694
on a 100-gig thumb drive.

579
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:18,697
So is that going to be a problem,

580
00:29:18,765 --> 00:29:19,998
getting that for me?

581
00:29:23,703 --> 00:29:26,638
No.

582
00:29:26,706 --> 00:29:28,674
Good.

583
00:29:34,113 --> 00:29:35,514
They reprocessed the subway noise,

584
00:29:35,581 --> 00:29:37,516
managed to narrow
down the search grid.

585
00:29:37,583 --> 00:29:38,684
How big?

586
00:29:38,751 --> 00:29:39,885
About 12 buildings total.

587
00:29:39,952 --> 00:29:41,353
Apartments, offices, retail.

588
00:29:41,421 --> 00:29:42,554
It's still too much
ground to cover.

589
00:29:45,425 --> 00:29:47,826
Agent Ortiz.

590
00:29:47,894 --> 00:29:49,695
Dana?

591
00:29:49,762 --> 00:29:52,898
Cole... it's over.

592
00:29:52,965 --> 00:29:54,800
I'm sorry.
I'm not sure I heard you.

593
00:29:54,867 --> 00:29:56,001
The parole officer looking

594
00:29:56,069 --> 00:29:57,703
for Kevin is here at CTU.

595
00:29:57,770 --> 00:29:59,304
Knows about the robbery,

596
00:29:59,372 --> 00:30:00,872
the cameras, everything.

597
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:02,107
Are you certain?

598
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:03,775
Yeah.

599
00:30:05,578 --> 00:30:07,546
He's after the raw feeds.

600
00:30:07,613 --> 00:30:10,482
He's got an interagency request.

601
00:30:13,686 --> 00:30:15,821
I'm going to give it to him, Cole.

602
00:30:15,888 --> 00:30:17,122
I'm sorry to call you.

603
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,323
I just thought

604
00:30:18,391 --> 00:30:19,458
that you should know.

605
00:30:19,525 --> 00:30:20,559
Why don't you wait?

606
00:30:20,626 --> 00:30:22,861
Do you hear me?
He knows everything.

607
00:30:22,929 --> 00:30:24,096
He'll go to Hastings.

608
00:30:24,163 --> 00:30:26,064
Don't do anything.
We'll talk about it

609
00:30:26,132 --> 00:30:27,899
when I get back.

610
00:30:27,967 --> 00:30:29,668
I can't wait.

611
00:30:29,736 --> 00:30:31,303
If you're here,

612
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:34,005
you'll just get in more
trouble trying to protect me.

613
00:30:36,275 --> 00:30:38,276
I can't let that happen.

614
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,682
I love you, Cole.

615
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:48,420
Dana? Dana?

616
00:30:48,488 --> 00:30:49,721
You got a problem? No.

617
00:30:49,789 --> 00:30:51,456
Good, 'cause I need you
to keep your head in this.

618
00:30:51,524 --> 00:30:52,457
You understand?

619
00:30:52,525 --> 00:30:54,459
You got it.

620
00:30:58,664 --> 00:31:00,699
Omar.

621
00:31:00,767 --> 00:31:03,235
We're running out of time.

622
00:31:03,302 --> 00:31:06,138
The technicians have prepared

623
00:31:06,205 --> 00:31:08,206
the file I'll be sending.

624
00:31:08,274 --> 00:31:10,909
But these people who have Kayla-

625
00:31:10,977 --> 00:31:13,245
they won't believe a fake file.

626
00:31:13,312 --> 00:31:14,246
No.

627
00:31:14,313 --> 00:31:16,581
But they might believe you.

628
00:31:18,818 --> 00:31:20,318
You have a gift, Omar.

629
00:31:20,386 --> 00:31:22,053
When you talk, people listen.

630
00:31:22,121 --> 00:31:25,257
You need to convince them,
for our daughter.

631
00:31:25,324 --> 00:31:28,627
Say whatever you
need to to buy time.

632
00:31:32,031 --> 00:31:35,567
I have seen you
move so many people.

633
00:31:35,635 --> 00:31:36,768
You can do this.

634
00:31:36,836 --> 00:31:38,303
I know it.

635
00:31:38,371 --> 00:31:40,806
Yeah.

636
00:31:40,873 --> 00:31:42,407
Mr. President?

637
00:31:42,475 --> 00:31:44,876
I'm sorry.

638
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:46,111
It's time.

639
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:07,899
The deadline is here.

640
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:09,968
Your father has not responded.

641
00:32:10,036 --> 00:32:11,837
You hate him that much,
you would do this

642
00:32:11,904 --> 00:32:14,206
to me?

643
00:32:16,542 --> 00:32:18,477
Tarin...

644
00:32:18,544 --> 00:32:20,545
I don't want to die.

645
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:31,189
Please.

646
00:32:31,257 --> 00:32:33,158
Then let us pray

647
00:32:33,226 --> 00:32:35,927
for once your father
does the right thing.

648
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:38,196
Tarin, you can't let them do this.

649
00:32:38,264 --> 00:32:39,397
I know you.

650
00:32:39,465 --> 00:32:40,565
Shh.

651
00:32:40,633 --> 00:32:42,367
This is not you.

652
00:32:42,435 --> 00:32:44,069
And I know in my heart

653
00:32:44,136 --> 00:32:45,871
that you love me.

654
00:32:45,938 --> 00:32:47,873
In my heart I know.

655
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:51,076
And so I don't understand why...

656
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:55,180
Nearly there, sir.

657
00:32:59,452 --> 00:33:01,686
Okay, the uplink's ready.

658
00:33:08,427 --> 00:33:10,428
Let's go.

659
00:33:12,098 --> 00:33:14,032
Stop them!

660
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:17,068
W- Wait, wait, wait.

661
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:23,441
Follow me.

662
00:33:34,053 --> 00:33:35,887
This way, come on.

663
00:33:35,955 --> 00:33:37,255
My father will help us.

664
00:33:37,323 --> 00:33:38,657
He's surrounded by traitors.

665
00:33:38,724 --> 00:33:40,725
We have to get to CTU.

666
00:33:48,367 --> 00:33:49,734
Here, the number is
in this cell phone.

667
00:33:49,802 --> 00:33:50,802
Call them.

668
00:33:51,737 --> 00:33:54,439
Tarin, no, no!

669
00:33:57,977 --> 00:34:00,245
Tarin, no!

670
00:34:00,313 --> 00:34:01,880
Tarin!

671
00:34:01,948 --> 00:34:02,948
No.

672
00:34:03,015 --> 00:34:04,983
Tarin!

673
00:34:33,624 --> 00:34:35,558
Omar, what has happened to her?

674
00:34:35,626 --> 00:34:38,127
Did the Americans stop the call?

675
00:34:38,195 --> 00:34:39,562
I don't know.

676
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:41,619
Maybe they were afraid we'd
hand over the real file.

677
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:45,702
They could have gotten
our daughter killed.

678
00:34:53,811 --> 00:34:55,545
Why aren't we seeing anything?
We're not sure.

679
00:34:55,613 --> 00:34:56,913
Arlo's been scanning
the audio source.

680
00:34:56,981 --> 00:34:59,416
Four minutes ago there
was a spike- very faint-

681
00:34:59,483 --> 00:35:00,417
sounded like a gunshot.

682
00:35:00,484 --> 00:35:01,618
Did Jack hear anything?

683
00:35:01,686 --> 00:35:03,220
No, but he's still a
quarter of a mile out.

684
00:35:03,287 --> 00:35:04,588
Mr. Hastings, you better take this.

685
00:35:04,656 --> 00:35:06,456
It's Kayla Hassan- she's in a car,
she's escaped.

686
00:35:06,524 --> 00:35:07,457
What?

687
00:35:07,525 --> 00:35:09,292
Go.

688
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,261
Ms. Hassan, Brian Hastings,
Director of CTU.

689
00:35:11,329 --> 00:35:13,830
You all right? No, no,
I'm not all right.

690
00:35:13,898 --> 00:35:15,032
I'm driving.

691
00:35:15,099 --> 00:35:17,134
They might be chasing me,
I don't know.

692
00:35:17,201 --> 00:35:18,869
Where are you? I don't know!

693
00:35:18,936 --> 00:35:20,303
Track her cell phone;
patch Jack in.

694
00:35:20,371 --> 00:35:22,939
Ms. Hassan, we're tracking
your cell phone right now.

695
00:35:23,007 --> 00:35:24,007
Do not turn it off.

696
00:35:24,075 --> 00:35:25,075
Just tell us what happened.

697
00:35:25,143 --> 00:35:26,943
They tried to kill me,
but Tarin got me out.

698
00:35:27,011 --> 00:35:29,246
He found a car, but they caught us.

699
00:35:29,313 --> 00:35:31,415
They shot him.

700
00:35:31,482 --> 00:35:33,083
He's dead.

701
00:35:33,151 --> 00:35:35,652
He told me to call CTU,

702
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,854
that it was the only safe place.

703
00:35:37,922 --> 00:35:39,623
Ms. Hassan, my name is Jack Bauer.

704
00:35:39,691 --> 00:35:41,391
We need to know where
you were being held.

705
00:35:41,459 --> 00:35:42,826
I don't know.

706
00:35:42,894 --> 00:35:44,928
Ma'am, look, I know you've
been through a great ordeal,

707
00:35:44,996 --> 00:35:47,030
but please, this is very important.

708
00:35:47,098 --> 00:35:49,499
Can you at least try to remember
what the building looked like?

709
00:35:49,567 --> 00:35:52,169
It was dark, and it was empty.

710
00:35:52,236 --> 00:35:55,505
It-It had a vault,
like a bank, but abandoned.

711
00:35:55,573 --> 00:35:56,540
Chloe, did you get that?

712
00:35:56,607 --> 00:35:57,941
Got it.

713
00:35:58,009 --> 00:36:01,645
You need to tell my father that
Tarin Faroush helped me escape,

714
00:36:01,713 --> 00:36:04,815
that he sacrificed his life for me.

715
00:36:04,882 --> 00:36:06,083
We've got the location, Jack.

716
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:09,052
Republic Commerce Bank,
9621 East Broadway.

717
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,353
It closed a year ago.

718
00:36:10,421 --> 00:36:11,722
It's the only bank on
the grid. Copy that.

719
00:36:11,789 --> 00:36:12,723
We're going to need drone support,

720
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:14,091
and send a second
team over to the bank.

721
00:36:14,158 --> 00:36:16,226
We got 'em.

722
00:36:16,294 --> 00:36:18,628
Ms. Hassan, we've got you on
First Avenue and East Fifth.

723
00:36:18,696 --> 00:36:21,498
Continue going straight,
I will tell you when to turn.

724
00:36:21,566 --> 00:36:22,766
Okay.

725
00:36:34,679 --> 00:36:36,646
You two cover this exit.

726
00:36:36,714 --> 00:36:38,715
When the second team gets here,
you send them down.

727
00:36:38,783 --> 00:36:40,150
Cole, you're with me.

728
00:36:40,218 --> 00:36:42,586
Let's take the door.

729
00:37:08,379 --> 00:37:11,414
* *

730
00:37:21,993 --> 00:37:24,261
Cole.

731
00:37:50,488 --> 00:37:53,523
* *

732
00:37:56,394 --> 00:37:58,328
Chloe, it's Jack.

733
00:37:58,396 --> 00:38:00,130
We're in the basement of the bank.

734
00:38:00,198 --> 00:38:01,431
There's some kind of tunnel system.

735
00:38:01,499 --> 00:38:04,367
I've got the schematics,
I'm seeing it now.

736
00:38:04,435 --> 00:38:05,368
We're going to head

737
00:38:05,436 --> 00:38:07,404
down a spur southeast
from the vault.

738
00:38:07,471 --> 00:38:08,872
How many exit points?

739
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:11,074
Two exits- no, three.

740
00:38:11,142 --> 00:38:14,077
Have the drone cover
all the exit points.

741
00:38:14,145 --> 00:38:16,046
Arlo, I'm sending
you my screen now.

742
00:38:16,113 --> 00:38:17,681
Can you get eyes on all the exits?

743
00:38:17,748 --> 00:38:20,317
Yeah, ascending to 5,000.

744
00:38:45,042 --> 00:38:47,677
I got movement at the south exit.

745
00:38:49,547 --> 00:38:51,481
I've got four hostiles
approaching Division Street

746
00:38:51,549 --> 00:38:52,816
on foot, heading northeast.

747
00:38:52,884 --> 00:38:54,751
You copy? Yeah.

748
00:38:54,819 --> 00:38:55,752
Cole, they double-backed

749
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:57,053
up top.

750
00:38:57,121 --> 00:39:00,223
Chloe, we're moving to intercept.

751
00:39:00,291 --> 00:39:01,658
Where's Kayla? She's approaching

752
00:39:01,726 --> 00:39:04,094
the tunnel entrance now;
she'll be with us in two minutes.

753
00:39:04,161 --> 00:39:05,896
Security is standing by.

754
00:39:05,963 --> 00:39:07,297
Good work, people.

755
00:39:11,002 --> 00:39:12,936
Dana...

756
00:39:13,004 --> 00:39:14,204
good work.

757
00:39:14,272 --> 00:39:15,272
Thank you, sir.

758
00:39:17,508 --> 00:39:20,043
If you'll excuse me
for a few minutes...

759
00:39:26,651 --> 00:39:30,253
Targets are heading
north on Orchard.

760
00:39:30,321 --> 00:39:31,988
Okay, they're getting
into an SUV, Jack.

761
00:39:32,056 --> 00:39:33,089
Do you copy? Yeah.

762
00:39:33,157 --> 00:39:34,391
Just stay with them, we'll follow.

763
00:39:34,458 --> 00:39:36,359
Owen, King, you're coming with us.

764
00:39:36,427 --> 00:39:39,195
You take King's vehicle,
you two double-back around Orchard.

765
00:39:39,263 --> 00:39:41,264
Chloe, I've got a shot here

766
00:39:41,332 --> 00:39:42,499
for facial recognition.

767
00:39:42,566 --> 00:39:44,768
Send it to me.

768
00:39:51,108 --> 00:39:53,276
It's Tarin Faroush.

769
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:55,679
He's supposed to be dead.

770
00:39:55,746 --> 00:39:58,348
Kayla said they shot him.

771
00:40:06,223 --> 00:40:09,059
You did the right thing, Tarin.

772
00:40:10,094 --> 00:40:12,062
I know.

773
00:40:12,129 --> 00:40:15,031
She will die for a good cause.

774
00:40:23,607 --> 00:40:24,641
Jack, Cole, come in.

775
00:40:24,709 --> 00:40:25,909
Go ahead, Chloe.

776
00:40:25,977 --> 00:40:27,043
We ID'd one of the targets.

777
00:40:27,111 --> 00:40:28,144
It's Tarin Faroush.

778
00:40:28,212 --> 00:40:29,179
Kayla said he sacrificed himself

779
00:40:29,246 --> 00:40:31,014
to save her, but he's still alive.

780
00:40:31,082 --> 00:40:33,249
Are you absolutely sure?

781
00:40:33,317 --> 00:40:34,250
Yes.

782
00:40:34,318 --> 00:40:35,919
What the hell's going on?

783
00:40:35,987 --> 00:40:37,787
The terrorists asked
us to give them a file

784
00:40:37,855 --> 00:40:38,855
they knew we would never give them.

785
00:40:38,923 --> 00:40:40,256
They never expected us to.

786
00:40:40,324 --> 00:40:41,558
Chloe, you got to
put Hastings on now.

787
00:40:41,625 --> 00:40:42,659
I'm on, Jack.

788
00:40:42,727 --> 00:40:44,260
You cannot let Kayla Hassan in.

789
00:40:44,328 --> 00:40:45,428
The terrorists faked her escape.

790
00:40:45,496 --> 00:40:46,863
They wanted to get her to CTU.

791
00:40:46,931 --> 00:40:47,864
For what purpose?

792
00:40:47,932 --> 00:40:48,865
What's the best way to disarm

793
00:40:48,933 --> 00:40:50,533
New York's radiological defenses?

794
00:40:50,851 --> 00:40:52,185
Taking out CTU.

795
00:40:52,253 --> 00:40:54,387
There's got to be something in the car,
some kind of a bomb.

796
00:40:54,455 --> 00:40:56,122
You need to stop her now.
Where is she?

797
00:40:57,191 --> 00:40:58,658
Oh, my God.

798
00:40:58,726 --> 00:41:00,493
She's in the tunnel.

799
00:41:00,561 --> 00:41:03,296
Security!

800
00:41:07,534 --> 00:41:09,135
Security!

801
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:13,072
Dana, with me!

802
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:14,974
Chloe, the car that Tarin got into,
where is it now?

803
00:41:15,042 --> 00:41:17,010
Crossing into Brooklyn,

804
00:41:17,077 --> 00:41:18,478
taking the first exit off
the Williamsburg Bridge.

805
00:41:18,545 --> 00:41:19,812
We cannot lose

806
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:22,015
that car, do you understand me?

807
00:41:22,082 --> 00:41:23,283
Copy.

808
00:41:24,418 --> 00:41:25,585
Stop the car!

809
00:41:25,653 --> 00:41:27,453
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

810
00:41:27,521 --> 00:41:29,289
Put your hands where
we can see them!

811
00:41:29,356 --> 00:41:32,258
Dana, call the bomb squad!

812
00:41:32,326 --> 00:41:34,193
Get out of the car!

813
00:41:34,261 --> 00:41:36,195
Take her.

814
00:41:36,263 --> 00:41:38,431
Bomb squad to the tunnel entrance.

815
00:41:40,834 --> 00:41:41,901
Get her away from here.

816
00:41:41,969 --> 00:41:43,002
Hastings, have you
stopped that car?

817
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:44,671
Not in time, Jack.
Hold on, just hold on.

818
00:41:47,408 --> 00:41:48,408
It's an EMP.

819
00:41:48,475 --> 00:41:50,276
It's an EMP!

820
00:41:50,344 --> 00:41:52,445
You need to shut down your
systems to protect the drones.

821
00:41:52,513 --> 00:41:53,646
There's no time, Jack.

822
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:58,251
Get away from the car!
I can move it.

823
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:01,487
Come on, get out of there!

824
00:42:02,389 --> 00:42:03,656
Get out of there!

825
00:42:11,999 --> 00:42:13,032
Chloe, can you hear me?

826
00:42:14,335 --> 00:42:15,535
Those drones right now are

827
00:42:15,602 --> 00:42:17,170
our only way of tracking
down those terrorists.

828
00:42:17,237 --> 00:42:19,205
You need to pass
them off to the NSA.

829
00:42:22,343 --> 00:42:23,343
Damn it, we're blind.

830
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:24,777
Chloe, did you cop... Chloe?!

831
00:42:24,845 --> 00:42:26,045
What the hell is happening?

832
00:42:26,113 --> 00:42:28,781
We need to contact NSA.

833
00:42:28,849 --> 00:42:30,783
The terrorists just took out CTU.
