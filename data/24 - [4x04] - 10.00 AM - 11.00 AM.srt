1
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,356
<i>In three hours, Heller will be tried</i>
<i>for war crimes against humanity. </i>

2
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,274
<i>If he is proven guilty, he will be executed</i>
<i>in accordance with our laws. </i>

3
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:25,399
When the trial begins,
you may have an opportunity to escape.

4
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:29,075
You have to take it, even if it's dangerous.

5
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:33,633
When Dad told me to take the briefcase
to Omar, Debbie followed me.

6
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,995
Debbie saw the warehouse
where we're holding Heller?

7
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:41,677
Yes. Father found out and he wants me to
get her over here. You know what that means.

8
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,435
- Debbie, thank you for coming.
- Sure.

9
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,110
I need you to build a firewall
around station four.

10
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,077
Who's that?
- Marianne.

11
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,720
I want to make sure
she doesn't stray from her area.

12
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,789
Fine.

13
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:58,829
Listen. The terrorists will try and execute
Heller in less than three hours.

14
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,956
- Bring him in.
- I don't think that's the right call.

15
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:04,828
I believe that they'll lead me
to Heller and the kidnappers.

16
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,639
Jack Bauer is no longer
cooperating with this investigation.

17
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:12,840
All departments need to work on the capture
of Jack Bauer and the hostile he's tracking.

18
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:18,519
Our first priority is to find these terrorists.
I'll need satellite surveillance to track them.

19
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,433
You want me to steal
satellite bandwidth from CTU.

20
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,670
Yes.

21
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:26,752
Will I have satellite coverage
in the next minute or two?

22
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,149
<i> It'll take at least five. </i>

23
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,994
I'm gonna have to figure out a way
to keep this guy here. Keep working on it.

24
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:36,231
Everybody put your hands up now!
You, don't move.

25
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,715
Slowly move back to the corner.

26
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,558
Everybody, just stay calm.

27
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,837
We'll be out of here before you know it.

28
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,558
You, hop up on the counter,
black out that camera.

29
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,278
Anybody else working in the back?
Put your hands up.

30
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,152
Move over there with the others. Now!

31
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,713
- <i> Do you have the IDs of the other two?</i>
- If I did, I'd tell you.

32
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,759
- <i> I'll keep you updated. </i>
Thank you, yeah. Please do.

33
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:47,630
Briefing in five minutes. County just reported
that Andrew Paige was taken into their ER.

34
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,518
Paige? The programmer
Jack went to pick up?

35
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:55,515
That's not all. The bodies of two unidentified
Middle Eastern men were found at the site.

36
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:59,036
- Gunshot wounds.
- Bauer must have done that to save the kid.

37
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,759
- Where did they find all this?
- Moorpark.

38
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,674
It's out of control. We lose an agent
and a witness has been disabled.

39
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,275
- What about the hostile and Bauer?
- Still at large.

40
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,558
Erin, we've less than three hours before
Heller's executed in front of the country.

41
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,916
Maybe we shouldn't concentrate on Bauer,
pursue other leads.

42
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,798
Except for Heller's son,
we have no other leads.

43
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:23,429
I want all tactical teams
working on finding Bauer and the hostile.

44
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,999
You got it.

45
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,709
Keep moving back towards the corner. Move!

46
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:31,076
- Everybody get down. Lady, get down.
Take it easy.

47
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:36,393
Shut up. You wanna get through this,
you listen to me. Get down on the floor now.

48
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,393
I want your wallets and your cellphones.
Make it quick.

49
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,431
- Where's yours?
- I don't have one.

50
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,193
Where's your cellphone?

51
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,599
- What's this? You some kind of cop?
- No.

52
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,514
- What do you need this for?
- Protection.

53
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:07,833
I get my money, no one gets hurt.
Do I make myself clear?

54
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,195
- You, in the cap, what's your name?
- Doug.

55
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:13,511
Doug, give me your keys.

56
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,233
Which one of these opens the front door?
Which one?

57
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,629
The brass one.

58
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:38,238
- There's an electrical problem. We're closed.
- I just need a pack of cigarettes.

59
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:44,634
I'm sorry, you're gonna have to go to
the gas station across the street. Thank you.

60
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,271
Is the satellite up yet?

61
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,716
No, I have to reposition
without Driscoll noticing. Where are you?

62
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,793
- I'm in a Mercury Mart. I staged a robbery.
- What?

63
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,316
It was the only way to stop him
getting back on the road. How long?

64
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,836
- It's gonna take ten minutes.
- Son of a bitch. Please hurry.

65
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:25,469
- I'll get back to you.
- Chloe, Driscoll's called a briefing.

66
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:29,553
- I'll be there in a couple minutes.
- Chloe. Now.

67
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,992
- Where are you going?
- To a briefing.

68
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,470
- Should I be in that?
- No.

69
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,154
- Hi, I'm Marianne. I'm helping out today.
- OK.

70
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,639
And you are?

71
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,109
This is Chloe O'Brian, our senior sys tech.

72
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,431
She doesn't have time to chat either,
Marianne.

73
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,875
It's nice to meet you, Chloe.

74
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:04,830
As some of you know, about an hour ago
a hostile abducted a witness, Andrew Paige.

75
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:09,277
- Do we know where this hostile is?
- No, but we have a general direction of travel.

76
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,751
County Emergency Services called this in.
His best route of escape is the freeway.

77
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,628
He'll likely dump his vehicle
and try to hijack another one.

78
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,473
This is Andrew Paige.

79
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:27,638
He was apparently tortured and about to be
killed when it seems Jack Bauer intervened.

80
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,154
If this took place in the last half-hour,

81
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,109
and the hostile continued east, he's
somewhere in northeast Ventura County.

82
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:39,318
We'll coordinate with Caltrans
and Ventura sheriffs to set up watch points.

83
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:43,279
I want every resource on this.
Edgar, lead satellite positioning.

84
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,512
Sarah, you'll coordinate with NSA.
That's all. Thank you.

85
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,108
Chloe.

86
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:57,035
I'm sorry about Andrew. They said
there's a good chance that he'll pull through.

87
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,270
Thanks.

88
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,399
And, Chloe,
there's nothing you could have done.

89
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,317
- I want you to put a pipe into Chloe's system.
- What for?

90
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,630
- She knew about Paige.
- How do you know?

91
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:20,350
Her reactions. Which means
she's been in touch with Jack Bauer.

92
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,159
Well, I'll need her access code.

93
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,037
Doug, get over here now!

94
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,470
Open the safe.

95
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:57,358
- That's it?
- Yeah. Why don't you take it and leave?

96
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,149
- I-I won't tell the police.
- When does the armoured truck come?

97
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,312
About 12:30. What, you want
to rob the armoured truck too?

98
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,312
Shut up. Get back in the corner. Move!

99
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,118
He's gonna keep us here another two hours?

100
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,753
We have to do something to stop him.

101
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,149
Dammit. Something is wrong.
Kalil is not answering his phone.

102
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,152
- Maybe he's out of range.
- No, not for this long.

103
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:39,519
Check with our people in the area.
Find out if anything has happened to him.

104
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:45,913
Kalil may not be here in time.
We'll have to boot up the routers without him.

105
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,831
Take care of it.

106
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,636
Let my daughter go. You don't need her.

107
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:59,309
- She has already been useful.
- Please. I'll do whatever you want.

108
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,597
I know you will.
That's why we are keeping her.

109
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:06,197
I don't care if you kill me,
but if you kill her,

110
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:10,432
even your own people
will see you as a barbaric pig.

111
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:19,073
- Is this what your religion teaches you?
- Dad, Dad, calm down.

112
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:24,033
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

113
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,235
Where's your medication?
Your nitroglycerine, where is it?

114
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,959
I left it in the car.

115
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,957
My father has a heart condition.
He needs his medication.

116
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,078
- Has Chloe been in contact with Bauer?
- No.

117
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,276
Keep watching.

118
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,314
- This is Edgar Stiles.
- Edgar, it's Chloe.

119
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:28,029
- Why you calling me?
- I need to talk to you. Meet me at Archives.

120
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,270
- When?
- Now.

121
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,438
- Why are we meeting like this?
- I need you to help me.

122
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,509
With what?

123
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,034
- I think Sarah piped into my system.
- Why?

124
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,475
Driscoll must have asked her to.

125
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:03,838
If Driscoll's spying on you, she must have
a reason. I'm not getting involved.

126
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,559
- I've been in contact with Jack Bauer.
- What?

127
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,076
- That's right. So either help me or turn me in.
- I'm turning you in.

128
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,278
- Jack can find Heller. Driscoll won't let him.
- That's her call.

129
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,351
- She's wrong.
- That's your opinion.

130
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,637
These decisions are not ours to make.

131
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,598
How about if you do it as a favour to me?

132
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:26,992
How many times have I helped you
since you started here? A lot.

133
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:31,278
What about the first two weeks when I did
all your work because you were nervous?

134
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,316
You owe me.

135
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:37,678
- This could get me fired.
- Not if I say I ordered you to do it.

136
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,150
Remember, I outrank you. I'd take the heat.

137
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,636
What do I have to do?

138
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,757
I need to reposition a satellite
and I need to do it now.

139
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:51,071
Since Sarah's piping my system
we have to use yours.

140
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,275
OK.

141
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:57,354
Send it to Archives Three.
I've transferred my calls there.

142
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:21,190
I want to know who's in charge here. I want
to speak to the man who was just in here.

143
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:24,238
- You'll speak to him later.
- No, now.

144
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:29,872
I am the Secretary of Defense of the United
States of America. You will listen to me.

145
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,315
- Dad, don't make it worse.
- What do you mean?

146
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:38,032
What can be worse than waiting here to be
murdered by these lawless, godless thugs?

147
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:42,750
- Dad, calm down.
- I don't want to. Don't tell me to calm down.

148
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:46,389
We're here, OK? The best we can do
is hope that someone comes and...

149
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,473
Hope? Hope that we get rescued? We have
to do something. We have to take...

150
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,873
Dad, what is it? What's happening?
Dad, just... OK, take a deep breath.

151
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,190
Help me. I think he's having a heart attack.

152
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:03,910
Dad, you've gotta lie down. Just lie down.
Dad, are you listening? It's OK. He's coming.

153
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,709
- Step back. Step away from him.
- We need to lie him down, please.

154
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:11,076
- Hurry, you've got to get him...
- Step away.

155
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,271
Go on. Get out of here.

156
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,629
- You still with me?
- Yeah.

157
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,870
Let's go.

158
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,028
Go back! Go back!

159
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,229
Put your weapon down. Slowly.

160
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,313
Both of you, hands on your head.

161
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:29,594
If another one of my men dies,
your daughter will be killed.

162
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,871
- How many men come with the truck?
- Two. One by the door. One takes the money.

163
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:49,988
- They park in the front or the back?
- In the front, by the street.

164
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:54,676
Come on, let's go. Everybody up,
we're moving to the back of the store. Now!

165
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,876
- Stand there.
- The longer you keep us...

166
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,110
Shut up. Let's go.

167
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,711
You try that again and I will kill you.
You understand me?

168
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,633
Get up. Now!

169
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,158
Move to the back of the store.

170
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:24,829
Dammit. Everybody in the freezer. Now.
Not you.

171
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:29,277
Move. Anybody makes a sound,
I kill all of you.

172
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,353
Doug, you in there?
- Make him go away.

173
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,355
Sorry, I didn't hear you. I was in the back.

174
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,273
- How come you're closed?
- I'm taking inventory.

175
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,590
In the middle of the day?

176
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,550
Yeah.

177
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,915
OK, then.

178
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,675
- You're sure everything's all right?
- Yeah, fine.

179
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:15,797
- You don't look fine, Doug.
- I'm just a little tired.

180
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,030
- Thanks.
- You mind if I use the head?

181
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,634
It's broken.

182
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:25,077
Something's wrong. Are you gonna
tell me, or do I have to see for myself?

183
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,879
Don't even think about it. Step inside now.

184
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,394
Move. Grab the counter.

185
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,997
Doug, lock the door.

186
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,389
Give me your keys.

187
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,995
Go over there
and get me his gun and his radio.

188
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,155
Move. Come on.

189
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,358
Take out his cuffs.

190
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,752
Officer, put your hands behind your back.
Cuff him.

191
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,997
Go back to the freezer. Let's go.

192
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,350
<i>At this time we have no more information</i>

193
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:37,671
<i>regarding the kidnapping</i>
<i>of Secretary of Defense Heller</i>

194
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:41,878
<i>and his daughter, Audrey,</i>
<i>other than the image you are now seeing... </i>

195
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:45,669
My husband and I realise
we've been unfair to you.

196
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:51,995
We've treated you as badly as we have been
treated ourselves by certain ignorant people.

197
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,832
Well...

198
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:58,630
it was pretty obvious
you didn't approve of us going out.

199
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,712
- Is that OK to say?
- Yeah, it's OK.

200
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:09,749
- Well, we hope you'll accept our apology.
- That means a lot to me.

201
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,276
That said, there is something else
I want to discuss with you.

202
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,874
What's that?

203
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:20,158
This morning you followed Behrooz
to his father's warehouse.

204
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,549
Oh.

205
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,790
Um...

206
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,758
I thought Behrooz was seeing someone else.

207
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,116
- I got jealous.
- Oh, I understand,

208
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:36,797
but Mr Araz moved his inventory there
because he's been robbed a few times

209
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:42,116
and we've been trying to keep
that place secret so it doesn't happen again.

210
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:47,638
- I promise I won't tell anyone where it is.
- Good. And you haven't told anyone yet?

211
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:51,554
No. I haven't talked to anyone
but Behrooz today.

212
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:54,108
Well, then, that's settled.

213
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:58,796
- Thank you for inviting me here, Mrs Araz.
- It's my pleasure.

214
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,156
Has Behrooz ever shown you pictures
from when he was a child?

215
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,037
No.

216
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:11,196
Show her, Behrooz. Have a look at these.

217
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,510
I'll be right back.

218
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,360
Oh, my God.

219
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,353
- That's not you.
- It is.

220
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,955
You were so cute.

221
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,595
- Thank you, Hana.
- You're welcome.

222
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:45,549
- Have you been following this, Mr Araz?
- <i> Secretary of Defense James Heller... </i>

223
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,039
Yes. It's horrible.

224
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:51,272
It makes it so difficult when people
from home do these unspeakable things.

225
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,271
I agree.

226
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,675
- Yes.
- The girl didn't tell anyone.

227
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,398
- <i>Are you sure?</i>
- Yes.

228
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,552
- Good. It'll be taken care of, then?
- Soon.

229
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:12,479
Have Behrooz do it. He created this problem,
he should solve it himself.

230
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:16,838
- I agree. I'll call you when it's done.
- Thank you.

231
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:24,435
<i> Two Charles Nine, there's a 211 in</i>
<i>progress at 2221 Mill Road, cross street Cedar. </i>

232
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:29,719
<i>Two males seen leaving the bank</i>
<i>with shotguns. Respond code three. </i>

233
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:33,233
<i>Two Charles Nine, do you copy?</i>

234
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,919
Stand back from the door!

235
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,556
- Step back.
- <i> Do you copy?</i>

236
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,679
- You. Are you unit nine?
- Yeah.

237
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:50,392
You tell them you're on your way.
One wrong word and I will kill you. Now.

238
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,358
- Two Charles Nine...
- Help! We're being robbed!

239
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:59,910
- <i> We have help on the way. </i>
- Get up. Now!

240
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,390
- Now would be the time to let us go.
- Shut up.

241
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:11,788
These people are your responsibility.
You better start talking to them.

242
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,278
Sarah.

243
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,158
- Has Chloe had any contact with Bauer yet?
- No.

244
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,153
- Could her work be on his behalf?
- No. I've been watching her system.

245
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,470
Chloe is not stupid.

246
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:47,632
Assume she's taken measures
to protect herself.

247
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,553
Maybe she's coopted the help
of someone else inside.

248
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,269
I'm not quite sure how much of my time
you want me to devote to this.

249
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:57,670
I expect you to be able to walk
and chew gum at the same time.

250
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:01,196
Chloe's loyal to Bauer.
There's a good chance she's helping him.

251
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,589
Find out how.

252
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:14,359
What are you doing?
That looks like a satellite.

253
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:17,238
- It was. I mean it is.
- A satellite for what?

254
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:20,039
- We're trying to find Bauer.
- Division's doing that.

255
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,839
I'm just going over it.
Sometimes they miss data.

256
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:26,549
- Do they know that you're doing that?
- Yeah, they know what I'm doing.

257
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,712
Here, call them if you don't believe me.

258
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:33,791
Relax. I don't have to call anybody.
Do what you have to do.

259
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,996
I will.

260
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:44,628
Do me a favour. There's a chance
that Jack might try to contact Chloe.

261
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:49,669
- If you see or hear anything, call me, OK?
- Why would Jack try to contact Chloe?

262
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,479
- He just might. Let me know.
- Sure.

263
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:08,518
- Edgar Stiles.
- <i> Edgar, what did she want?</i>

264
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,955
She wants to nail you to the wall.

265
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:14,476
Remember our deal. If you get caught,
you don't take me with you.

266
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,472
And if I get caught,
you say you ordered me to do this.

267
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:21,792
You don't have to repeat the deal.
Did you reposition the satellite?

268
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,872
I'm working on it. Leave me alone.

269
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:32,595
No. We'll use our own people for that.

270
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:36,912
- Hang on, Ed. Yes, what is it?
- <i> Your daughter's on line two. </i>

271
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:42,028
- I'm busy. Tell her I'll call her back.
- <i> She says it's important. </i>

272
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:46,318
Fine. Ed, I'm gonna
have to get back to you. OK, bye.

273
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,390
- Maya?
- I need you to come home.

274
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,119
- <i> What's wrong?</i>
- I'm having a bad day.

275
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:57,193
- Have you been taking your medication?
- No.

276
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,794
If you don't take it you're going to feel bad.

277
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:02,713
It numbs me. I don't like it.

278
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,678
- Do you like feeling like this better?
- Come home.

279
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,955
- I can't, Maya.
- Why not?

280
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:11,919
Listen. I want you to take the pills
and I'll call you back as soon as I can.

281
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,834
- You promise?
- Of course. What are you gonna do?

282
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:19,356
- I'll take my pills.
- Good.

283
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,351
- Do you love me?
- You know I do.

284
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,749
Then why don't you say it?

285
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,195
I love you, Maya, OK?

286
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,589
- I do.
- OK.

287
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,989
All right. Bye.

288
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,837
Behrooz, can I see you for a moment?

289
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,838
Yes.

290
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,070
I'll be right back.

291
00:24:56,440 --> 00:25:02,436
I talked to your father. We both agree you
have to be the one who'll take care of this.

292
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:08,757
- She didn't tell anyone.
- We're fortunate that's the case,

293
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,990
but she still saw the warehouse,

294
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:17,394
and she could tell the authorities about it
if she's ever brought in for questioning.

295
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:23,159
This is riskier than letting her live. If she
disappears, her mother will call the police.

296
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:28,519
By the time this day is over, the police
will be too busy to look for a runaway girl.

297
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,194
Now, take it.

298
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:38,116
Don't make me bring your father into this.
Just take her to the basement and do it.

299
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,316
Don't think about it.

300
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,709
Get it over with.

301
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,960
- Behrooz?
- Hey.

302
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,474
- Everything OK?
- Yeah.

303
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:29,269
I want to make a copy of this one.
Can I take it home and scan it?

304
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,157
Sure.

305
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:42,755
- We need to get out of here. You're in danger.
- From who?

306
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:47,118
- Don't ask questions, just come with me.
- What? Behrooz?

307
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,270
Trust me, Debbie.

308
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,399
- We're OK. Come on.
- I can't.

309
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,517
- Why not? What's wrong?
- I don't know.

310
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:04,276
Answer me, Debbie. What's wrong?
Come on, Debbie. What's wrong?

311
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:08,114
- Get up, Debbie. We need to go. Come on.
Please help me.

312
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:12,113
What's wrong? Debbie, come on.

313
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:15,351
Debbie, what's wrong?

314
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:23,152
- What did you do to her?
- I didn't expect you to be able to do it.

315
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,756
Debbie. Debbie.

316
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:30,757
Come on, Debbie. Debbie!

317
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:44,188
Give me the gun.

318
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,188
Give me the gun.

319
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,316
Hey!

320
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:09,436
I am so disappointed in you.

321
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,795
Yeah?

322
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,633
<i>This is Sergeant McGrath. You're surrounded. </i>

323
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:58,075
You should know that I've got hostages.

324
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:01,232
I will kill them if you use tear gas
and send your men in.

325
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:04,392
Let's not go there yet, OK?
Who do you have in there?

326
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,153
The owner, two men and a woman.

327
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,913
- What about Officer Dotson?
- Yeah, I got him too.

328
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,913
<i>You only need one hostage. </i>
<i>Keep Officer Dotson and let the others go. </i>

329
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,560
I need to think about that.

330
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:39,551
<i> Yeah?</i>

331
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:42,108
- I've got satellite coverage.
- OK, good.

332
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:46,034
The suspect will be free in five minutes.
He'll be on foot on Route 11.

333
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,838
I'll find him.

334
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,555
One of you is coming with me.

335
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,036
You.

336
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,835
Come here.

337
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:24,276
Put your hands up against the rack. Now!

338
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:29,912
Everybody else,
to the back of the cooler. Move!

339
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,711
Open the door.

340
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:45,759
Lock the door with the chain.

341
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,957
Now, I will let you go as soon as we are clear.

342
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,713
If you try and be a hero, I'll kill you.
Understand?

343
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:55,634
- I understand.
- Good. Let's go.

344
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,792
- Which car is yours?
- The blue Lexus.

345
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,479
Unlock the door.

346
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,872
Move.

347
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:11,430
Tell those officers
to put their weapons down and step back.

348
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,670
OK. We'll try and help you through this.

349
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:18,709
- Tell them to do it now!
- OK, drop your weapons and move back.

350
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:30,155
Stand back!
- <i> Do it. Step back. </i>

351
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,398
Get into the car.

352
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,710
Open the door.

353
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,314
Come on, open the driver's door.

354
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:43,150
If you try and follow me, I will shoot him.

355
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:48,194
On my count, get in.
One, two, three. Move.

356
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,111
Go! Go!

357
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,949
Call in a roadblock. Suspect driving
east on Route 11. One hostage.

358
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:22,116
Move the rear-view mirror to the right
so I can see out the back.

359
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,118
There.

360
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:30,675
- When do you let me go?
- When I feel like it.

361
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,473
- Who are you?
- What do you mean?

362
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:38,154
You don't seem like
you need to rob a Mercury Mart.

363
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:43,394
That Mercury Mart was a money drop. There
was supposed to be 18 grand in that safe.

364
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:46,631
How did you know that?

365
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:50,349
We're done sharing. I'll not forget
your face and I've got your licence.

366
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:55,514
You talk to the police, it's not gonna be
hard to find you. Do you understand me?

367
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,592
I won't tell them a thing.

368
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:01,194
OK, pull over here.

369
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,911
Now!

370
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:12,839
Get out of the car. Move!

371
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,834
Start running. Now!

372
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:40,599
O'Brian.

373
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,352
- <i>You got him?</i>
- Yeah.

374
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:45,034
Download his position to my PDA.
Stay reachable.

375
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,678
I will.

376
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:15,516
I'm sorry, could you repeat that?
Hold on a second.

377
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,636
- Ms Driscoll.
- Yes, Sarah?

378
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:22,999
You have a phone call from your neighbour.
A George Kliavkoff. It's about your daughter.

379
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:25,036
- What line?
- Six.

380
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,113
It's Erin.

381
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:31,875
- There's been another incident with Maya.
- What's happened?

382
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:35,635
She came into the back yard
and started screaming at Evan again.

383
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:39,190
- Is Evan OK?
- Yes. Fortunately I was home.

384
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,639
But this is the end. I've got to protect my boy.

385
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:46,712
- Did you call the police?
- Yes. They're on their way.

386
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,872
- Where's Maya now?
- <i>She went back to your house. </i>

387
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:54,511
- I'm very sorry. This will not happen again.
- It can't, Erin.

388
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:01,675
Ms Driscoll? Is everything all right?

389
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,035
No, it's not.

390
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:07,510
- Is there anything I can do to help?
- Yes.

391
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:17,433
Call LAPD Westside and find out
who they dispatched to pick up my daughter.

392
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,671
She has a condition.
She suffers from schizophrenia.

393
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:24,469
There was an incident
with one of my neighbours.

394
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,555
What would you like me to do?

395
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:30,712
Tell the officers to cancel the call.
I'll take care of it.

396
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:34,349
Yeah, I don't think that's possible.
They have to follow through.

397
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:39,036
- CTU has pre-emptive privilege over local.
- Only in a national security situation.

398
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:42,874
Sarah, I'm asking you to do something.

399
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,474
Should I ask someone else?

400
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,391
No.

401
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,789
I'll do it.

402
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:54,158
Send a unit over to my house.
One medic, one field agent.

403
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,629
- Bring Maya back to our clinic.
- Yes, ma'am.

404
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,711
Thank you.

405
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,997
Yeah, I got it. Thanks.

406
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,509
I found Jack Bauer.

407
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,720
- Where is he?
- Somis. He's tracking the hostile.

408
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,394
- Now he's using satellite.
- How do you know that?

409
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:18,358
DOD complained that someone
was stealing bandwidth.

410
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:20,590
I took a look at the imagery and found him.

411
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:24,229
All right. Bring them both in.
Who logged on to that satellite?

412
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,435
Chloe.

413
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:30,389
Chloe, why are you logged on
to an active DOD satellite?

414
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:35,715
- All right, you're done here.
- Whatever. I was gonna quit anyway.

415
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:38,997
You're not fired, you're arrested. Call security.

416
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:42,595
Edgar, lock up her systems
and take control of all her files.

417
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:45,990
- Yes, ma'am.
- I want you to call Jack Bauer now.

418
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,351
- Yeah?
- <i>Driscoll wants to talk. </i>

419
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,431
- What?
- Hello, Jack.

420
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:06,036
Erin. Look, I've got some information for you.
The hostile's name is Kalil Hasan.

421
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:08,236
Stand down. It's over.

422
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,278
Erin, Hasan is free.
He's looking for a car and a phone.

423
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:14,909
Once he has those things
he'll lead us straight to Heller.

424
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,037
- You can't be sure.
- You've got him on satellite.

425
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:20,315
Bombard the area with a receptor beacon.

426
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,630
Send a team to pick up the hostile.

427
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,792
If you do that,
everything I've done will mean nothing.

428
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:29,759
- I'm glad you finally figured that out.
- Erin.

429
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:34,758
- Take Ms O'Brian into holding.
- Ma'am.

430
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,278
Edgar, you have it up on satellite?

431
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,952
Yeah.

432
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,717
The hostile's flagging down a car.

433
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:50,511
Need some help?
- Yeah, I just, uh...

434
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,840
Curtis, give me the feed down here.

435
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:24,038
- Sarah, what's the load on the cell tower?
- About 40 to 50 calls.

436
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:29,148
Put personnel on every call.
Let's see if he contacts someone.

437
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,956
- <i>Yes?</i>
- Omar, it's me.

438
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:42,511
- Where have you been? We've been worried.
- Everything's fine. I'll explain later.

439
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:45,068
- <i>Where are you?</i>
- I'll be there within the hour.

440
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,715
- Is the broadcast on schedule?
- Yes.

441
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:51,270
We're about to prepare Heller. Hurry.

442
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,199
- Edgar.
- Not now.

443
00:38:56,280 --> 00:39:01,070
Yes, now. How do you feel
about what's happening to Chloe?

444
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,473
- What do you mean?
- She'll not just lose her job.

445
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:08,836
- She might go to prison.
- Why do you care about all this?

I overheard the conversation you had earlier.
I know you were working with her.

447
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:18,794
- What do you want?
- I want your attention whenever I need it.

448
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:24,550
Thanks, Robin. Ms Driscoll, we got the call.

449
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,034
Put it on speaker.

450
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:30,918
Cue it from the top of the call.

451
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,349
<i>Omar, it's me. </i>

452
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:37,911
- <i>Where have you been? We've been worried. </i>
- <i>Everything's fine. I'll explain later. </i>

453
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,753
- <i>Where are you?</i>
- <i>I'll be there within the hour. </i>

454
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:43,035
- <i>Is the broadcast on schedule?</i>
- <i>Yes. </i>

455
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:46,430
<i>We're about to prepare Heller. Hurry. </i>

456
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:49,671
Looks like Jack was right.

457
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:56,836
Tell the teams to stand down for the time
being. We'll keep tracking Hasan by satellite.

458
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,556
Son of a bitch.

459
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:50,517
- Dammit.
- Get out of the car.

460
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:54,388
Get out of the car
and put your hands in the air.

461
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:04,917
Step out of the vehicle now.
Come on. Come on.

462
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,912
- Get out of the car now.
Get your hands up

463
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,070
and step out of the vehicle.

464
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:18,229
- <i> Suspect is armed. </i>
Step away from the car.

465
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:21,153
Down! On your knees.

466
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:26,598
Put your palms down.
Put your chest flat on the ground.

467
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:31,393
Keep your hands down, all the way down.

468
