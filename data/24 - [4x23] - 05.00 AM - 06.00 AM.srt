1
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,040
I've been told a cruise missile was launched
containing a nuclear warhead.

2
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,235
<i> That's correct. </i>

3
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,311
What about Marwan? You think he'll break?

4
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:27,030
That won't be easy, sir. He's planned and
organised everything that's happened today.

5
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,876
How do I fight terrorists
while provoking a nuclear superpower?

6
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,757
We marched on Chinese soil,

7
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,992
we kidnapped one of their nationals, and
in the process the Chinese consul was killed.

8
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:42,154
The murder of our consul on Chinese soil
could be construed as an act of war.

9
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,233
I assume you know this man.
Howard Bern, one of your field agents.

10
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,754
Camera at the consulate picked up your face.

11
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,355
- I was wearing my mask.
- Trust me, I saw the freeze-frame. It was you.

12
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,475
I'm sorry, Jack.

13
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,710
You gotta go.
There's a chopper waiting for you.

14
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,509
It doesn't matter where you take me.
What I want is already happening.

15
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,673
Go!

16
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,752
Notify the perimeter
we no longer have Marwan in custody.

17
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,553
Richard Heller called Marwan a week ago.
They're bringing him to CTU.

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,275
This is a sketch of the guy
Richard Heller described.

19
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,874
He and the girl are our only leads
to finding Marwan.

20
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,678
One of us is gonna get caught
to save the other?

21
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,990
It's gonna be you.

22
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,308
Tony, wait.

23
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,470
I can't spend another day without you.

24
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,358
I'm ready to leave here.
I'm ready to go with you.

25
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,109
Be careful.

26
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,075
<i>Tony, this is Jack. </i>

27
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,958
- <i>Has anybody reported outside movement?</i>
- No. Why?

28
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,508
The man is dead.
The girl is no longer in the apartment.

29
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,712
<i>Tony, do you copy?</i>

30
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,393
<i>Tony, do you copy?</i>

31
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,471
Castle, why is Almeida not on com?

32
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:52,789
All teams, this is Bauer. Castle is down.
Almeida is missing and possibly a hostage.

33
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,149
- <i> Have you apprehended her?</i>
- No, we do not have her in custody.

34
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,435
She's hiding here in the apartment complex.

35
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,796
She killed Castle and I believe
she's taken Almeida as a hostage.

36
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,519
- Is there any way she slipped the perimeter?
- No.

37
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,876
There's over 600 apartments.
We have to search them room by room.

38
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:18,555
- Listen, we need more personnel here.
- We're running low on manpower.

39
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,393
There's a missile in the air
carrying a nuclear warhead.

40
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,074
This is our best shot at taking it out
before it hits.

41
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,755
The White House is searching for the missile.
We're stretched thin.

42
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,436
We'll have LAPD send more men. We'll send
Curtis and another tac team to the location.

43
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:36,559
OK. We've initiated a search starting with
the buildings nearest the perimeter,

44
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,279
working our way in,
but we need LAPD here now.

45
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,510
Keep us posted. Contact Division.

46
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,956
See if they can spare more men.
I'll call our liaison at LAPD.

47
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,434
We've almost completed our satellite pass
over the radius of the missile.

48
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,159
- And no sign of it yet?
- No, not so far.

49
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,078
What do you think our chances are of locating
the missile with subsequent passes?

50
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,833
They're not very good.
This missile's an S-class.

51
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,708
It uses elements of Stealth technology.
It was designed to evade detection.

52
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,109
I know, but it will still have a heat signature.

53
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:10,273
Yes, but the lower the missile flies
to the ground, the harder it is to pick up.

54
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,079
How much longer
until you've completed the pass?

55
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,878
Uh, less than 20 minutes.

56
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:18,236
- Get back to me when you have the results.
- All right.

57
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:21,710
- We need every agent there.
- <i> They're not cleared for field work. </i>

58
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:26,749
Bump up their security level on a provisional
basis. Call me back with the exact number.

59
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,628
All right. Coordinate that with Edgar Stiles
here at com. Thanks, Rick.

60
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,757
- What did LAPD say?
- They're keeping units in reserve...

61
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,516
- They're sending more patrolmen to Jack?
- They're sending nine over there now and...

62
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,955
Nine? That's not nearly enough.

63
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,157
- We'll have to reassign our people there.
- I'm taking care of that.

64
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:47,357
When? We need people there now.
This woman has to be captured.

65
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,192
Michelle.

66
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,750
Everyone understands what's at stake here.

67
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:56,549
We're gonna do our best to find this woman,
but we have to remain calm,

68
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,950
or everything will spiral out of control.

69
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,870
You're right. I'm not being objective.

70
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:08,350
I'll admit it. I'm worried about
what this woman might do to Tony,

71
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,874
but I will not lose sight of the big picture.

72
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:15,556
The big picture is that
we have to apprehend this hostile alive.

73
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,076
Nothing else matters.

74
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,029
- What is it, Marwan?
- You're late. You were supposed to check in.

75
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,588
I know. There was a hitch.

76
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:52,639
- <i>Nothing serious. Um, I am gonna be there. </i>
- What kind of hitch?

77
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,508
There was a problem in the apartment
and I'm dealing with it.

78
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,273
I'm leaving in one hour.
I'm not waiting for you.

79
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,669
<i>I know, and I'm gonna be there. </i>

80
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,395
Well, we don't have much time.

81
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:30,838
They're very close to finding us and that
would be very, very bad for both of us.

82
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:36,358
So tell me. Two years ago you put Michelle
Dessler's life ahead of national security.

83
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,637
You let a suspect escape
and you committed treason.

84
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:43,110
Is she gonna do the same for you?

85
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,037
- <i>Mike, it's Audrey Raines. </i>
- Yes, Audrey. What have you got?

86
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,910
The satellite pass is complete. We could not
detect the missile with thermal imaging.

87
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,356
<i>There's just too much radiant heat</i>
<i>from ground sources. </i>

88
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,635
Ms Raines, this is President Palmer.

89
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:03,156
Is there a chance another satellite pass
will find the missile?

90
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,038
Well, the more data we have,
Mr President, the better,

91
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,590
but a more intensive pass
will take two to three hours.

92
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,036
And we expect the missile
to find its target before then.

93
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,872
Yes, sir, we do.

94
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:20,989
All right. Make sure FBI's on a real-time link
with all local emergency channels.

95
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,116
I'll get that done right now.

96
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:27,034
I also want you to compile disaster scenarios
for the urban centres

97
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,395
within range of the missile.

98
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,672
Sir, that's 20 of the largest cities
in this country.

99
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,557
I'm aware of that. I want death rates,

100
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:40,235
fallout patterns, emergency response
predictions for all of them.

101
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:44,438
- Yes, sir. I'll take care of that right now.
- Thank you, Ms Raines.

102
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:49,196
Assign teams sections of the grid. We do not
want people bumping into each other.

103
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,589
If the subject is spotted, what's the protocol?

104
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,877
We maximise for capture.
There can be no lag time.

105
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,793
You wanna evaluate the formation?
She's got Tony hostage.

106
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,916
We proceed as if there is no hostage.

107
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,231
There is only one operational objective -
to capture this woman.

108
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:07,074
Make sure that's the profile you send out
to all the teams. Understand?

109
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,230
Yes.

110
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,153
Dessler.

111
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,755
Why don't you go somewhere private
so we can talk?

112
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,150
- Who is this?
- I'm sending you the answer.

113
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,675
Tony.

114
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,035
<i>Now do you know who this is?</i>

115
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,232
And don't bother trying to triangulate the call.

116
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:49,552
- It's scrambled.
- Please, don't hurt him.

117
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:54,953
He's OK for now, but he won't be
unless you do everything that I say, Michelle.

118
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:59,113
- I understand.
- I need your help getting outta here.

119
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,952
- Wh-what kind of help?
- You're hesitating.

120
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:06,828
I'm not. I'm not.
I just need to know what you want me to do.

121
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,956
Your men are between me and my exit.

122
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:12,919
I need to know what their search patterns are
and how many men there are.

123
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,151
- OK. OK. I'll find out.
- You'll tell me right now.

124
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,949
- I have to talk to my tactical teams.
- Oh, Michelle, you're stalling.

125
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,474
How many men are there, total?

126
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,190
Upwards of 30, not including LAPD,
and reinforcements are on the way.

127
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:32,877
You will need to remove your men
from the northeast driveway of the complex.

128
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,996
I- I don't know if I can do that.

129
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:38,117
You will redeploy your men
by the time I call you back,

130
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,760
or Tony dies.

131
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,830
- When are you calling back?
- <i>Soon. Get moving, Michelle. </i>

132
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,836
Oh, she still loves you.

133
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,195
The question is how much.

134
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,992
- <i>Edgar Stiles. </i>
- Send the deployment group to my screen.

135
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:21,358
- It's updating. You want the last version?
- <i> Just send it. </i>

136
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,440
- Are reinforcements there?
- <i>Some are on site now. </i>

137
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:37,550
Some will be there in 15 minutes. You want
me to send the upgraded grid when it's in?

138
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,878
Ms Dessler?

139
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,870
Yes.

140
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,235
Yes, do that.

141
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,676
No. No, we can't eliminate the Midwest or
any region within the missile's flying range.

142
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,990
<i> All areas of the country are vulnerable?</i>

143
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:10,675
Yes, that's what I'm trying to tell you.
This warhead could hit anywhere.

144
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:14,719
We're putting together the projected
casualty numbers. They're gonna be high.

145
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,711
Yeah.

146
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,512
- Where are we on the apartments search?
- Nothing so far.

147
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,273
- LAPD there yet?
- They're on their way.

148
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,513
I'll be at com.

149
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,830
I can't do this.

150
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,076
Can't do what?

151
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:38,113
I can't sacrifice the lives of all those people
if this warhead goes off.

152
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:43,191
- She called me.
- Who? Who called you?

153
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,714
The hostile who has Tony.

154
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,155
- When? What did she say?
- A couple of minutes ago.

155
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,028
She said to redeploy our men
so she can get away...

156
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,714
or Tony dies.

157
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,794
- <i> Yes, sir?</i>
- Patch me through to Jack Bauer.

158
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:17,071
Take your team.
Start working the second floor, building 11.

159
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,116
- <i> Jack, you read me?</i>
- I copy.

160
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,919
We've got something.
The suspect contacted Michelle.

161
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,560
She confirms she's holding Tony hostage.

162
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,428
She's trying to use him as leverage against
Michelle to open an escape route.

163
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,988
- Is Michelle there?
- I'm right here, Jack.

164
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,196
Do we have any idea where she is?

165
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:37,398
She wants me to clear the northeast driveway.
She's going to call to confirm I did it.

166
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,675
- When?
- I don't know. It could be any second.

167
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,355
I want you to make her believe
that you're still cooperating with her.

168
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,476
I need you to draw her into the open.

169
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:49,155
I promise you that we will do
everything we can for Tony.

170
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,150
OK.

171
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,117
<i>Stay ready for her call. </i>

172
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:56,557
I'll pull all our units out of the northeast
driveway, put them in concealed positions.

173
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:00,155
She might change her mind at the last minute
and try another escape route.

174
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,028
We'll be ready for that, but I want her
to believe Michelle's complying.

175
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:08,671
Once she's 50 yards outside of the complex
and can't re-enter, our teams will converge.

176
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:12,753
- Let me know when your men can redeploy.
- Copy that.

177
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,478
- Are you gonna be all right?
- Yeah.

178
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:26,789
- I was gonna do what she wanted.
- Michelle.

179
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:32,830
I didn't call you right away. All I could
think of at first was saving Tony's life.

180
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,433
It's OK. It's done.

181
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:52,393
Los Angeles Police Department.
Open up!

182
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,550
Yes, sir.

183
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:59,111
All designated teams, prepare to move into
secondary positions on my command. Curtis.

184
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,033
- What should I do?
- Some residents aren't cooperating.

185
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:05,192
Have LAPD units arrest anybody
that's giving us a problem.

186
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,999
Why don't we pull some of the resources
off the search?

187
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,640
We'd have a better chance
of finding the hostile.

188
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,871
The hostile will look for any sign
that Michelle's betrayed her.

189
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:17,077
We have to act as if we have
no idea they've been in contact.

190
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,993
- Understood.
- Once you're done with LAPD, I need you.

191
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,433
You got it.

192
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,670
- Bill, this is Jack. Do you copy?
- Yeah.

193
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,957
We're ready to go here.
Any new communication from the hostile?

194
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:31,352
No, Michelle's still waiting for her call.
Have you been able to make any ID on scene?

195
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,398
Forensics tried to pull prints,
but came up with nothing.

196
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,233
Same result here.
No match on the voiceprint.

197
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,788
She's managed to stay completely
out of the radar.

198
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:44,351
We're gonna have to hope she slips up and
makes a mistake, otherwise we're in trouble.

199
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,477
- Proceed when ready. We're standing by.
- <i>Copy that. </i>

200
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:51,269
All northeast driveway teams,
move into secondary positions. We're a go.

201
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,231
- Hi. What are you doing here?
- Hey.

202
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,108
You're supposed to stay in your apartment.
There's some crazy person loose.

203
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:40,512
- Yeah, I know. I know. Hey, where's Joss?
- He just got up.

204
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,717
Can you just get him?
I need to talk to him. Something happened.

205
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,835
Joss!

206
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,718
- What's going on?
- Nothing, just weird stuff.

207
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,074
- What?
- Nothing.

208
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:52,789
- Why don't you just tell me?
- No, it's cool.

209
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,156
- Hey, what's going on?
- Hey, man, how are you?

210
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,554
Not a sound.

211
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:31,272
I just got off a very disturbing phone call
from the Chinese foreign secretary.

212
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,590
They're pressing us on the consulate attack?

213
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,069
It's much worse than that, David.

214
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,391
The fallout from that attack
you authorised is escalating.

215
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:42,119
They're determined to pin this on us.

216
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:47,149
If they confirm this is one of our men, I don't
have to tell you how disastrous it would be.

217
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,071
No, sir, you don't.

218
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:53,836
This is not conclusive enough for the Chinese
to turn this into an international incident.

219
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,879
- If they find corroborating evidence?
- CTU is preventing that from happening,

220
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:02,670
including getting this agent out of sight
until it blows over.

221
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,908
I gave you the authority to make the decision,

222
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,276
but you never should have
ordered that assault.

223
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:12,955
If we hadn't carried out the raid,
we'd be nowhere in stopping the missile.

224
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,076
And where are we, David?

225
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,833
Is there some progress I don't know about?

226
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:21,230
CTU is closing in
on one of Marwan's associates.

227
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:24,710
If they apprehend her in time, they feel
they can use her to find Marwan.

228
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:28,839
Do you know how speculative that sounds?
My God, we're never gonna find it in time!

229
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,751
Don't say that!

230
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:37,077
We will. You must believe that
if you're going to lead today.

231
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:40,357
How? Every second brings that missile
closer to its target,

232
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,159
which, for all we know, is us.

233
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,913
We are not sitting on our hands, Mr President.

234
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,549
We are using every resource at our disposal
to find this missile.

235
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:52,359
We will prevent the warhead from going off.

236
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,278
I wish I was as confident as you are.

237
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,877
You need to be.

238
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,349
Remain presidential.

239
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:09,037
Demand nothing less than success
from your people and you will get it.

240
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,033
All right.

241
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,197
All right.

242
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:21,348
- What do I tell the Chinese foreign secretary?
- You don't.

243
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:26,070
Let Mike handle this. He'll tell them
unless they have proof of our involvement,

244
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,118
you don't wanna hear from them today.

245
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:38,790
- <i> Mr Buchanan, Agent Bern on six. </i>
- Send it to my cellphone.

246
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,996
<i>Yes, sir. </i>

247
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,755
Buchanan.

248
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,150
It's Agent Bern, sir. I got a message
to call you as soon as I landed.

249
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:55,756
- Are we on a secure line?
- Yes, sir, it's an encrypted cell.

250
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:00,436
The Chinese are pressing the case that we're
involved in the assault on their consulate.

251
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,875
Have they found evidence
beyond the video of me?

252
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,110
No, and we have to make sure they don't.

253
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,556
I want you to start fabricating an alibi
with CTU in San Diego.

254
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,313
Make it look like you worked there
during the assault.

255
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,915
Our transport's arriving right now, sir.
I'll get right on it.

256
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,560
The alibi has to withstand careful scrutiny.

257
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:21,792
San Diego phone logs, rosters
and mainframe records all have to back it up.

258
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,792
- It'll be airtight, sir.
- It has to be.

259
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:31,068
Sir, about my family, do you think there's any
chance the Chinese will try to get to them?

260
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:35,950
They can't. We've already contacted your wife
and we've moved her and your kids to a hotel.

261
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:39,350
- <i>I'll be in touch, Agent Bern. </i>
- Thank you very much, sir.

262
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,235
Drive.

263
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:00,877
- What the hell is this?
- I think you already know what this is.

264
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,635
CTU sent a team into our consulate
just a few hours ago.

265
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,793
You were on the team
and our consul general was killed.

266
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,913
You're gonna tell me who was responsible.

267
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,833
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Really?

268
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:20,631
Then why were you being transported here
by helicopter from CTU Los Angeles?

269
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,234
- You don't know where I came from.
- Actually, I do.

270
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:28,599
Before entering CTU earlier tonight,
we turned our satellite on that location.

271
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,796
While I was questioning your superiors,

272
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,395
our satellite picked up someone
being taken away by helicopter.

273
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,914
So what? That wasn't me.

274
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,195
No, it was you!

275
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,589
The Chinese government insists

276
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:45,593
that someone take responsibility
for the death of our consul.

277
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:49,229
What does that mean, "take responsibility"?

278
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:52,676
Now, I believe
you were only following orders.

279
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:56,673
Tell us who gave you orders
and I'll let you go.

280
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,910
I'm not telling you anything.

281
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,711
I believe you're gonna change your mind.

282
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,269
- Yes?
- <i> Have you redeployed your men?</i>

283
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:31,069
- Yes, I have.
- Bill, it's Jack. Uplink is on.

284
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,879
<i> You sure they followed</i>
<i>your instructions?</i>

285
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,838
- <i> I'm sure. </i>
- It's starting to rain pretty hard.

286
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,911
Michelle...

287
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,237
do you love Tony?

288
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,588
- Yes, I love him.
- <i>Good. </i>

289
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:50,039
If I find out you're trying to play me,
the first thing I'll do is blow his brains out.

290
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:54,159
Don't think there's anything you can do
to stop it. There's not. You understand?

291
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,755
- OK. I understand.
- <i>Good. Stay by the phone. </i>

292
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:03,872
All com analysts, clone that call
and filter it through all our servers.

293
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,838
- Do you have multiple source?
- No, just one feed, low res.

294
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:10,549
I know the configuration, Edgar.
I need to know if we can multiplex.

295
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,393
- We need to pinpoint the source.
- I was gonna do that.

296
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:16,756
This is happening now.
I shouldn't have to walk you through this.

297
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,400
- Dammit!
- You don't have to. I'm setting it up now.

298
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:22,438
Go to Delta two, Edgar. It's all there.

299
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:27,150
I will not let this thing fall apart
because of technical incompetence.

300
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,194
All right. All our visible forces
have been pulled away from this street.

301
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,032
OK, good.

302
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,191
Jack.

303
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:53,518
We've got something.
Building three, west entrance.

304
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,670
Edgar, video feed.

305
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,910
- Yes.
OK, we're on our way.

306
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,434
- OK, it's them.
I've got a gun on Tony.

307
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,954
My finger's on the trigger.
If I move it, he'll die.

308
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,315
I told you, I moved my men.

309
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:20,277
She's completely in the open. She's running
a huge risk exposing herself like that.

310
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:30,633
So far, so good.
- She's crossing the street.

311
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,349
When she gets near the car, she can't
stay on top of him. That's our chance.

312
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:39,434
- She's moving towards the black jag.
- All teams, hold your position.

313
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:43,274
Here's the deal. Once we're in the car
and have cleared the area,

314
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,591
I'm gonna call you and I'm gonna tell you
where you can find Tony.

315
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,874
OK.

316
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:58,274
- All right, move. Everybody, move.
- Bill, not yet! All teams, stand down.

317
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:04,230
I see your men. You lied to me, you
bitch. You are not gonna take me alive, got it?

318
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,111
No! No!

319
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:32,313
Bill, they're gone. She blew herself up
in the car. She took Tony with her.

320
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,630
<i>They're gone. </i>

321
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:03,909
- Bill Buchanan requested a conference call.
- Yes, sir. We were waiting for you to begin.

322
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,839
- Bill, we're all here. Go ahead.
- <i>I'm afraid that Marwan's associate,</i>

323
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:11,718
the woman we hoped
would help us locate the missile,

324
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,995
has killed herself and one of our agents.

325
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,071
Oh, my God.

326
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:19,994
Bill, did she leave behind
any physical evidence that could help us?

327
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,877
It doesn't appear so.

328
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,997
So, what is CTU gonna do now
to find the missile?

329
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,275
Mr President, at this point,

330
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:34,149
CTU has no reasonable expectation of finding
the missile before it reaches its target.

331
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:38,439
This is it. It's going to happen.
What do we do?

332
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:43,556
At this point we have no choice
but to alert all state and federal agencies

333
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:47,519
and focus all our resources
on managing the aftermath.

334
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,239
But we don't even know the missile's target.

335
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:54,996
I know. We can assume it will be a major city,
but no matter what the target is,

336
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:58,595
there will be widespread panic
across this country.

337
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:02,514
We need to mobilise the army
and the National Guard in every state

338
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,353
and draw up a declaration of martial law.

339
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,476
Yes, we need to do that.

340
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,635
Bill.

341
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:15,077
All federal agencies need to prepare
for the aftermath of a nuclear attack.

342
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:18,835
CTU's priority should be
disaster management.

343
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:22,276
- Redeploy your people now.
- Understood.

344
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,189
Edgar Stiles.

345
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:31,671
Tell Jack the field operation is over. Have him
bring his people back here immediately.

346
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,512
<i>Got it. </i>

347
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:42,470
The worst disaster in this country's history
has taken place on my watch.

348
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:46,990
I gave you the responsibility to stop this.

349
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,950
You've failed me, David,

350
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,634
and you've failed your country.

351
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:37,989
I can't even imagine
what you must be feeling.

352
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:42,596
I know part of you is second-guessing
your decision...

353
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:47,353
but you couldn't place Tony's life

354
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,716
before the lives of
potentially millions of people.

355
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:54,998
You made exactly the decision Tony would
have wanted you to make. That's our job.

356
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,355
That's why we sign on.

357
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,638
We decided we were gonna leave this.

358
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:09,033
Go somewhere and start again.

359
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:14,437
- Michelle.
- I wanna get to work and find this missile.

360
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:18,274
- No, no. I want you to go home.
- I'll be OK, Bill.

361
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:22,197
It's not advice. It's an order.

362
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,953
- Buchanan.
- Sir, Jack said he's not pulling his men out.

363
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:40,510
- We have orders from the White House.
- Yeah, but he says he's not ready.

364
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:43,353
Put him on the videophone
in the situation room.

365
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:50,636
<i> You lied to me, you bitch. </i>
<i>You are not gonna take me alive, got it?</i>

366
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,675
Play it again.
Give me more volume on the phone.

367
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,273
- We need to redeploy.
- Do it!

368
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,998
Jack.

369
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:01,274
Tony's gone.

370
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:06,519
I'm sorry, Curtis.
Look, just play it again, please.

371
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,599
Yeah.

372
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:17,075
Jack, you've got a phone call.

373
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,799
- This is Bauer.
- <i> Jack, why haven't you redeployed?</i>

374
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,713
- <i>The operation's over. </i>
- Because it doesn't make any sense.

375
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:26,793
Everything we know about this woman
tells us she's a professional, not a fanatic.

376
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:31,396
<i>We had her cornered. Her next move was</i>
<i>to negotiate for her freedom, not kill herself. </i>

377
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:34,153
In theory I agree with you,
but you saw what I saw.

378
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:38,153
All I saw were two darkened figures
concealed by an umbrella in an explosion,

379
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,629
and I saw that from half a block away.

380
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:45,111
Jack, you've got to focus now. Nobody here
is holding you responsible for Tony's death.

381
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,839
- <i>Let this go. </i>
- You're not listening. All I want...

382
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:52,835
We reviewed the tactical feed.
There's nothing to suggest we were deceived.

383
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,275
<i>Look, I know Tony was your friend,</i>

384
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,511
<i>and you probably feel responsible</i>
<i>for getting him involved... </i>

385
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:03,958
This is not about Tony! This is about her,
and until I can absolutely confirm she is dead,

386
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:07,635
I am maintaining this perimeter
and I am gonna continue this search.

387
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,790
I'm under orders from the White House.

388
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:13,031
You have ten minutes,
then I want you to move out.

389
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:18,517
- Can you enhance the image from here?
- Not in the field.

390
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,239
Then play it again.

391
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:27,792
- <i> Here's the deal. </i>
- I still can't hear properly. Give me a headset.

392
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:33,113
<i>... I'm gonna call you and I'm gonna tell you</i>
<i>where you can find Tony. </i>

393
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:41,671
<i>I see your men. You lied to me, you bitch. </i>

394
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,797
<i>You are not gonna take me alive, got it?</i>

395
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:50,279
- Play back the last 15 seconds.
- What are you seeing?

396
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:53,511
It's not what I'm seeing.
Come on, play it back.

397
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:59,352
<i>I see your men. You lied to me, you bitch. </i>

398
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,238
It's pouring rain.
You see it bouncing off the car.

399
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:06,598
- You can't hear it on her side of the call.
- She was making that call from indoors.

400
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:09,558
She'd want a position
with a clean line of sight to the car.

401
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:13,315
That would put her in the building
the couple exited from. Get teams ready.

402
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:16,392
All teams, we're gonna converge
on building 11.

403
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,316
- <i> Converge on building 11.</i>
- <i> Copy that. </i>

404
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:31,556
Well, they're heading back in.
Looks like my neighbours died for nothing.

405
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:36,790
They know you're still in here.

406
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,195
Open up the palm of your hand.

407
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,475
Here are the keys.

408
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,549
Take off your cuffs.

409
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,151
Put these on. We're getting outta here.

410
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:11,675
OK, now cuff yourself back up.

411
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,710
Let's go.

412
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:04,956
We've got every way in and out covered
and men going room by room.

413
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:07,679
- We need to take her alive.
- Everyone's aware.

414
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,877
<i> Agent Bauer. </i>
<i>We found fresh blood outside an apartment. </i>

415
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,393
- Where?
- <i>208.</i>

416
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,948
- Stand down until we get there.
- <i>Copy that. </i>

417
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,994
Curtis, take the door.

418
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,116
Curtis, she went this way.

419
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,715
Turn around.

420
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:20,989
Move.

421
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:25,029
Don't move! Drop the gun.

422
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:28,237
- It's over.
- Take one more step and I'll kill him.

423
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,754
Do it, Jack. Do what you have to do.

424
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,671
Shut up.

425
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:38,630
Do you really have what it takes to let me
kill him while you're looking him in the eye?

426
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,515
Yes.

427
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,831
I believe you.

428
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:48,552
So what's to stop me from shooting him?

429
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:55,031
You can't...

430
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,917
kill me,

431
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,592
can you?

432
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,870
You need me.

433
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,191
Tony.

434
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:17,271
Hostile is down. I repeat, the hostile is down.

435
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:22,388
Get a medic down here.
I want her conscious as soon as possible.

436
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,790
Look at me. Are you OK?

437
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,472
Are you OK?

438
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:28,515
Yeah.

439
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:34,276
- Get me that medic now!
He's on his way.

440
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,316
Does Michelle know I'm alive?

441
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:40,518
No, not yet. I'll call CTU on my cell
so you can talk to her privately.

442
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,831
Thanks.

443
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,958
- <i>Buchanan. </i>
- This is Jack.

444
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:48,190
Jack, have you redeployed back to CTU?

445
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,953
- No. We just apprehended the hostile.
- What?

446
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,952
She's unconscious but she's unharmed.
Tony's OK too.

447
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:56,395
Thank God. I'll alert the White House.

448
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:00,393
OK, good. Bill, Tony wants to talk to Michelle.
Can you put her on the line?

449
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:04,189
She's not here. I sent her home.
I'll find her and patch her through.

450
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,191
Thanks.

451
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:33,390
- Hello?
- <i>Michelle, it's Bill. </i>

452
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,919
Tony's alive.

453
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,719
- What?
- <i>He wasn't in the car. </i>

454
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,597
<i>He's OK.</i>

455
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,915
I'll let Tony explain to you.
Hold on for him.

456
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,315
<i> Michelle, it's me. </i>

457
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,711
Tony.

458
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,114
- Oh, my God.
- <i>It's OK, sweetheart. </i>

459
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,031
Oh, my God.

460
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:01,829
- What happened?
- She made somebody else wear my clothes.

461
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,708
She needed to keep me alive until she got out.
Jack figured it out.

462
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:08,439
He was able to save me.

463
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:14,195
- I don't know what to say.
- You don't have to say anything, sweetheart.

464
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:17,317
I'm coming to CTU right now.
I'll see you in a few minutes.

465
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,311
Michelle.

466
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,790
I love you.

467
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,110
I love you, Tony.

468
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,838
Get Palmer patched through.
We'll have to structure a deal.

469
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,751
- All right.
- She's conscious.

470
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:37,798
Pick her up.
Call the White House now.

471
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:45,111
Where is Marwan?

472
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,911
That's what I thought.

473
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,150
We're both professionals.

474
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:56,392
You know that I can force this information
outta you, but I'm running outta time.

475
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:59,517
We never get second chances in our work,
but I'll give you one.

476
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:02,831
I have the power to give you a deal
signed by the president

477
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:06,037
that grants you immunity
from past and present crimes.

478
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:12,116
In exchange, you can help me find Marwan
and stop this warhead from hitting its target.

479
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,997
Do you understand?

480
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,235
You are either gonna help me now,

481
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,268
or I will kill you.

482
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,797
Show me the deal.

483
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:46,796
You were part of the team
that mounted the assault on our consulate,

484
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:50,793
an operation that resulted
in the death of our consul.

485
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,678
Who lead the mission?

486
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:57,036
- Who was responsible?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

487
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:59,793
Please, Mr Bern, you're wasting time.

488
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:02,440
Give us a statement and we'll release you.

489
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:07,548
I'm telling the truth. You'll have to release me
when CTU realises what's happened to me.

490
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:11,519
Actually, Mr Bern, no one will ever know.

491
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:14,114
No one will ever tell them.

492
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,596
What are you talking about?

493
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:23,195
The <i>China Queen</i> container ship
is moored at the port of San Diego.

494
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,316
If you don't give us our statement,

495
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:30,349
we'll put you on board and you will arrive
in 18 days in the port of Guangzhou.

496
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:35,639
Then we will transport you 2800 miles
to the province of Xinjiang

497
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:41,829
where you will be remanded to the maximum
security labour camp on the Siberian border.

498
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:47,830
- You wouldn't do that.
- Why wouldn't we, Mr Bern? We want justice.

499
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:52,512
If you won't tell us who is ultimately
responsible for the situation at the consulate,

500
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,989
that leaves you.

501
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:58,675
Your wife and your two daughters
will not be notified.

502
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:01,638
The US government will not be notified.

503
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:05,474
Therefore, there will be no chance
for prisoner exchange.

504
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:09,839
There will be positively no chance of escape...

505
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,955
for the rest of your life.

506
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,514
Decide, Mr Bern.

507
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:37,558
The <i>China Queen</i> is on a tight schedule.

508
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:42,236
- I don't know.
- All we want is a name.

509
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:45,717
A recorded statement
naming the person responsible

510
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:48,678
for what happened at the consulate.

511
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:56,231
Then...

512
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:00,600
- Then what happens?
- You will walk out of that door.

513
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:02,750
No. I meant...

514
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,796
to him.

515
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,472
As I said,

516
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,869
all we want is justice.

517
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,870
His name...

518
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:20,510
is Jack Bauer.

519
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:48,110
