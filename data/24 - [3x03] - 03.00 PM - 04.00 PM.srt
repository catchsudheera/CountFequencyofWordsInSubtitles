1
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,469
What if I can get us
a copy of Keeler's playbook?

2
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,439
- What exactly do you mean by playbook?
- His entire prep for tonight's debate.

3
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,956
- I told you to drop that.
- Listen. There is something you need to see.

4
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,508
- There's nothing I need to see.
- It's about Anne.

5
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:30,559
It's something we didn't know about her,
something that could damage us.

6
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,475
- Can I talk to you now?
- Of course. OK. What's up?

7
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:39,156
Chase and I have been going out for a while.
And it's starting to get serious.

8
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,038
I really care for him, Dad.
So what do you think?

9
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,997
I don't know what I think.

10
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:47,636
<i> We want the release
of Ram贸n Salazar.</i>

11
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:50,598
<i>If you refuse to comply,
the virus will be unleashed.</i>

12
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,113
It looks like the virus was delivered
in a crystalline form.

13
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,236
Maybe what you're looking for
is a white powder.

14
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,074
- So, it would look like cocaine? Or heroin?
- Yeah, that may even be the strategy.

15
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,835
Someone thinks they're selling coke,
in fact they're handling the virus.

16
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,757
- Where did you get that money?
- It doesn't matter. We needed it, I got it.

17
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:11,877
This is how you're gonna help your family?
By dealing drugs?

18
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,155
I'm not dealing 'em. It's a stupid delivery.

19
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,676
If that kid's got a bag of cocaine that's
got the virus in it and he doesn't know it,

20
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,115
I need to stop him putting it into circulation.

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,151
You didn't shoot up, did you?
You think you can hide it from me?

22
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,755
- I'm not trying to hide it. I'm trying to quit.
- People don't just quit.

23
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,479
I am not going on record with this addiction,
do you understand me?

24
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,233
You're the only person who knows,
and it's gonna stay that way.

25
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,589
Give me an update.

26
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,353
- Kyle's still in his house.
- What about the package?

27
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,556
- It's with him.
- And Ram贸n?

28
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,518
- Just waiting to come home.
- Good.

29
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,875
Have you downloaded everyone's folders?

30
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,315
Not yet. I'm pulling up details on the virus.

31
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:11,598
Don't waste too much time. All we need to
know is it kills within 24 hours of exposure

32
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,151
- and we believe Kyle Singer has it.
- I got all that. What's our approach to Singer?

33
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,959
Jack's meeting Nicole Duncan,
Health Services.

34
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,352
They're gonna take a Hazmat team over
to Singer's apartment. He's waiting for it now.

35
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,438
Son of a bitch.

36
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,797
- Hey, Jack. How you doing?
- OK, Nicole. How've you been?

37
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,235
Till this afternoon, I was doing fine.

38
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,990
You know, I tried to reach you
after I heard about Teri.

39
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,356
Yeah, I know.

40
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,910
After that I kind of withdrew.
I appreciated the calls, thanks.

41
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,476
We should get going.

42
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:10,199
I just ran Macer's epidemiological model.
Her estimates were off.

43
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:13,113
- Better or worse than we thought?
- Twice as bad.

44
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:18,069
She had 9% of the population infected
within a week but it's closer to 20%.

45
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:23,553
And the infection-to-mortality rate is higher
than her estimate. Almost 95% lethal.

46
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:29,430
I've been hunting germs for years,
I've not seen anything like this.

47
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,590
Great.

48
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,636
Are you feeling OK?

49
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,154
- Yeah, why?
- You're perspiring.

50
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,999
It's been nonstop since noon.

51
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,800
We'll be about eight minutes. It'd be great
to go over the quarantine protocols first.

52
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:59,431
- No problem.
- Good.

53
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:04,389
<i> If you refuse to comply,
the virus will be unleashed.</i>

54
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,749
<i>- We want the release of Ram贸n Salazar...
- Gael!</i>

55
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:14,592
Gael, take a look at this.
Closing in on the point of origin of this call.

56
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,914
- You see this code artefact here?
- Yeah.

57
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,118
We found a few more in this recording.
I think it's from a domestic switch-on mode.

58
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,158
Think the call was made from inside the US?

59
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,232
Maybe. I'm piping it over to your system.

60
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,276
- See if you can find a match.
- OK.

61
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,158
- But do it after the meeting.
- What meeting?

62
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,360
Tony's shifting resources to help Jack
in the field. He's closing in on the virus.

63
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,677
Gael. Jack needs the audio feed
when he gets to the apartment.

64
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,752
Tony needs me for something.
I'll do it after the meeting.

65
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,229
I need it before. Come do it now.

66
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,470
I can't! Stop bugging me.

67
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,551
I'll get it to you.

68
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,868
Fine.

69
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,277
Have you thought about how it will be
when Ram贸n comes back?

70
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,510
How it will be?

71
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,513
- Like it was before.
- Things have changed, Hector.

72
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,388
Nothing's changed.
He's only been gone three months.

73
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,550
You've changed.

74
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,757
You've been in charge
while he's been in prison.

75
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:34,116
Are you willing to give that up so easily?

76
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:46,468
- What is it?
- Bauer's about to intercept the package.

77
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,915
- How?
- I'm not sure, I'm about to find out.

78
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,195
- Is Gomez still on Kyle Singer?
- Of course.

79
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,077
He'll be fine.

80
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,510
Hey. How was the interview?

81
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,350
Fine.

82
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,594
What's up, Dad?

83
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,240
Your mother told me you paid the rent.

84
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,595
All three months we owed.

85
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,148
Yeah, I came into a little money.

86
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,830
How does a 19-year-old kid who doesn't
have a job come into a little money?

87
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:42,996
Tim and I, we went down
to the track the other day.

88
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,470
He knows this guy over at the stables
so, uh, we got a tip.

89
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,348
- Where did you get the money?
- Dad, what does it matter?

90
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:55,597
Honestly, the rent's paid for three months,
all right? The pressure's off us now.

91
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,274
Did you do something illegal?

92
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,237
No.

93
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:05,836
I told you, we went to Santa Anita
and we got lucky. I didn't do anything.

94
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,798
Don't lie to me, I got enough to worry about.

95
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:13,874
Now, this is my house. I pay the rent.
I take care of you and your mother.

96
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,274
Yeah, and when you get that job
you can go ahead and pay me back, huh?

97
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,555
- Wait, we're not done!
- We're done!

98
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,473
- Don't walk away!
- You should be thanking me!

99
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,028
Kyle! Kyle!

100
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,755
Open the door! Open the door!

101
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,394
His name's Kyle Singer.
We think he's transporting the virus,

102
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:40,155
- though it's likely he doesn't realize it.
- How could he not know?

103
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,550
Health Services believe it was made
to look like heroin or coke.

104
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:47,553
We know Singer was hired to deliver
a package from Mexico to Los Angeles.

105
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:51,918
- He thinks he's smuggling drugs.
- That's the working theory. Here's the thing:

106
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,993
Once Singer delivers the powder,
it's cut up and distributed around the city.

107
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,150
Then it's impossible to contain.

108
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,276
- Well, isn't LAPD grabbing Singer?
- No.

109
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,555
Why not? Can't they get there faster?

110
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,679
LAPD's not trained to handle a hot zone.
Jack's going in with Health Services.

111
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:11,436
We're running the operation from here,
updating the president in real-time. Now...

112
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,715
we have to approach Singer with care.

113
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,076
He has no idea how deadly the powder is.

114
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,798
<i> What's going on?</i>

115
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,519
<i>-  He's locked himself in.
- Did you fight again?</i>

116
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,511
<i> I'm not fighting...</i>

117
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,472
- He doesn't respect me.
- Of course he does.

118
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,472
You're going to have to talk to him.

119
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,552
<i> How can I talk
when there's a door between us?</i>

120
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:36,757
<i> Give him the benefit of the doubt.</i>

121
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,195
<i> Maybe there's more.</i>

122
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,595
- He said he won it at the track.
- He could've come up with a better lie.

123
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,832
- Maybe he was telling the truth.
- Come on, Helen. Where are you going?

124
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,639
- Wherever.
- Hey, hey, hey. What's in the bag?

125
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,029
- Clothes.
- Open it.

126
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,957
- What?
- Open the bag.

127
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:05,916
I'm warning you.
Open that bag or I'm gonna open it myself.

128
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,389
- Mom?
- Kyle, listen to your father.

129
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,552
- It's none of his business.
- While you live in my house it is.

130
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:14,950
Your house? This isn't your house,
you can't even pay the rent.

131
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,190
- Oh, Kyle!
- Hey!

132
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:25,273
- Aw, will you quit snooping, please?
- Don't even think about it.

133
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:42,077
What is this? Huh? Coke? Heroin?

134
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,070
- Give it back.
- What did you say?

135
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,516
- I need it.
- You need it? Are you some kind of junkie?

136
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,717
No. I'm just delivering it to this guy, OK?

137
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,950
- And if I don't get it to him...
- Who?

138
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,235
- It's just a guy, OK?
- Who?

139
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,276
Give me a name.

140
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,990
Kyle. Answer your father.

141
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,109
Just give it to me, OK?

142
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:13,193
Stop it! Stop it, both of you!

143
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,555
Both of you! Both of you, stop!

144
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:19,519
Sam! Sam! Don't, Sam! Kyle!

145
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:43,276
I can't reiterate this enough.
This is a credible threat.

146
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,875
Salazar's people will release this virus
if we don't find it first.

147
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,830
So let's get going.

148
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,994
- Thought you were meant to be with Dad?
- I was. He sent me back here.

149
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,150
- Why?
- To question Parker.

150
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,440
He already turned in Singer,
what else can you get?

151
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:19,513
- Nothing. And that's the point.
- I don't understand.

152
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,956
Your dad's sidelining me, Kim.
He's making me sit out.

153
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,270
- Why?
- Why do you think?

154
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:31,113
Because of us? Chase, I'm sorry.

155
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,113
He says he's protecting me, but I'm not
the one he's trying to protect here.

156
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:40,752
- You're not blaming me, are you?
- All I'm saying is we shouldn't have told him.

157
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:44,310
What were we supposed to do?
Sneak around until someone catches us?

158
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,630
- Well, we could have waited.
- Until when?

159
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,190
He'd have the same response
no matter when we told him.

160
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,509
I gotta deal with this kid Parker.

161
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,998
Jeffrey, the food's exceptionally bad today.

162
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:20,431
Aren't there laws in this country
for cruel and unusual punishment?

163
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,314
Tell Annicon I'm ready to talk.

164
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:39,591
Bauer couldn't tell me, but Salazar's got
leverage, enough to get him released.

165
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,036
I won't let this son of a bitch
erase the last few years of my life.

166
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,352
Call your friend at the State Department.
See what he can tell you.

167
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,071
- Annicon.
- Mr Annicon?

168
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,516
- Yeah.
- This is Jeff Benson, Salazar's guard.

169
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,637
- I know who you are.
- Sir, Salazar asked to see you.

170
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,678
- Why?
- He says he's ready to talk.

171
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,875
I'll be right there.

172
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,558
- Don't ask me why, just do it.
- All right.

173
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:25,154
- I hope you can get a refund.
- A refund?

174
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,754
From whoever sold you that load of crap.

175
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:32,231
Keeler will use this against you in this debate.
Ignoring it won't make it go away.

176
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,788
Neither will dignifying it with a response.

177
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:39,749
He'll claim that Anne perjured herself.
Which, in case you've forgotten, is a felony.

178
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,400
Anne is no felon.

179
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,871
The allegation itself is enough to damage
you. Now, come on, David. Please, think.

180
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:51,078
You know you can't go into this debate
without some kind of response.

181
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,073
- What do you propose?
- Talk to Anne.

182
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,276
Make sure she's told you everything.

183
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,636
- She has told me everything.
- Are you sure?

184
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:06,518
Ever since I started seeing Anne,
you've undermined our relationship.

185
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,388
- Just because you don't like her?
- You're right, I don't like her.

186
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,278
This isn't about me and Anne,
it's about you and Anne.

187
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:17,396
If she's got nothing to hide, fine,
she's got nothing to hide.

188
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:21,598
But you'd better find out before you face off
with Keeler on national television.

189
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:31,196
<i> Presidential flight check.
Presidential flight check.</i>

190
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,999
Did you ask your friend,
Jack Bauer, what's going on?

191
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:54,039
You did, didn't you?
But he wouldn't say.

192
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,557
It must be very frustrating, Luis,
being kept in the dark.

193
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,468
- You have something to tell me?
- I asked you here, didn't I?

194
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:07,030
Then start talking because
you used up my patience an hour ago.

195
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,795
Whoa. You are a dog with a bone, Luis.

196
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,519
Once you bite down, you don't let go.

197
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,831
When I'm out of here
I don't want you on me any more.

198
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,593
When you're out of here?

199
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,353
You are right.
In a few hours I am going home.

200
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,954
Really? And how will you manage that?

201
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,032
Hector's a good brother.

202
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,271
Unless he's got a key to this place,
you're not going anywhere.

203
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:36,229
But he does have a key. And when he turns it,
the last two years of your life,

204
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,834
all the hours you spent
away from your family,

205
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:44,517
all the work you've done to put me here,
will go away. Just like that.

206
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,399
I wanted you to hear it from me, Luis.

207
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,514
I wanted it to be the last thing you ever heard.

208
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,671
Argh!

209
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,634
Your son will be returned to you now.

210
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,029
I'm just saying that Kyle is in over his head.

211
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:41,317
We're not calling a lawyer.
He hasn't even been arrested.

212
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,437
- Not yet.
- Maybe he won't be.

213
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:48,308
If we leave it alone, don't do anything,

214
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,312
- maybe this will just go away.
- You can't be serious?

215
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:54,551
Why not, Sam?
Why do we have to let anybody know?

216
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,599
- Because it's against the law not to?
- What are you suggesting we do?

217
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:03,356
Call the police? Maybe they'll give us
a reward and we can pay our rent?

218
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:07,148
Right, that wasn't fair. I'm sorry.

219
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,591
Oh my God!

220
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,478
- What are you doing?
- Do you want to visit your son in jail?

221
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,233
Wait a minute! Helen!

222
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,310
Get back, get back!

223
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:33,234
- Kyle Singer! Kyle Singer!
- He's not here!

224
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:38,030
Isolate them. Draw blood for a full count and
get an oral swab. Seal all windows and vents.

225
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,196
No!

226
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,750
In here! In here!

227
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,313
Tony! The virus is out.
I repeat, the virus is out.

228
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,994
- Copy that, Jack. Where is it?
- The sewage system.

229
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,275
Get DWP to shut
all lines from ground zero.

230
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:03,273
It might be airborne. Get the fire department
and the LAPD to set up a perimeter.

231
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,238
- Tell them we've got a level three hot zone.
- Copy that.

232
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,435
Come in.

233
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:30,672
Wayne said you wanted to see me.
What's wrong?

234
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,956
Keeler.

235
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,838
He's bringing your ex-husband
into this debate.

236
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,514
The SEC's investigation into his company.

237
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,592
Ted was convicted
and served his sentence. You know that.

238
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,591
I know what you told me.

239
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:49,515
I told you all there is to know. Ted's company
was introducing a hypertension drug...

240
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,511
- And you reviewed the research?
- Yes.

241
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,957
- Which turned out to have been fabricated.
- Which Ted knew at the time and I didn't.

242
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,475
Now Ted's claiming that you both knew.

243
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:10,153
He can't reverse eight years
after giving testimony.

244
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,630
Well, he is. And he's willing
to go on record with the press.

245
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:17,429
- I don't know what to say except he's a liar.
- It's your word against his.

246
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,713
David.

247
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,109
You have reason to be suspicious.

248
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:28,399
God knows, you've been betrayed
by some of the people you've trusted most.

249
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,837
But I'm not Sherry.
I told you the whole truth once.

250
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,677
And I'm not going to defend it.

251
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:44,036
Because, if there's anything less
than complete trust between us...

252
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,029
I do trust you, Anne.

253
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,478
You should.

254
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,913
<i>- Yes?
-  We need to talk.</i>

255
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,116
I'm with Anne now.

256
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,829
- Let me guess, she denied everything.
- I believe her.

257
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:11,230
Well, listen. I might be able
to make this whole thing go away.

258
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:14,676
- How?
- Meet me in the auditorium. Alone.

259
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,790
All right.

260
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:24,076
Have you had a chance
to take a look at Nicole's field report yet?

261
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,720
- I'm almost done.
- What are your impressions?

262
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:31,112
- From what I've read so far, I'm optimistic.
- Think we'll be able to contain the virus?

263
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,556
- We should be able to limit casualties.
- Even if it's airborne?

264
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,438
There is a risk of it spreading,
but the team acted fast.

265
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:41,274
They evacuated and sealed off
the building and quarantined the Singers.

266
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,989
- When do we get their test results?
- Five minutes, ten tops.

267
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:48,789
- So, it looks like we lucked out, huh?
- Yeah, we deserve a little luck.

268
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,316
- I gotta go, but keep me in the loop.
- OK, you do the same.

269
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,149
LAPD's doing the perimeter. They need
wind vectors for the last 15 minutes.

270
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:00,232
Call meteorology. Extension 2112.

271
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:04,950
Tony, local news picked up the story about
the body being dumped at Health Services.

272
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,998
- They want a statement. What do I say?
- Nothing.

273
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:14,554
Tony. Warden Mitchell's on the phone. He's
calling from the prison, he says it's urgent.

274
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,555
Almeida.

275
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,312
- Mr and Mrs Singer?
- What the hell is going on here?

276
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,516
Because this is not about drugs.

277
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,034
- We think you've been exposed to a virus.
- A virus?

278
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:42,750
It's called the Cordilla virus. We believe Kyle
carried it in from Mexico without knowing.

279
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,991
- What do you mean? How?
- He thought he was carrying drugs.

280
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,196
So we've been exposed?

281
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:52,515
- I'm afraid so.
- What does that mean? Are we sick?

282
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,160
We'll keep you here until we get your results.

283
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,470
<i>Excuse me.</i>

284
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,949
- This is Bauer.
- Jack, it's Tony.

285
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:03,430
- I think Kyle's been exposed.
- We got an all-points on him.

286
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,193
- Have you set up a perimeter?
- We're doing all we can.

287
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,953
All agencies are in the loop
on a need-to-know basis.

288
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:12,510
- OK, good work.
- Listen, Jack, I know this isn't the best time,

289
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,398
but I just got some bad news
I figured you'd want to know.

290
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:18,153
- What's wrong?
- Luis Annicon was murdered.

291
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,391
- Murdered? How?
- Salazar's guard. We've got him in custody.

292
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:25,553
He claims Salazar had his son kidnapped
and threatened to kill him if he didn't.

293
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:29,428
- I'm sorry. I know you two worked closely.
- I'll have to get back to you.

294
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,159
- Is everything OK?
- I'm gonna get back to you.

295
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,673
- These results can't be right.
- They are.

296
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:56,548
- Check it again.
- I have. Blood, saliva and surface tests.

297
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:01,395
They're all negative. We can't find
even a trace amount of this virus.

298
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,916
What are you doing? You haven't showered.

299
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,833
- We're not at risk.
- What? I watched the powder get out.

300
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:21,480
It's harmless.
Some form of silicate, that's all.

301
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,790
- What?
- There is no virus in the powder.

302
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:27,429
We tested five samples,
there weren't even trace amounts.

303
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,478
Atmospheric and surface analysis
also came up negative

304
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:33,597
- and Kyle's parents tested negative as well.
- You're sure?

305
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,399
The only thing I'm unsure of
is being on the right trail.

306
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,472
The body dropped at Health Services
was linked to Singer.

307
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:42,632
Why would Salazar pay him
to bring a bag of worthless powder?

308
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,837
Fine, Jack.
But where do we even start looking?

309
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,995
I don't know.

310
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:57,830
Wait a second. Macer said the only way
to transport it was in crystalline form, right?

311
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:00,434
The only way it'll survive
outside a living body.

312
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,750
What if it was never outside a living body?

313
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:05,673
- What do you mean?
- Transported inside a living host?

314
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,957
What if Kyle Singer was infected
in Mexico before he even left?

315
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,508
Salazar has no power
if he's already infectious.

316
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,831
That's the point!
He wouldn't be contagious yet.

317
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:18,196
- The incubation period is 14 hours.
- Right. Think about it.

318
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,589
We know that Singer
was in Mexico 11 hours ago.

319
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:23,831
They haven't threatened to release it
for another three hours.

320
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:27,196
- The math adds up.
- We need to find Kyle Singer.

321
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,639
<i>- Hello?
- Linda?</i>

322
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:34,271
<i>- Kyle, I told you, I have nothing to say to you.
- No, no, listen to me, OK? I'm in trouble.</i>

323
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:37,272
- Yeah, because you're dealing drugs.
- I need your help.

324
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,716
<i>- What happened?
- My Dad found the stuff.</i>

325
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,836
We got in a fight.

326
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:46,708
I split, he's still got it.
I got to get this to them, all right?

327
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,189
<i>These guys are hard-core.
I gotta make it right.</i>

328
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,430
- Make it right? How?
- I don't know.

329
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:55,195
I was thinking I could pay 'em.
You know, just to keep them off my back.

330
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,874
- You want me to give you money?
- No, no. Just borrow.

331
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,712
<i>How much?</i>

332
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:04,078
- It's about 20 grand on the street.
- I don't have that kind of money, Kyle.

333
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:07,277
<i>- Doesn't your Dad keep some cash around?
- Not that much!</i>

334
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,590
Linda, listen to me!

335
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:14,678
These guys, they will kill me
if I don't give them something.

336
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:20,191
- Please. Please, anything will help right now.
- Now you want me to get involved in this?

337
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:23,192
Just... just let me borrow something.
Anything.

338
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:27,319
I will pay you back, I swear to God.

339
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,790
- Where are you?
- At the mall.

340
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,599
- I'll get there as soon as I can.
- Thank you.

341
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,912
<i> CTU knows the powder's not real.
They're after Singer.</i>

342
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,036
<i>- What do you want me to do?
- Stay with him.</i>

343
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:43,112
As soon as he's alone,
grab him and take him to containment.

344
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,398
We can't let the cops get him.
We need Singer to make this work.

345
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,271
<i> Don't lose the boy.</i>

346
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,113
<i>Follow him and do what you have to.
I want nothing to happen.</i>

347
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:09,149
<i>- There's no way we'll ever release Salazar.
-  What are the alternatives?</i>

348
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:12,676
<i>- CTU's very close to containing the threat.
- So, we should hold on?</i>

349
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:15,433
Yes, that's right.

350
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,398
All right, Stan, I'll make sure
you're kept in the loop.

351
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,517
- What is it, Wayne?
- I just spoke to Anne's ex-husband.

352
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,558
Now, listen. All Ted Packard wants is money.

353
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:28,758
- If we pay him, he'll recant before the debate.
- That's blackmail.

354
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:31,115
- That's business.
- I don't think so.

355
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,830
It's cheaper than trying to defend against
this allegation, which is going to hurt you.

356
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,229
I've faced down worse lies.

357
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,357
I think I've earned some credibility.

358
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,273
You read the polls this morning?

359
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,635
Because Keeler is closing the gap

360
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,076
and this race is much closer than it should be.

361
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:55,670
Now, listen, I know it's distasteful, David,
but in cost-benefit terms it's a no-brainer.

362
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,228
- Anne won't think so.
- Anne doesn't have to know.

363
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:01,357
I can't keep it from her.

364
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,228
Well, that's your choice.
But if this comes out

365
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:09,472
Anne will be on the front page
of every newspaper in this country.

366
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:12,632
She's not Sherry.
She's not equipped to handle that scrutiny.

367
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,518
And you will not be able to protect her from it.

368
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,232
Between this debate and the threat of
this outbreak, you have enough on your plate.

369
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:28,869
Don't be a martyr. Keep it simple.

370
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:35,189
We could have the money within the hour.

371
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,472
Do it.

372
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:04,877
What's going on?
They don't have their suits on. Are we OK?

373
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,190
- Yes. The powder was harmless.
- Thank God!

374
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,840
This was for nothing?
You scared the hell out of us.

375
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,115
Mr Singer, we still need to find your son.

376
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:15,909
- Is there anything you can tell us to help?
- Why? You said it was harmless.

377
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,232
We believe your son was infected with
the virus in Mexico before he came home.

378
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:24,074
We have three hours to find him
before he becomes contagious.

379
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:27,072
What are you saying?
That our son could die?

380
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:30,793
- Yes, that could happen.
- Oh, God.

381
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:34,077
Look, I know how difficult
this must be for you and I'm sorry.

382
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:37,470
But we need to find your son.
We need to find him now.

383
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:41,599
- Uh. Have you tried his cellphone?
- The line's been disconnected.

384
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:45,309
Oh, wait! Wait, wait, wait!

385
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,115
- He took my phone.
- What's the number?

386
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:53,158
818-555-0103.

387
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,674
OK. I'm gonna need one of you to call him.

388
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:03,150
This is my fault. Kyle never would've done
this if I could take care of my own family.

389
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,196
- No!
- Yes. You know it's true.

390
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,235
Tony, it's Jack.

391
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:09,596
Jack, I just spoke to LAPD.
They got a priority APB out on Singer.

392
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,716
Good. I think we've got a number on him.

393
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,792
All right. We'll thread the line
through a tracing matrix.

394
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:21,194
The number's 818-555-0103. I want you
to route the call back through my cellphone.

395
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:26,479
I need you to trace that number
and reroute the call through Jack's cellphone.

396
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,028
I'm going to need one of you
to make the call now.

397
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:34,911
I need you to keep him on the line
as long as possible so we can trace him.

398
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:38,758
What am I supposed to tell him?

399
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:41,115
The truth.

400
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,873
- Tony, you set?
- Yeah, we're ready.

401
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:55,990
<i>- Linda?
- Kyle, it's your father.</i>

402
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:00,551
- Dad?
- We need to talk.

403
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:05,236
Look, I don't know what you want to talk
about. I already know how pissed off you are.

404
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:09,950
Whatever you did, I know you were just
trying to help out your mom and me.

405
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:14,519
Well, unless you give back the stuff,
I gotta deal with the situation, OK?

406
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:18,149
Kyle, please, don't hang up. Please!

407
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:22,153
<i>Just listen to me.
What I'm telling you is important.</i>

408
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:26,119
<i>- Please. You have to come home.
- Dad, why do you sound different?</i>

409
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:31,114
I need you to trust me
on something I'm about to tell you.

410
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:35,034
<i>- Dad?
- You may have gotten a virus.</i>

411
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,957
<i>Something you picked up in Mexico.</i>

412
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:44,478
- What? How did you know I went to Mexico?
- It doesn't matter. But you may be sick.

413
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:47,950
And if you are then you need
to get checked out by a doctor.

414
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:51,112
Dad, I don't know what
you're talking about. I feel fine.

415
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,795
<i>I know it sounds crazy, but it's real.</i>

416
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,156
- There's some people here trying to help.
- Cops?

417
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:01,198
- Tony, have you got a lock on this trace?
- How much longer?

418
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:05,592
- I got a cell tower but it covers three miles.
- I can't believe this.

419
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:10,231
One minute you tell me that you love me and
the next you're selling me out to some cops.

420
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:16,156
They're not the police. They're just trying to
stop this virus before it becomes an outbreak.

421
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,151
Dad, I already told you, I feel fine.

422
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:23,268
They say you won't start feeling sick for
another few hours, but by then it'll be too late.

423
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,237
- Got a lock yet?
- How much longer?

424
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:28,232
- Ten seconds.
- What d'you want me to do? Turn myself in?

425
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:33,189
Because you may be sick. And if you are,
other people are going to get infected.

426
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,030
Tony!

427
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:37,237
Got it. He's at Los Feliz Mall,
between Vermont and Sunset.

428
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:40,517
Get his photo to mall security.
Tell them not to approach him.

429
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:44,354
Jack, you're 20 minutes away by car.
I can land a team there in ten minutes.

430
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:47,398
Fine. Tony, I don't want you taking Chase.

431
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,516
- Why not?
- I just don't.

432
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:54,230
Thank you very much. We'll notify you
when we have him in custody.

433
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,470
Please, help our son.

434
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,630
We will.

435
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:05,879
<i>- O'Brian.
-  Chloe, Tony's off site for a while.</i>

436
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:08,520
<i>- He is?
- Yeah. I'm taking over for a few hours.</i>

437
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,431
<i>- OK.
- Let people in your area know.</i>

438
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,750
<i>- OK, I will.
- Thanks.</i>

439
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:13,989
What was that?

440
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:18,437
- Michelle's taking over for a couple of hours.
- Where's Tony?

441
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:21,557
We've located Singer.
Jack can't get there so Tony's going.

442
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,756
What? Tony's not field ops.

443
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,957
They're really going out of their way
to cut you out of the loop.

444
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,952
Did you do something to piss off Jack?

445
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:33,718
Bad idea, Chase.
You're just gonna make things worse.

446
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:45,556
- Tony. I heard they found Kyle. Is it for real?
- We'll see. I'm meeting Jack there now.

447
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:49,997
OK, I'm done with Parker. He's said all
he's gonna say. I want back on the case.

448
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,389
We're handling that, Chase, all right?

449
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,677
Jack doesn't want me there.
Did he say why he's cutting me out?

450
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:58,433
He's your boss, it's his call.

451
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:04,469
This isn't right.
Did he tell you it's because of Kim?

452
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:09,196
He found out we're seeing each other
and this is how he's making me pay.

453
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,510
Take it up with Jack.

454
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,720
Just want to keep the line open for Tony.

455
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:17,430
<i>- Leave a message for Jack Bauer.
- Dammit, Jack!</i>

456
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:27,552
Chase. Chase!

457
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:32,114
I know my Dad can be hard,
but he'll come around.

458
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,714
- How do you know?
- Because I know my father.

459
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,792
Maybe you don't know him
as well as you think.

460
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:43,193
- What is that supposed to mean?
- Nothing. It's OK. Forget it, Kim.

461
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:48,230
Don't you think I feel bad enough already?
Because I do.

462
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,958
- We shouldn't have told him.
- Well, the only other option

463
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:59,831
is for us to stop seeing each other, which,
as far as I'm concerned, is not an option.

464
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,638
Or is it?

465
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,394
- Chase, what do you want?
- To be able to do my job.

466
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:10,995
Kim. We need you at your station.
Tony's about to land.

467
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,479
Tony Almeida, CTU.

468
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:40,597
We've found the guy you're looking for.
He's in the rotunda.

469
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:46,277
Bronson, watch down the east entrance.
Pearson, I want you in the security office.

470
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:10,678
- How long have you been using, Jack?
- What?

471
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:14,912
I did a rotation in rehab, you learn
to pick it up when someone's using.

472
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:19,676
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- You know exactly what I'm talking about.

473
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,510
How long?

474
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,231
For a while now.

475
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,549
It was the only way I could maintain
my cover with the Salazars.

476
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:40,359
- Are you high now?
- No!

477
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,875
- It's empty.
- Nicole, I told you, I'm fine.

478
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,315
- I'm not so sure.
- Then turn me in!

479
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:51,154
I don't want to turn you in, Jack.
I'm worried about you.

480
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,834
You don't have to be. I've kicked it.

481
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:01,358
I have a responsibility to stop this virus

482
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:06,719
and I am taking a calculated risk
that you are more of an asset than a liability.

483
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,275
Just please don't screw this up.

484
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:15,116
I won't.

485
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,475
Yeah?

486
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,836
- We found Singer. We're gonna pick him up.
- OK, where are you?

487
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,718
Second floor rotunda,
top of the north escalator. You?

488
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,917
<i>Unloading dock, north entrance. Got a visual?</i>

489
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:32,989
<i>Yeah.</i>

490
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:35,640
<i>- Where are your men?
- Posted on the main entrances.</i>

491
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:38,280
<i>- Good. We'll be there in a minute.
- All right.</i>

492
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:50,875
Have your men cover
all the parking-level exits. Let's go!

493
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:01,598
I don't want to cause any kind of commotion.

494
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:06,669
- CTU's about to move in on the kid.
- Stand down, it's too hot.

495
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:09,718
<i>- It's my only chance. He can't get caught.
- No, no. Wait!</i>

496
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,631
- I can't wait.
- Gomez!

497
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:15,030
- Wait here. We want to make a clean grab.
- Yes, sir.

498
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:36,119
- Kyle?
- Who are you?

499
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:41,678
My name's Tony Almeida.
I'm a federal agent, but I'm here to help you.

500
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:44,991
What your father told you
about your being sick is true.

501
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:48,595
- I don't believe you.
- Come with me, I'll prove it to you.

502
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,469
Get out of the way! Move!

503
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,919
Nicole, he's been hit in the neck!

504
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,197
Jimmy, give me your walkie-talkie.
We have an officer down.

505
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:47,511
Singer is not in custody.
I repeat, Singer is not in custody.

506
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:50,433
Maintain cover on all exits.
