1
00:00:15,293 --> 00:00:17,284
He's digging up old history.

2
00:00:17,373 --> 00:00:20,524
He claims that Keith murdered
the boy who raped Nicole.

3
00:00:20,613 --> 00:00:24,128
David, you can't seriously think
that our son might be a killer.

4
00:00:24,213 --> 00:00:27,922
Now I wanna know what you did after
you found out your sister had been raped.

5
00:00:28,013 --> 00:00:30,243
And I told you. I'm not gonna answer.

6
00:00:31,493 --> 00:00:34,087
Honey, it's me.
Have you found Kim yet?

7
00:00:34,173 --> 00:00:36,482
- We're at St Mark's Hospital.
- Hospital?

8
00:00:36,573 --> 00:00:39,326
- Janet was in a car accident.
- What about Kim?

9
00:00:39,413 --> 00:00:42,371
I don't know. She tried to call me
and she was in a panic...

10
00:00:42,453 --> 00:00:45,126
I need you to stay there.
I'll get there as soon as I can.

11
00:00:45,213 --> 00:00:47,204
Whatever happens,

12
00:00:48,013 --> 00:00:51,528
I'm gonna stay with you until we find Kim.

13
00:00:53,653 --> 00:00:57,885
- What happened to the other girl?
- Maybe, uh, she wasn't quite dead.

14
00:00:57,973 --> 00:01:01,602
You're either dead or you're not dead.
Let me show you.

15
00:01:02,093 --> 00:01:03,811
No!

16
00:01:08,373 --> 00:01:11,331
This body is connected to
the disappearance of my daughter.

17
00:01:11,413 --> 00:01:13,449
- So who was this?
- I don't know yet.

18
00:01:13,533 --> 00:01:16,605
George, as crazy as this sounds,
you're gonna have to trust me.

19
00:01:16,693 --> 00:01:21,244
This is gonna look very bad for us
if something happens to Palmer tonight.

20
00:01:31,373 --> 00:01:35,286
- She's crashing. Get Dr Collier.
- She's on her way in.

21
00:01:35,373 --> 00:01:38,126
- What have we got?
- BP's dropping. She's in v-tach.

22
00:01:38,213 --> 00:01:42,092
- BP's 90/50.
- Give her an amp of epi. Let's go at 200.

23
00:01:42,173 --> 00:01:43,925
Yes, Doctor.

24
00:01:44,013 --> 00:01:46,004
Epi's in.

25
00:01:47,973 --> 00:01:50,362
- Start.
- Clear.

26
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:56,083
- Nothing.
- Again. 300.

27
00:01:56,173 --> 00:01:59,006
- 300. Start.
- Clear.

28
00:02:00,133 --> 00:02:04,809
- Blood pressure still dropping.
- Nothing. Doctor?

29
00:02:05,613 --> 00:02:08,446
- Go again.
- 360. Charge.

30
00:02:08,533 --> 00:02:10,922
- Clear.
- Clear.

31
00:02:12,093 --> 00:02:14,084
No rhythm.

32
00:02:18,053 --> 00:02:20,283
One more time.

33
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:23,012
- Charge.
- 360. Charge.

34
00:02:23,093 --> 00:02:24,890
Clear.

35
00:02:29,693 --> 00:02:30,967
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

36
00:02:31,053 --> 00:02:33,692
- Jack, where are you?
- I'm still in the West Side.

37
00:02:33,773 --> 00:02:37,527
- You said you were coming here.
- I'll be there soon. Is Janet out of surgery?

38
00:02:37,613 --> 00:02:40,605
There's been a complication.
They're working on it now.

39
00:02:40,693 --> 00:02:43,924
Listen. Do not let anyone near Janet
who doesn't belong there.

40
00:02:44,013 --> 00:02:46,732
- What do you mean?
- I think she might be in danger.

41
00:02:46,813 --> 00:02:48,644
- From whom?
- I'll explain later.

42
00:02:48,733 --> 00:02:51,293
- Until then do not mention this to anyone.
- OK.

43
00:02:51,373 --> 00:02:53,933
- I'll be there soon.
- OK.

44
00:02:56,133 --> 00:02:57,612
Clear.

45
00:03:05,133 --> 00:03:07,328
- Whose car?
- Penticoff was paid to pick it up

46
00:03:07,413 --> 00:03:09,802
and get rid of this.

47
00:03:12,053 --> 00:03:15,329
- Oh, my God. Who is it?
- That's what you're gonna find out.

48
00:03:15,413 --> 00:03:18,564
Somehow all of this is
connected to Senator Palmer.

49
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:23,045
- They didn't leave much of his face.
- Or his fingers or teeth.

50
00:03:23,133 --> 00:03:25,966
- Is the forensic here?
- Not yet. He's on his way.

51
00:03:27,533 --> 00:03:30,093
Call me as soon as you got a name.

52
00:03:34,493 --> 00:03:37,246
Nina! I need a favour.

53
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:39,528
They're starting to add up, Jack.

54
00:03:39,613 --> 00:03:42,525
Don't tell anyone
I requisitioned this for personal use.

55
00:03:42,613 --> 00:03:43,932
Personal use?

56
00:03:44,013 --> 00:03:47,483
Yes. Could you please patch me
through to hospital security?

57
00:03:47,573 --> 00:03:51,452
Thank you. You know Kim's friend,
the girl she went out with tonight?

58
00:03:51,533 --> 00:03:54,286
She turned up at St Mark's ER.
She got hit by a car.

59
00:03:54,373 --> 00:03:56,841
- Think she knows where Kim is?
- It's my only chance.

60
00:03:56,933 --> 00:03:59,731
I'm meeting Teri at the hospital now.
Get me that name.

61
00:03:59,813 --> 00:04:03,203
Yes, hello. My name is Jack Bauer.
I'm a federal agent.

62
00:04:03,293 --> 00:04:07,411
I'm coming to you now but I wanted to give
you a heads-up on one of your patients.

63
00:04:07,493 --> 00:04:13,762
I think her life might be in danger. Yes, I'll be
there in ten minutes. Her name is Janet York.

64
00:04:19,173 --> 00:04:23,769
Jack requisitioned a chopper but he didn't
log a destination. Where's he going?

65
00:04:23,853 --> 00:04:26,686
- He's tracking a lead.
- Ignoring protocol again?

66
00:04:26,773 --> 00:04:30,083
First he assaults an agent,
then he breaks a prisoner out of jail.

67
00:04:30,173 --> 00:04:33,768
- What the hell's going on here?
- Stop following me, Tony.

68
00:04:36,413 --> 00:04:42,170
- I prefer to think of it as watching your back.
- When I need your help, I'll ask for it.

69
00:04:59,053 --> 00:05:01,931
Yeah, we got a little off schedule
but we're good now.

70
00:05:02,013 --> 00:05:04,004
Yeah, I know.

71
00:05:10,653 --> 00:05:13,372
You see what happens when you lie?

72
00:05:15,533 --> 00:05:18,001
- Don't ever lie to me, Rick.
- I won't.

73
00:05:18,373 --> 00:05:20,762
Oh, I know you won't.

74
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:23,492
- Now bury your friend.
- Where?

75
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:25,564
In the ground.

76
00:05:51,693 --> 00:05:54,685
- We gotta get outta here.
- What do you mean "we"?

77
00:05:54,773 --> 00:05:58,322
I don't know how you hooked up with
these guys, but they don't trust you.

78
00:05:58,413 --> 00:06:00,722
You just saw Gaines kill your friend.

79
00:06:00,813 --> 00:06:02,929
- He's not gonna let you walk away.
- Shut up.

80
00:06:03,013 --> 00:06:05,481
The only way either of us
is gonna stay alive is...

81
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:08,167
I said shut up!

82
00:06:19,293 --> 00:06:24,048
Sources say the senator spent the night
working on a party-unification speech

83
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:26,852
which he's set to deliver later...

84
00:06:26,933 --> 00:06:30,972
- How did you get past Secret Service?
- Good to see you too, Sherry.

85
00:06:31,053 --> 00:06:36,286
Listen. David has a meeting and the polls
open in an hour, so whatever you're doing...

86
00:06:36,373 --> 00:06:38,762
- David asked me to come.
- Why, Carl?

87
00:06:38,853 --> 00:06:41,048
I don't know.

88
00:06:50,253 --> 00:06:53,051
I've gotta get ready, and so do you.

89
00:06:53,133 --> 00:06:53,929
Mm-hm.

90
00:06:58,693 --> 00:07:01,810
What's the big emergency, David?
I thought we had a game plan.

91
00:07:01,893 --> 00:07:05,283
We did. Until I found out my son lied to me.

92
00:07:06,973 --> 00:07:09,851
That he's been lying to me for seven years.

93
00:07:09,933 --> 00:07:11,924
What's going on?

94
00:07:12,773 --> 00:07:17,642
Why would Maureen Kingsley
run a story this big unless it were true?

95
00:07:17,733 --> 00:07:21,203
Are you saying you believe
her accusation about Keith?

96
00:07:21,293 --> 00:07:26,003
I'm saying my son was involved
in Gibson's death and you covered it up.

97
00:07:26,093 --> 00:07:30,803
- Not only from the law, from me.
- David...

98
00:07:30,893 --> 00:07:35,444
Someone altered the hospital records
to make it look like Keith wasn't involved.

99
00:07:35,533 --> 00:07:38,127
That could only have been you.

100
00:07:40,733 --> 00:07:43,008
Look me in the eye...

101
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:46,608
and tell me what happened.

102
00:07:48,453 --> 00:07:53,129
You sure you wanna know? You might not
like what you find if you open that door.

103
00:07:54,093 --> 00:07:57,324
It's already open and I'm listening.

104
00:08:07,373 --> 00:08:10,206
The night Gibson raped Nicole,

105
00:08:10,293 --> 00:08:13,808
while Sherry was still at the hospital
and you were flying back,

106
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:16,282
Keith went to see Gibson.

107
00:08:18,013 --> 00:08:20,368
How do you know this?

108
00:08:20,453 --> 00:08:23,445
Keith told me. Your son came to me, David.

109
00:08:23,533 --> 00:08:28,163
He said Gibson pulled a knife.
I took him at his word. It was an accident.

110
00:08:28,253 --> 00:08:31,131
He was defending himself.

111
00:08:31,813 --> 00:08:34,850
So you made it look like
Keith was never there?

112
00:08:34,933 --> 00:08:37,527
As far as I was concerned, he never was.

113
00:08:37,613 --> 00:08:42,687
Why didn't we just go to the police? If it was
self-defence, Keith would have been cleared.

114
00:08:42,773 --> 00:08:45,492
Maybe, but your career
would have been over.

115
00:08:45,573 --> 00:08:48,167
Gibson was white, David.

116
00:08:51,013 --> 00:08:55,006
- I still wouldn't have covered it up.
- Are you so sure?

117
00:08:55,093 --> 00:08:57,482
It was my decision, not yours.

118
00:09:02,893 --> 00:09:05,691
I don't want you anywhere near me...

119
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:09,847
or my family... ever again.

120
00:09:11,253 --> 00:09:14,325
You have never needed me
more than you need me now.

121
00:09:19,853 --> 00:09:21,844
Get out.

122
00:09:28,013 --> 00:09:30,925
Before you finish crucifying me...

123
00:09:32,693 --> 00:09:35,571
save some nails for your wife.

124
00:09:36,133 --> 00:09:39,170
- Sherry didn't know anything about this.
- No?

125
00:09:39,253 --> 00:09:42,290
How do you think Keith
got to me in the first place?

126
00:10:19,133 --> 00:10:23,012
- What are you doing?
- What does it look like?

127
00:10:23,093 --> 00:10:25,732
- I said I don't need...
- I heard.

128
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:46,131
Think I wanted to leave Janet there?

129
00:10:47,053 --> 00:10:49,851
Everything just got so crazy.

130
00:10:52,853 --> 00:10:55,083
All we had to do was hang out with you guys.

131
00:10:55,173 --> 00:10:58,404
Nobody was supposed to get hurt.
None of this was supposed to go down.

132
00:10:58,493 --> 00:11:01,690
- What did you think was gonna happen?
- I don't know.

133
00:11:01,773 --> 00:11:06,528
- Smoking that's really gonna help.
- I just can't believe this is happening.

134
00:11:06,613 --> 00:11:09,366
It is, and you can sit there
feeling sorry for yourself

135
00:11:09,453 --> 00:11:13,332
or you can get up and help me figure
out a way to get us out of here.

136
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:44,646
- Claude Davenport. Hospital security.
- Jack Bauer. Thanks for mobilising.

137
00:11:44,733 --> 00:11:47,805
I put a man at each end of the ICU corridor.
Should lock it down.

138
00:11:47,893 --> 00:11:50,805
- They know not to let anyone in or out?
- Only hospital staff.

139
00:11:50,893 --> 00:11:52,724
- Good.
- Tell me what this is about?

140
00:11:52,813 --> 00:11:55,043
I wish I could.

141
00:11:55,133 --> 00:11:57,124
- Teri.
- Jack.

142
00:11:58,613 --> 00:12:01,969
- Thank God. Thank God.
- It's OK. It's OK. I'm here now.

143
00:12:02,973 --> 00:12:06,204
Oh, don't leave me.
Don't ever leave me again. OK?

144
00:12:06,293 --> 00:12:08,887
I promise I won't.

145
00:12:09,493 --> 00:12:12,053
I'll be walking the floor if you need anything.

146
00:12:12,133 --> 00:12:14,124
Thank you, Claude.

147
00:12:18,573 --> 00:12:21,167
It's gonna be OK.

148
00:12:23,973 --> 00:12:27,204
- Tell me about Janet.
- She's stable.

149
00:12:27,293 --> 00:12:30,444
- Can she talk?
- No, not yet.

150
00:12:30,533 --> 00:12:34,446
What did you mean before about
her being in danger? Danger from whom?

151
00:12:34,533 --> 00:12:36,649
Someone who doesn't
want her talking to me.

152
00:12:36,733 --> 00:12:38,928
You must be Jack.

153
00:12:39,013 --> 00:12:42,164
Alan, yeah. This is my husband Jack.

154
00:12:42,253 --> 00:12:44,050
- Hi.
- Hi.

155
00:12:44,133 --> 00:12:46,567
Alan's been a great friend tonight, Jack.

156
00:12:46,653 --> 00:12:50,282
- I'm glad your daughter's OK.
- Thank you. Thank you very much.

157
00:12:50,373 --> 00:12:53,092
Gave us a good scare,
but she pulled through.

158
00:12:53,173 --> 00:12:56,210
When she's up to it,
I'll need to ask her a few questions.

159
00:12:56,293 --> 00:12:59,330
But, Jack, my daughter's
been through a lot. Um...

160
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:03,927
If the doctor says it's OK.

161
00:13:05,893 --> 00:13:10,409
The guys that Kim and Janet were with
tonight, Teri told me you didn't know them.

162
00:13:10,493 --> 00:13:14,088
- No. No. Janet never mentioned them.
- Are you close to Janet?

163
00:13:16,653 --> 00:13:17,642
She's my daughter.

164
00:13:17,733 --> 00:13:20,042
- But you don't know who she goes out with.
- Jack.

165
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:23,842
No, not tonight, I didn't,
but apparently you didn't either.

166
00:13:23,933 --> 00:13:26,242
- What are you doing?
- Trying to find Kim.

167
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:28,051
By treating Alan as a suspect?

168
00:13:28,133 --> 00:13:31,523
He can handle a few questions.
Understand? Our daughter's missing.

169
00:13:31,613 --> 00:13:35,367
- Of course I do.
- Alan, would you excuse us for a minute?

170
00:13:35,453 --> 00:13:38,172
Jack. What's going on?

171
00:13:38,253 --> 00:13:42,041
I don't know what you were doing for
the last five hours, but Alan was with me.

172
00:13:42,133 --> 00:13:46,649
- I'm sorry if that makes you feel bad but...
- Hold on one minute.

173
00:13:46,733 --> 00:13:48,928
I'm here to see my brother. My bag?

174
00:13:49,013 --> 00:13:51,891
I'm not gonna open the briefcase.
I wanna see my brother.

175
00:13:51,973 --> 00:13:54,931
- What's the problem here?
- There's no problem.

176
00:13:55,013 --> 00:13:57,891
- What you got in the briefcase?
- Don't worry about it.

177
00:13:57,973 --> 00:14:00,771
- What's in the briefcase?
- Don't worry about it.

178
00:14:00,853 --> 00:14:02,844
Get off me!

179
00:14:03,733 --> 00:14:05,086
What is this?

180
00:14:05,173 --> 00:14:07,733
- It's my medication.
- What kind of medication?

181
00:14:07,813 --> 00:14:10,691
- Ben? Ben? What is going on?
- Virgil's in pain.

182
00:14:10,773 --> 00:14:15,324
- You guys aren't giving him what he needs.
- It's OK. We're taking care of your brother.

183
00:14:15,413 --> 00:14:18,485
His brother's up in detox...

184
00:14:18,573 --> 00:14:20,962
You guys just don't get it!

185
00:14:26,173 --> 00:14:28,164
I'm sorry.

186
00:14:32,733 --> 00:14:34,724
Come on.

187
00:14:49,453 --> 00:14:52,047
What did Carl want?

188
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:59,291
I know about Keith.

189
00:14:59,373 --> 00:15:01,967
Know what about Keith?

190
00:15:03,253 --> 00:15:08,850
That he went to Carl to cover up the Gibson
boy's death. Keith was there, wasn't he?

191
00:15:08,933 --> 00:15:12,130
Look, David, just because Carl
wants to feed you some story...

192
00:15:12,213 --> 00:15:16,252
Are you sure you're not the one
that's feeding me stories?

193
00:15:24,653 --> 00:15:27,247
The thing I can't understand,

194
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:32,803
what I keep asking myself,
is why you hid this from me.

195
00:15:39,933 --> 00:15:42,208
- I wanted to tell you, David.
- But you didn't.

196
00:15:42,293 --> 00:15:45,490
- Carl said you'd be exposed.
- Don't put this on Carl.

197
00:15:46,733 --> 00:15:49,964
You keep your own counsel, Sherry.
You always have.

198
00:15:51,413 --> 00:15:55,201
Nothing I say to you is gonna
make you feel any better. I know that.

199
00:15:55,293 --> 00:15:59,172
I did what I thought was right
for our family and for your career.

200
00:16:11,613 --> 00:16:13,604
What about Nicole?

201
00:16:18,733 --> 00:16:21,327
Did she know too?

202
00:16:24,013 --> 00:16:26,208
- We were protecting you.
- Really?

203
00:16:26,293 --> 00:16:29,285
- Yes.
- Or were you protecting your chance

204
00:16:29,373 --> 00:16:32,888
- to move into the White House?
- I am as ambitious as you are, David.

205
00:16:32,973 --> 00:16:37,012
- That's why you married me.
- No, I married you because I love you.

206
00:16:37,093 --> 00:16:39,891
- I thought we were working together.
- We still are.

207
00:16:39,973 --> 00:16:42,487
- Well, it doesn't feel that way.
- David.

208
00:16:47,053 --> 00:16:49,487
What are you gonna do?

209
00:16:50,213 --> 00:16:51,851
I don't know.

210
00:16:51,933 --> 00:16:55,812
Look, you can be as angry at me as you want.

211
00:16:56,333 --> 00:17:01,646
But I'm telling you, we should do everything
we can to keep this thing from coming out.

212
00:17:03,493 --> 00:17:06,087
It's too late for that.

213
00:17:11,093 --> 00:17:13,482
Well, I'm sorry to hear you say that,

214
00:17:13,573 --> 00:17:17,885
because you'll lose a lot more
than the election if it does.

215
00:17:20,253 --> 00:17:23,484
Are you prepared to send our son to jail?

216
00:18:08,013 --> 00:18:10,322
Everything was always a game with Dan.

217
00:18:10,413 --> 00:18:14,326
He acted like nothing could touch him,
and I bought into it.

218
00:18:14,853 --> 00:18:18,368
- So did Janet.
- I'd give anything to turn back the clock.

219
00:18:18,453 --> 00:18:20,648
Me too.

220
00:18:22,453 --> 00:18:25,729
I spend every day trying
to get away from my mother...

221
00:18:26,693 --> 00:18:30,003
and now I can't stop wishing she were here.

222
00:18:32,053 --> 00:18:34,567
She must be freaking.

223
00:18:34,653 --> 00:18:37,247
It must be nice having a mom you like.

224
00:18:37,933 --> 00:18:40,049
You don't like yours?

225
00:18:40,133 --> 00:18:42,601
Not all women are meant to be mothers.

226
00:18:44,173 --> 00:18:47,085
- I'm sorry.
- It's not your problem.

227
00:18:50,053 --> 00:18:52,044
Rick...

228
00:18:53,013 --> 00:18:55,402
We gotta get out of here.

229
00:19:00,253 --> 00:19:02,687
Come with me.

230
00:19:05,373 --> 00:19:07,364
Let's go.

231
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:15,844
Leave the shovel,
unless you plan to use it on me.

232
00:19:24,573 --> 00:19:28,168
When I come back,
your friend better be in the ground.

233
00:19:44,973 --> 00:19:48,204
- Myers.
- Hey. Any word on the John Doe yet?

234
00:19:48,293 --> 00:19:50,966
Time of death between
11 and midnight last night.

235
00:19:51,053 --> 00:19:54,648
Right before we were tipped on
the Palmer hit. How close are we to an ID?

236
00:19:54,733 --> 00:19:58,089
The lab are running his DNA
against all databases.

237
00:19:58,173 --> 00:20:01,404
- That's gonna take too long.
- We're going as fast as we can.

238
00:20:01,493 --> 00:20:04,451
Put Jamey on it.
We've gotta take care of this now.

239
00:20:04,533 --> 00:20:06,967
- Did you find Kim?
- No, not yet.

240
00:20:07,053 --> 00:20:09,089
- Is her friend all right?
- She will be.

241
00:20:09,173 --> 00:20:12,085
- What about Teri? How's she holding up?
- She's fine, Nina.

242
00:20:12,173 --> 00:20:14,403
What else is going on over there?

243
00:20:14,493 --> 00:20:17,849
I think I have to apologise for Jack.

244
00:20:17,933 --> 00:20:22,290
You don't have to apologise for
your husband. We're all pretty wound up.

245
00:20:22,373 --> 00:20:26,002
I think Jack's wound up
a little tighter than the rest of us.

246
00:20:26,853 --> 00:20:28,844
No argument here.

247
00:20:29,533 --> 00:20:33,526
I guess I've always kind of accepted it
as an occupational hazard.

248
00:20:33,613 --> 00:20:37,242
I thought you told me
that he sat behind a desk.

249
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:40,803
The truth is half the time
I don't know what he's doing.

250
00:20:40,893 --> 00:20:43,930
He can't tell me. It's a security thing.

251
00:20:44,013 --> 00:20:46,732
Must be tough on you.

252
00:20:46,813 --> 00:20:48,804
Sometimes.

253
00:20:49,053 --> 00:20:51,408
But you deal with it.

254
00:20:51,493 --> 00:20:54,212
Right now he's just worried about Kim.

255
00:20:54,293 --> 00:20:59,208
Yeah, well, hopefully when Janet wakes up,
she'll be able to tell us where she is.

256
00:20:59,933 --> 00:21:01,924
Yeah.

257
00:21:03,453 --> 00:21:08,004
Look, I gotta go. Call me back
as soon as you got anything.

258
00:21:21,813 --> 00:21:24,407
Walk with me for a sec.

259
00:21:27,253 --> 00:21:29,642
What is it, Jack?

260
00:21:29,733 --> 00:21:32,293
Why is there all this security here?

261
00:21:32,373 --> 00:21:34,967
Who wants to hurt Janet?

262
00:21:39,013 --> 00:21:42,164
Today someone is going
to try and kill David Palmer.

263
00:21:42,253 --> 00:21:43,447
What?

264
00:21:43,533 --> 00:21:46,570
That's why I was brought in last night.

265
00:21:46,653 --> 00:21:49,451
Well, why is Janet in danger?

266
00:21:50,093 --> 00:21:52,891
Because she was with Kim.

267
00:21:54,853 --> 00:21:57,048
Our daughter's missing.

268
00:21:57,133 --> 00:22:01,684
How do...? You're saying that relates
to an assassination attempt?

269
00:22:01,773 --> 00:22:05,368
They must know that I've been
assigned to protect Palmer.

270
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:09,131
And you think this person kidnapped Kim?

271
00:22:11,253 --> 00:22:13,972
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

272
00:22:14,053 --> 00:22:16,044
Teri.

273
00:22:16,133 --> 00:22:18,203
I'm so sorry.

274
00:22:19,093 --> 00:22:21,653
I know this is all happening because of me.

275
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:29,291
I've tried to keep a wall between my work
and my family and the wall's coming down.

276
00:22:29,373 --> 00:22:32,046
Now I don't know what to do.

277
00:22:40,413 --> 00:22:42,404
OK.

278
00:22:47,573 --> 00:22:48,767
OK.

279
00:22:49,853 --> 00:22:51,969
What do they want from you?

280
00:22:52,053 --> 00:22:54,123
- I don't know.
- What are the police doing?

281
00:22:54,213 --> 00:22:57,250
I haven't been able to call them
without risking Kim's life.

282
00:22:57,333 --> 00:23:00,325
- What if it's too late, Jack?
- It's not too late.

283
00:23:01,493 --> 00:23:05,611
Kim is OK. They took her for a reason
and that was not to hurt her.

284
00:23:05,693 --> 00:23:07,684
- OK.
- Honey.

285
00:23:14,453 --> 00:23:17,445
I promise you we are going to get her back.

286
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:23,842
I'm so sorry.

287
00:23:48,453 --> 00:23:51,843
- I need you in forensics.
- I'm about to crack the outer shell.

288
00:23:51,933 --> 00:23:54,049
You said that two hours ago.

289
00:23:54,133 --> 00:23:58,684
- This key card is our best lead on the hit.
- I'm not dropping it. I called in Milo.

290
00:23:58,773 --> 00:24:03,130
- Milo is an outside contractor.
- Which is why we can trust him.

291
00:24:03,213 --> 00:24:08,207
- I can do this. I'm as good as Milo.
- Not with this kind of thing. And I can't wait.

292
00:24:09,413 --> 00:24:11,802
Look, Jack wants you on this.

293
00:24:16,253 --> 00:24:20,041
I'll brief you on the way.
The deceased is a male Caucasian...

294
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:38,124
- Who is it?
- It's David.

295
00:24:40,733 --> 00:24:44,521
Sorry to wake you like this,
Mike, but something's come up.

296
00:24:44,613 --> 00:24:47,571
- I was hoping to keep you out of it.
- I'm your chief of staff.

297
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:51,282
- I shouldn't be kept out of anything.
- It was a private matter.

298
00:24:51,373 --> 00:24:55,082
You're running for president.
Nothing's private any more.

299
00:25:02,333 --> 00:25:06,246
- Where are you going?
- They moved Janet upstairs to the ICU.

300
00:25:06,333 --> 00:25:10,485
- She's out of Recovery?
- She's a little groggy, but she's awake.

301
00:25:10,573 --> 00:25:13,690
- Alan, that's wonderful.
- Yeah, thank you.

302
00:25:13,773 --> 00:25:15,809
Alan, I owe you an apology. I'm sorry.

303
00:25:15,893 --> 00:25:19,772
You don't need to be. I understand
exactly what you're going through.

304
00:25:22,093 --> 00:25:24,448
Excuse me.

305
00:25:24,533 --> 00:25:26,603
- Bauer.
- We found something.

306
00:25:26,693 --> 00:25:29,048
X- rays show a surgical pin
in John Doe's ankle.

307
00:25:29,133 --> 00:25:32,603
Turns out it's not standard.
Custom-made. One oaf kind.

308
00:25:32,693 --> 00:25:35,491
So we can trace it back
to the surgeon who implanted it.

309
00:25:35,573 --> 00:25:39,452
Jamey's searching the AMA database,
crosschecking it with the manufacturer.

310
00:25:39,533 --> 00:25:42,570
- Hopefully we'll have his name in an hour.
- Sooner is better.

311
00:25:42,653 --> 00:25:45,884
Call me as soon as you got something.

312
00:25:50,573 --> 00:25:54,885
The minute Maureen breaks the story,
you'll free-fall in the polls.

313
00:25:54,973 --> 00:25:57,965
Then the media'll start
churning this thing 24-7.

314
00:25:58,053 --> 00:26:00,965
They'll pick you clean,
then go to work on the bones.

315
00:26:01,053 --> 00:26:04,250
Chances are the party'll try to cut bait.

316
00:26:04,333 --> 00:26:08,804
So, I'd say you're textbook unelectable.

317
00:26:11,093 --> 00:26:15,211
- So I'm right to withdraw from the race.
- No. That's the last thing you should do.

318
00:26:15,293 --> 00:26:19,764
- You just got through telling me I can't win.
- I told you what to expect so you can.

319
00:26:19,853 --> 00:26:24,131
If we handle this right,
I think you can come back from this.

320
00:26:25,453 --> 00:26:27,444
David,

321
00:26:28,093 --> 00:26:33,121
you're the most important presidential
candidate this country's had in a long time.

322
00:26:33,213 --> 00:26:36,569
Like it or not, fair or not,
you're making history.

323
00:26:41,653 --> 00:26:44,565
My son was involved in another man's death.

324
00:26:47,253 --> 00:26:49,403
- It was an accident.
- OK.

325
00:26:49,493 --> 00:26:55,011
And what if some judge rules it was?
I mean, how do we justify the cover-up?

326
00:26:55,093 --> 00:26:57,163
All of them -

327
00:26:57,253 --> 00:27:02,281
Sherry, Keith... Nicole -
kept this from the police.

328
00:27:03,093 --> 00:27:08,406
I don't wanna seem crass, but
the important thing is, you didn't cover it up.

329
00:27:08,493 --> 00:27:10,484
You didn't know.

330
00:27:11,813 --> 00:27:14,407
What does that say about me?

331
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:24,170
Not knowing the most important
things about my family.

332
00:27:24,253 --> 00:27:27,609
I'm not saying it's not a hard sell.

333
00:27:27,693 --> 00:27:30,924
The election is still six months away.

334
00:27:33,053 --> 00:27:36,170
The voters know how to forgive.

335
00:27:37,413 --> 00:27:40,211
You just have to know how to ask for it.

336
00:27:43,253 --> 00:27:48,122
- Do you still want the job, David?
- You know I do.

337
00:27:48,573 --> 00:27:54,808
Then you need to come out with the story
yourself before Maureen Kingsley.

338
00:27:57,853 --> 00:28:00,845
Make it the first thing
you say at the breakfast.

339
00:28:09,213 --> 00:28:13,047
I just don't know how
my family's gonna feel about that.

340
00:28:13,133 --> 00:28:17,331
Find out fast, because
you can't do this without them.

341
00:28:19,573 --> 00:28:22,167
When you come clean,

342
00:28:22,773 --> 00:28:25,810
be damn sure your family's
standing next to you.

343
00:28:31,733 --> 00:28:36,363
I did a neurological exam which showed no
spinal injury. She suffered multiple fractures,

344
00:28:36,453 --> 00:28:39,286
- but nothing she can't recover from.
- What went wrong?

345
00:28:39,373 --> 00:28:43,491
When they were trying to stop the internal
bleeding, she went into cardiac arrest.

346
00:28:43,573 --> 00:28:46,963
- But she's OK now?
- The next six hours will be critical.

347
00:28:47,053 --> 00:28:50,489
- But I'm optimistic.
- Is it possible to ask her a few questions?

348
00:28:50,573 --> 00:28:53,212
- When?
- Soon as possible. Our daughter is missing.

349
00:28:53,293 --> 00:28:57,571
- Janet was the last person to see her.
- I'm not happy with her being interrogated.

350
00:28:57,653 --> 00:29:01,202
I'm just talking about asking her
one or two questions.

351
00:29:01,293 --> 00:29:04,410
I'll leave it up to her father.

352
00:29:08,253 --> 00:29:10,972
Let me go in first. Make sure she's up to it.

353
00:29:11,053 --> 00:29:13,283
Thank you.

354
00:29:25,413 --> 00:29:28,132
You know what we should do
when this is over?

355
00:29:28,213 --> 00:29:30,204
Get some sleep?

356
00:29:31,893 --> 00:29:36,205
We should take that trip we always talked
about. You know, up the coast into Canada.

357
00:29:36,293 --> 00:29:38,602
Just the three of us.

358
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:40,843
That sounds nice.

359
00:29:42,853 --> 00:29:45,208
I'm sorry. Nina's following up a lead.

360
00:29:45,293 --> 00:29:46,851
That was quick.

361
00:29:46,933 --> 00:29:50,050
Do what I tell you, Jack,
and you might see your daughter again.

362
00:29:50,133 --> 00:29:53,489
Say yes if you understand me.

363
00:29:53,573 --> 00:29:56,212
Answer me, Jack.

364
00:29:56,933 --> 00:29:58,366
Yes.

365
00:29:58,453 --> 00:30:03,322
Now smile at your wife like nothing's wrong
and move away from the doors.

366
00:30:11,493 --> 00:30:14,485
That's right. We're watching you.

367
00:30:17,973 --> 00:30:21,568
Walk away now or Kimberly
gets a bullet in her head.

368
00:30:31,693 --> 00:30:35,368
The reception's really bad. I'll be right back.

369
00:30:38,933 --> 00:30:41,811
Now continue down the hall.

370
00:30:44,813 --> 00:30:47,486
Come on, Jack. I don't have all day.

371
00:30:51,413 --> 00:30:53,608
What do you want me to do?

372
00:30:53,693 --> 00:30:56,002
Go out the north entrance.

373
00:31:03,493 --> 00:31:05,324
Left.

374
00:31:05,773 --> 00:31:08,446
Yes, I'm still watching you.

375
00:31:08,973 --> 00:31:11,726
That's it. Out the north entrance.

376
00:31:15,573 --> 00:31:19,202
- She's a tough one, your daughter.
- Yeah, tell me about it.

377
00:31:22,613 --> 00:31:25,650
- Would you rather go in alone?
- Do you mind?

378
00:31:26,813 --> 00:31:28,644
No.

379
00:31:39,733 --> 00:31:41,849
Daddy?

380
00:31:41,933 --> 00:31:43,924
Hello, Janet.

381
00:31:46,493 --> 00:31:49,803
You've had a rough night, haven't you?

382
00:31:51,413 --> 00:31:53,131
Who are you?

383
00:31:56,733 --> 00:31:59,042
Where's my father?

384
00:33:43,613 --> 00:33:47,322
- Where am I going?
- On your left is a silver Taurus.

385
00:33:50,133 --> 00:33:52,363
- I see it.
- Get in.

386
00:34:03,813 --> 00:34:08,762
- Open the glove compartment.
- First prove to me that my daughter is alive.

387
00:34:11,653 --> 00:34:14,406
- Daddy?
- Kimberly. Are you OK?

388
00:34:14,493 --> 00:34:17,371
Yeah, they haven't hurt me but I'm...

389
00:34:18,893 --> 00:34:22,852
There's a metal box inside
the glove compartment. Take it out.

390
00:34:32,733 --> 00:34:35,088
Tuck it in your ear.

391
00:34:40,533 --> 00:34:42,091
Now say something.

392
00:34:42,173 --> 00:34:46,803
- If you hurt my daughter, I will kill you.
- Good. There's a nice, clear signal.

393
00:34:48,373 --> 00:34:52,286
You won't need your phone any more.
Lose it out the window.

394
00:34:53,453 --> 00:34:55,887
Out the window, Jack.

395
00:35:05,493 --> 00:35:08,212
The keys are on the seat next to you.

396
00:35:13,413 --> 00:35:17,565
- Where do you want me to go?
- You're going to the office like everyone else.

397
00:35:17,653 --> 00:35:19,803
- CTU?
- That's where you work.

398
00:35:49,093 --> 00:35:52,324
- This is Jack Bauer. Leave a message.
- Jack, where are you?

399
00:35:52,413 --> 00:35:55,371
- Oh, God!
- Sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.

400
00:35:55,453 --> 00:35:57,648
- Where's Jack?
- He went to take a call.

401
00:35:57,733 --> 00:36:00,611
- I need to talk to him.
- Why? What did Janet say?

402
00:36:00,693 --> 00:36:03,287
- They were trying to escape.
- From whom?

403
00:36:03,373 --> 00:36:05,728
A couple of boys who got too aggressive.

404
00:36:05,813 --> 00:36:08,611
- She doesn't know if Kim got away.
- Kim would have called.

405
00:36:08,693 --> 00:36:11,730
Janet says they were being held
in a house up in Bel Air.

406
00:36:11,813 --> 00:36:14,611
- That's the address?
- We should give it to the police.

407
00:36:14,693 --> 00:36:17,287
Jack is the police.

408
00:36:19,693 --> 00:36:20,728
Oh!

409
00:36:20,813 --> 00:36:22,610
- Pick up.
- This is Jack Bauer...

410
00:36:22,693 --> 00:36:24,172
- Dammit.
- He's not answering.

411
00:36:24,253 --> 00:36:27,689
Jack, listen. It's me again.
Janet may know where Kimberly is.

412
00:36:27,773 --> 00:36:30,765
Would you please call me
as soon as you get this? OK.

413
00:36:32,853 --> 00:36:35,287
Jack?

414
00:36:35,373 --> 00:36:37,682
- Jack?
- Teri.

415
00:36:37,773 --> 00:36:40,082
He was just here.
He promised he wouldn't leave.

416
00:36:40,173 --> 00:36:42,448
Keep trying on his cell. I'll call the police.

417
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:45,093
- No, I have to get there.
- If you want, I'll take you.

418
00:36:45,173 --> 00:36:47,403
- Well, what about Janet?
- She's sleeping.

419
00:36:47,493 --> 00:36:51,486
Dr Collier says she's not in any danger
and she'll be out for a couple of hours. OK?

420
00:36:51,573 --> 00:36:53,564
OK.

421
00:36:55,333 --> 00:36:58,131
I guess I'll just call from the car.

422
00:37:48,373 --> 00:37:50,648
Go on. Move.

423
00:38:11,973 --> 00:38:14,441
I'm sorry, man.

424
00:38:21,293 --> 00:38:24,091
- We're gonna be OK.
- Maybe.

425
00:38:25,333 --> 00:38:27,722
- I just spoke to my dad.
- How?

426
00:38:27,813 --> 00:38:31,567
- Gaines put me on the phone with him.
- What does he want from your dad? Money?

427
00:38:31,653 --> 00:38:35,566
No, I'm not sure,
but I don't think it's about money.

428
00:38:35,653 --> 00:38:39,726
- My dad's gonna get us out.
- He doesn't even know where we are.

429
00:38:39,813 --> 00:38:41,804
It doesn't matter.

430
00:38:43,133 --> 00:38:45,124
He'll find us.

431
00:39:03,653 --> 00:39:05,245
What's up, Milo?

432
00:39:05,333 --> 00:39:08,211
Did you try using
an S-box inversion on that key card?

433
00:39:08,293 --> 00:39:10,727
No. Why?

434
00:39:10,813 --> 00:39:14,010
It's just... it's the fastest way
into a file that size.

435
00:39:14,933 --> 00:39:18,972
Your hunch on the AMA database paid off.
We just ID'd our John Doe.

436
00:39:49,493 --> 00:39:52,291
What happened to your wrist?
You didn't have that before.

437
00:39:52,373 --> 00:39:55,683
Yeah, I did. It happened
back at the furniture store.

438
00:39:55,773 --> 00:39:57,047
Oh.

439
00:39:57,133 --> 00:39:59,567
Maybe that's Jack.

440
00:39:59,653 --> 00:40:02,326
- Jack.
- Teri. Hi, it's Nina Myers.

441
00:40:02,973 --> 00:40:06,761
- Oh, hi, Nina.
- I have some important information for Jack.

442
00:40:06,853 --> 00:40:09,208
He's not answering his cell.
I know he's with you.

443
00:40:09,293 --> 00:40:14,208
No, he was, but he went to take a call a couple
of minutes ago. I thought it was from you.

444
00:40:14,293 --> 00:40:17,330
No, I haven't spoken to him
in almost half an hour.

445
00:40:17,413 --> 00:40:20,132
- Then you don't know where he is?
- No.

446
00:40:20,213 --> 00:40:21,646
Nina, what's going on?

447
00:40:21,733 --> 00:40:22,722
Um...

448
00:40:22,813 --> 00:40:26,488
Listen, Teri, if you hear from him first,
can you give him a message?

449
00:40:26,573 --> 00:40:28,484
Of course.

450
00:40:28,573 --> 00:40:31,167
There's a murder victim he asked me to ID.

451
00:40:31,253 --> 00:40:34,450
Tell him the murder victim's
name is Alan York.

452
00:40:37,333 --> 00:40:39,563
I'm sorry. Could you say that again, please?

453
00:40:39,653 --> 00:40:42,372
Alan York. He's an accountant
from the valley.

454
00:40:42,453 --> 00:40:45,445
I'll give the details to Jack
when I speak to him.

455
00:40:46,493 --> 00:40:48,723
Hello?

456
00:40:48,813 --> 00:40:51,407
- Yeah.
- Will you tell Jack?

457
00:40:51,493 --> 00:40:52,482
Sure.

458
00:40:52,573 --> 00:40:55,804
Thanks, and if you hear from him,
tell him to call in.

459
00:40:55,893 --> 00:40:57,884
- OK.
- Thanks.

460
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:02,209
Everything OK?

461
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:06,411
Yeah. That was just someone
from Jack's office trying to find him.
