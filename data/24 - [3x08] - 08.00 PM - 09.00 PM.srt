1
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:17,669
Just hear me out. You used up
the public's goodwill with Sherry.

2
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,230
They don't want you involved
with someone else who's not trustworthy.

3
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,993
You have got to respect
the people who voted for you.

4
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,868
Her ex-husband had his own agenda.
It won't be hard to prove he's a liar.

5
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,158
Anne, it's me, Ted. I'm up in my office.
Come up and I'll explain everything.

6
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,198
I have some documents
that'll prove your innocence.

7
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,636
- Kim, it's me. Are you alone?
- Chappelle ordered you back here.

8
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:42,395
I'm not coming back until I find your father.
I found out where Salazar is.

9
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,870
A town in northern Mexico, Las Nieves.
Jack's taking Ramón there.

10
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,191
You cannot go in there alone.
Hector's gonna have an army.

11
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,113
Promise me you're not gonna
tell anyone you talked to me.

12
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,997
Be careful.

13
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:57,516
- What are you doing?
- Your brother tried to kill me on the plane.

14
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,398
That is not what we talked about.

15
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:05,918
- My brother, I'm so glad to see you.
- What's going on? I don't understand.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,798
I'll tell you in a minute. I promise.

17
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,588
Good job, Jack.
Come, we have a lot of work to do.

18
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,030
- Where's Chappelle?
- Interrogation 820.

19
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,314
Let's go.

20
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,153
Talk to me.
Almeida, what are you doing here?

21
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,559
Get him out of the room.

22
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,914
- He's in.
- What are you talking about? Who's in?

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,830
Jack.

24
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,549
Gael and I have been working with Jack
to get him undercover with Salazar.

25
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:36,234
- That signal means he's in.
- I don't understand.

26
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,757
I'll explain everything.
Right now we gotta call the president.

27
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:51,353
So you're telling me Bauer's been playing
a game with us all this time?

28
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,839
It's no game, Ryan.

29
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,037
He's back under with the Salazars?
They trust him again?

30
00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:02,150
- That's what we're counting on, yeah.
- I'm your boss. You should've come to me.

31
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,153
You'll understand everything
once I've explained it to the president.

32
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,119
After that, if you feel I've acted
inappropriately, do what you gotta do.

33
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,272
I will. Count on it.

34
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:18,515
- The president is coming on the line.
- Thank you.

35
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:23,754
<i>-  Go ahead.
- This is Tony Almeida, director of CTU.</i>

36
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,196
<i>- Mr Almeida.
- Thank you for taking my call, Mr President.</i>

37
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,829
You're also on with my
chief of staff, Wayne Palmer.

38
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,911
I was told this is an urgent matter.

39
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,472
Yes, sir, it is. It's also fairly complex.
I'll try to keep it as clear and concise as I can.

40
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,276
Go on.

41
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,956
Everything that's happened today, from
the infected body to Salazar's prison break,

42
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,873
has been part of an elaborate sting operation.

43
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,552
Sting operation?

44
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,952
Planned and executed by Jack Bauer,
Agent Gael Ortega and myself.

45
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,598
Elaborate, Mr Almeida.

46
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:58,150
Jack Bauer wanted to fill you in
on the situation himself, sir.

47
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,515
Jack Bauer is a fugitive from the law.

48
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,593
If you'll indulge me, there's a video file you
should see. It's on a designated CTU server.

49
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:11,834
You can access the file with the pass code:
Delta-3-Delta-5-9.

50
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,752
<i>Mr President, the fact that
you are viewing this now</i>

51
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:22,674
<i>means that I have completed
the first phase of a secret operation.</i>

52
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:27,117
<i>Contrary to what you've been told, the
Salazars are not in possession of the virus.</i>

53
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,237
<i>The idea that they are
is a lie which I promoted,</i>

54
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,834
<i>in order to achieve a more important goal.</i>

55
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,957
<i>Please, sir, let me explain.</i>

56
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,032
<i>A month ago, I learned that
some Ukrainian scientists</i>

57
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,918
<i>were trying to sell a weaponized virus.</i>

58
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,992
<i>They were looking for a buyer
with cash and credibility.</i>

59
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:48,675
<i>I got their interest by suggesting
the Salazars as potential buyers.</i>

60
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:54,198
<i>If I could get the Salazars to agree, CTU
would seize the virus as the sale took place.</i>

61
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,750
<i>Our goal was to remove
the virus stockpile from the marketplace,</i>

62
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:03,312
<i>because it is, without a doubt,
the most lethal threat that we have ever faced.</i>

63
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,712
<i>But all of this hinged on me convincing
the Salazars that I had switched sides.</i>

64
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:11,713
<i>The only way to gain their trust
was to break Ramón Salazar out of prison.</i>

65
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:18,399
<i>Mr President, I'm sorry for deceiving you,
but I assure you it was a benign deception,</i>

66
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:22,473
<i>and I assume complete responsibility
for my actions.</i>

67
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,553
<i>If things went wrong, you would have been
exposed personally and politically.</i>

68
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,518
<i>This was the only way
I could see to avoid that risk.</i>

69
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,989
<i>But now it's time for you to know the truth.</i>

70
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,471
<i>I'm asking you to allow Almeida
to coordinate an interdiction with the military,</i>

71
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,917
<i>so we can take possession of this virus
and keep it from our enemies.</i>

72
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,355
<i>Thank you, Mr President.</i>

73
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,155
<i> Mr President.</i>

74
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:53,597
Keeping me in the dark on
a matter of national security is inexcusable.

75
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,037
- We were trying to protect you, sir.
- I know what you were trying to do.

76
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:03,672
It was a mistake, and you and your colleagues
will take responsibility when this is over.

77
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,354
- Yes, sir. I understand.
- Where's Bauer now?

78
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:12,549
In northern Mexico. He's setting up a meeting
between the Salazars and the Ukrainians.

79
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,756
When is this meeting to take place?

80
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:18,150
In the next few hours, sir. Mr President,

81
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,869
I'm requesting your permission
to activate the interdiction plan.

82
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,475
Under the circumstances,
I don't have a choice but to say yes.

83
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:30,156
But even if this plan works flawlessly,
you haven't heard the last of it.

84
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,032
I don't like decisions
being taken out of my hands.

85
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,112
Some decisions you wanna
keep as far away from as you can.

86
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:45,876
Not this decision. It's too important.
Bauer had no right to keep me out of the loop.

87
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:49,635
I disagree.
Bauer protected you as he should have.

88
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,712
When this is over,
you'll probably have to punish him,

89
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,430
but while you're punishing him, know this:
He did do the right thing.

90
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,749
Michelle.

91
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,549
We need an extended network
using protocol four. All right?

92
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,631
Thanks, hon.

93
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,433
I'm not so sure this is gonna
work out well for you, Almeida.

94
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:31,277
Maybe not, but right now I gotta help Jack.
I don't need you looking over my shoulder.

95
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,875
You work for me.
You don't give orders, you take them.

96
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:39,078
Yeah. Except the president put me
in charge of this particular operation.

97
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:42,072
Now, if you object, give him a call.

98
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:48,872
I may be wrong, but I got the impression he's
not in the mood for any squabbling today.

99
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,030
Ryan,

100
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,157
just let me do my job, all right?

101
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,391
I'll be watching.

102
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,718
Are you ready to listen, Ramón?

103
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,476
All right.

104
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:33,553
Tell me how the man
who betrayed us is now our friend.

105
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,108
Bauer came to me with an opportunity.

106
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,031
<i>- An opportunity?
-  Yes.</i>

107
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:42,591
To make more money
than we have ever dreamed of.

108
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,513
Bauer found out about
a virus coming on the market.

109
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,797
These men who have it,
they're from the Ukraine, scientists.

110
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:53,237
All they want to do
is to make their money and disappear.

111
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,635
How much are they asking?

112
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,597
A hundred million.

113
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:03,595
Al-Qaeda will pay us ten times as much.
North Koreans too. The buyers are lined up.

114
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,717
That's a billion dollars.

115
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,793
- How do you know this virus is real?
- The Ukrainians gave us a demonstration.

116
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,314
Bauer delivered a body to Health Services.

117
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,234
He used it to scare the Americans
into letting you go.

118
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:26,438
- The scientists, where are they now?
- They're not far from here.

119
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:32,516
I'm supposed to call their representative,
a man named Michael Amador, in the hour.

120
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,790
What's in it for you, Jack?

121
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,758
15 million dollars.

122
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:43,277
We don't like each other, but it doesn't mean
we can't do business together.

123
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,592
I need your capital,
and you need my access to the virus.

124
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,311
I would never have thought
that Jack Bauer was for sale.

125
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,709
And I am not that sure now.

126
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:02,193
My wife was killed because of my job.
My daughter's never been the same since.

127
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:07,229
This last year... Well, you know
what I went through to bring you in.

128
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:13,429
What did I get for it? A pat on the back.
In the end, a demotion. And a heroin habit.

129
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,712
I'm tired of putting my ass
on the line for nothing.

130
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,315
I'm done putting my ass
on the line for nothing.

131
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,313
If you don't want to go through with it,

132
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,880
blow him away.

133
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,793
But just remember,
you're blowing away a billion dollars.

134
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,750
Ramón, no!

135
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:52,672
- Are you crazy?
- You are crazy for trusting him.

136
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,751
- Give me the gun.
- No.

137
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,508
Who are you to refuse me?
I run our business, not you.

138
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,353
<i>If not for me, me, you wouldn't even be here.</i>

139
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,431
Like I said...

140
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,476
I have to call him within an hour.

141
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:15,314
These men are not gonna wait around.
There's too much at stake.

142
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:20,758
You can either shoot me or let me make
the call. But you better decide quickly.

143
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:41,599
Jack's transponder pinpoints him somewhere
east of Las Nieves, just south of the border.

144
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,439
Satellite photos show
that it's some sort of ranch or farm.

145
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:51,398
Our units will hold a perimeter of ten miles.

146
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:55,951
Communication is on a designated frequency.
Nobody moves unless they go through me.

147
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:59,919
Chloe, I want you and Chase
to provide tactical assistance. Where is he?

148
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,276
We're not sure. Chappelle ordered
him back over an hour ago.

149
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,114
Let me know when he gets back here.
Let me make this perfectly clear.

150
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:12,832
For the next few hours, all of our resources
are dedicated to helping Jack get this virus.

151
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,717
Any questions?

152
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,917
All right, let's get back to work.

153
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,471
Tony.

154
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,994
- I spoke to Chase.
- When?

155
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:34,436
About an hour ago.
He's not coming back to CTU.

156
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:37,637
- Chappelle gave him a direct order.
- He ignored it.

157
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,951
He still doesn't know what's going on.
None of us did.

158
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:45,750
- Chase still thinks my father was captured.
- And he thinks he's going in to rescue Jack.

159
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:49,992
Yes. He knows about Las Nieves. He's on
his way there now. Probably by plane.

160
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:53,675
- How did he find out about Las Nieves?
- He said he followed a lead.

161
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,877
Dammit, he'll blow Jack's cover
and we'll lose this virus.

162
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,916
- I know.
- Maybe I can get ahold of him.

163
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,275
Tony, you won't be able to reach him.

164
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,794
- Why not?
- He's gone dark.

165
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,670
Hector thought you might be hungry.

166
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,753
Look at you. You're pathetic.

167
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,354
You're still a junkie, aren't you?

168
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,278
It's the only real thing about you.

169
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:47,750
It makes me sick to think
that I ever believed you.

170
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:52,148
You said you'd take me away from here.
Remember?

171
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,993
Do you remember, Jack?

172
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,150
- Yes, I remember.
- Yeah.

173
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,677
There was one small thing you forgot
to mention - you were a cop.

174
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,832
Even that wouldn't matter
if you'd meant what you said to me.

175
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:10,152
- I meant everything I ever said to you.
- Do you think I am stupid?

176
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,199
You were doing a job.
My compliments, you did it very well.

177
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,790
But you know the saddest thing, Jack?
You couldn't even be true to that.

178
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:25,876
You betrayed Hector and Ramón, betrayed
me. And now you betray your own people.

179
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,879
There are times when I despise Hector,
but at least he's true to himself.

180
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:35,715
He knows who he is.
You? You're a man without a soul.

181
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,556
Does Hector know about us?

182
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:45,394
Do you think I'd be alive if he did?

183
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,948
You know where he is right now?

184
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:53,672
He's with Ramón,
deciding whether you should live or die.

185
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,230
While you sit here shaking like a leaf.

186
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:06,870
You need a fix, don't you?
There's plenty here, Jack.

187
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:11,078
Want me to get you a fix?
Is that what you want?

188
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,832
No.

189
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,717
Jack,

190
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,439
you were a man once.

191
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,229
What happened to you?

192
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,957
<i>-  I'm sending his photo to you now.
-  OK.</i>

193
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:50,114
Miguel, he's acting on his own authority.
Tell Gutierrez that he's armed and dangerous.

194
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:54,352
<i>- OK. Then I'll confirm with you.
- All right, good.</i>

195
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:50,151
My contact in Mexican Intelligence says
he can get a man to Las Nieves in 20 minutes.

196
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,391
- Agent Raphael Gutierrez.
- Won't local police be quicker?

197
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:57,598
No. If we bring them in, we might as well
tell the Salazars that Chase is on his way.

198
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,752
- What about our Delta teams?
- It'll take them over an hour.

199
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:04,549
We're analyzing the map of Las Nieves.
There's only one landing strip.

200
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:10,875
He won't use it. A landing strip's too exposed,
especially if it's the only one.

201
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:17,399
Run a topographical overlay. Find the most
likely landing area besides the airfield.

202
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,470
Yes, David?

203
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:24,996
- Have you seen or heard from Anne?
- Not for some time. Why?

204
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,275
- I can't reach her.
- Is it your health?

205
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,717
No. I'm concerned about her.
She was pretty ripped up after the debate.

206
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,360
We're all pretty ripped up here, David.

207
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:38,353
This allegation by Anne's ex-husband
is no small bump in the road.

208
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:42,956
There may be no way to defend ourselves
against Keeler's accusation

209
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,474
that Anne was involved in something illegal.

210
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:48,120
You have to do better than that, Wayne.

211
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,350
You like to deal with things head-on,

212
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:53,671
but I think the best course of action
now is to be evasive.

213
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:57,673
If the press brings this up, make it clear
you won't answer any questions.

214
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:01,833
That you're gonna wait for all the facts
to come in, as should they.

215
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,639
You may be right, but I need you to find Anne.

216
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,508
The reporters are gonna be chasing her
and she's not up to this.

217
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,672
- I'll put Perry on it.
- Thank you.

218
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,716
Hello, Anne.

219
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,109
Thanks for coming.

220
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:47,352
I just wanted to have a chance
to apologize face to face for what I did.

221
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,590
I don't know what I was thinking.

222
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:52,433
Where are the letters, Ted?

223
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,911
Right here.

224
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:10,476
For God's sakes, Anne. It's not meant for you.

225
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,193
- For whom, then?
- Just take the letters and go.

226
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,999
Ted, you're not thinking about killing yours...

227
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:20,834
- No. It's for self-defence.
- Don't lie to me.

228
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:24,515
You got what you came for. So go.
You don't need to be here for this.

229
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,716
Ted.

230
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:30,315
At least talk to someone.
I know some good doctors.

231
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,518
Phoneys who are gonna talk me out of doing
what I should've done five years ago?

232
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,397
No, thank you.

233
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,635
I'm a failure, Anne.

234
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,793
Everything I touch goes bad.
That's just the way it is.

235
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:56,034
Don't shed any tears for me,
because I don't deserve it. Just go.

236
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,833
Don't come any closer.

237
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,360
- Let me call someone.
- No!

238
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,910
You're a great woman, Anne.
Much better than I ever deserved.

239
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,516
I'm sorry I let you down,
but just get the hell outta here.

240
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,512
I said go!

241
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,160
Ted.

242
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,516
- It doesn't have to be like this.
- No? How can it be?

243
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,750
Can we be 25 again?

244
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,429
What you did was wrong,

245
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:39,114
but you made it right.

246
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:43,792
And that means something.
That means you can start again.

247
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:48,990
People do it all the time, Ted.

248
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,116
Why not you?

249
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,875
You're really something.

250
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:08,718
If I gave you a few more minutes, you might
actually be able to talk me out of doing it.

251
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,396
Ted.

252
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,951
<i>No!</i>

253
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,951
<i>- The president can expect updates.
-  When will you call?</i>

254
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,600
<i>- Every 15 minutes.
- I'll let him know.</i>

255
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:49,752
All right. We'll be in touch.

256
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,874
You should be in the hospital.

257
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:01,279
I'm fine. What have you got?

258
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,396
Briefing package on Las Nieves.

259
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:09,429
Alternate landing sites
that Chase might use instead of the airstrip.

260
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,511
Thanks.

261
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:19,950
- Is there something wrong?
- I'm just worried about you, that's all.

262
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,474
Uh-huh.

263
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,551
What is it?

264
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:28,155
- It's not the time.
- Michelle.

265
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,790
What is it?

266
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,677
This whole thing that
you've been planning with Jack.

267
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,398
Look,

268
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:44,190
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you. Jack planned it.
He wanted absolute secrecy and I agreed.

269
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:49,115
- You don't have to explain.
- No, I want to explain. Listen to me.

270
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,668
I trust you with my life.

271
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,796
But this job is what it is.

272
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,398
Jack said he came up with the plan
a month ago. Is that how long you've known?

273
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,914
Something like that. Yeah.

274
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:17,228
I just...

275
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:21,711
I had no idea that you were
hiding something from me.

276
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,949
But that's my problem.

277
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,355
I just got off the phone with CTU.

278
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:50,594
Bauer's near a place called Las Nieves.
Delta teams are scrambling now.

279
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:53,672
When does CTU expect to intercept the virus?

280
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:59,073
When Bauer gives them the signal. Almeida
says he'll update us every 15 minutes.

281
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,879
- Good.
- Wayne Palmer.

282
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,359
Yeah.

283
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,670
Yeah, hang on.

284
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,355
David, it's Anne. She says it's important.

285
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,274
<i>- Hello, Anne.
- David.</i>

286
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:17,432
It's Ted. He just committed suicide.

287
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,956
Oh, Anne. I'm so sorry. Are you all right?

288
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,955
Not really, no. I was, uh...

289
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:27,953
- I was with him when he did it.
- What were you doing there?

290
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:31,828
He asked to see me. He said he was sorry
and wanted to make things right.

291
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,990
Did you call the police?

292
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,640
- Yes. They're here now.
- What can I do to help?

293
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:41,349
There's something
Ted wanted me to give you.

294
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,919
What's that?

295
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,993
Letters exonerating me from any
connection to the falsified research data.

296
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:51,437
That's why I was here in the first place,
because he wanted to give them to me.

297
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,988
- And you have these letters?
- Yes, I do.

298
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:59,473
I'll be in the clear, and hopefully it puts
an end to the negative fallout for you as well.

299
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,710
That's secondary to your wellbeing.

300
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,069
I'll be OK. I'll come over
as soon as I'm done here.

301
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,196
Good. I'll see you then.

302
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,872
OK.

303
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,395
Is everything all right?

304
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:30,191
Ted Packard just committed suicide.
And he did it in front of Anne.

305
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:33,192
Oh, my God, David. I'm so sorry.

306
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:39,236
Listen, I don't mean to sound callous,
but what was she doing with him?

307
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:45,429
He wanted to give her letters
which apparently prove she's innocent.

308
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:51,117
- Are you serious?
- She's gonna bring them over in a little while.

309
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:55,432
I guess that's some sort of silver lining.

310
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:59,672
Listen, David, I know
I've been somewhat hard on Anne,

311
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:03,799
but she cleaned up her own mess,
and I respect that.

312
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:09,352
Maybe she's learning what it takes
to be in this game after all.

313
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:20,555
<i>-  Why do we need Bauer?
- He made contact with the Ukrainians.</i>

314
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,198
They trust him.

315
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:25,829
You trust him, too.
The man who put me in prison.

316
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:29,071
- And got you out again.
- He has an angle. Count on it.

317
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:33,517
Of course he does.
15 million dollars, it's a big angle.

318
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:37,672
You saw him. He's a shell.
There's nothing left.

319
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:41,878
No future, no family.
And a habit he can't beat.

320
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:44,520
He's not the same man who fooled us before.

321
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,955
So sure of that, huh?

322
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:50,749
We have people in the American agencies.
In their military, too.

323
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,638
Every one of them confirmed
the prison break was real.

324
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:56,792
Bauer is a fugitive from his own country.

325
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:01,078
If they hadn't wanted you alive,
they would have killed him. That's a fact.

326
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:04,914
So, if we go through with this,
what happens afterwards?

327
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,197
We just forget what Bauer did to us
and let him walk away?

328
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,794
Do you think I could forget what he did to us?

329
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:14,759
As soon as we have the virus, we kill him.

330
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:18,515
Now, that's the first thing
you've said that I like.

331
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:21,160
Bauer is clever, he'll expect it.

332
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:25,870
- What can he do? Alone, surrounded.
- Don't underestimate him.

333
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:29,077
It's me who's been underestimated, Ramón.

334
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,230
But I will earn your respect,

335
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:35,279
when we make more money in one day
than we've made in both of our lifetimes.

336
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:41,356
But you don't have all night to decide.
This man Amador is waiting for Bauer's call.

337
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,273
<i>- Bring Bauer in.
-  Right away, Ramón.</i>

338
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,358
What have you decided, Ramón?

339
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,954
I'm not sure yet.

340
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:20,349
I don't trust you, and I never will.

341
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:26,390
All I want right now is to spill your blood.
But I won't. Not yet, anyway.

342
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:32,430
Out of respect for my little brother,
I am willing to play this out a little longer.

343
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:35,432
So make your call.

344
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:39,115
Amador won't be at the number
he gave me for another 15 minutes.

345
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,156
We'll wait.

346
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,231
And you won't be sorry.

347
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:11,878
- Tony. It's Rafael from Las Nieves.
- Patch it over here.

348
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,439
<i>-  Rafael?
- I'm at the landing area now.</i>

349
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:20,798
<i>- There's no sign of any incoming craft.
- What size team do you have?</i>

350
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,236
- What team? It's just me.
- You gotta be kidding me.

351
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:29,030
This is a corrupt area. Salazar's got a lot
of influence. We don't know how far it goes.

352
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,588
Miguel wanted me to do this on my own.

353
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:35,229
You'll have your hands full.
Chase is one of our more capable agents.

354
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:37,595
<i>All right. How do you want me to approach?</i>

355
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:42,151
Don't surprise him. Make sure
he knows you're working with CTU.

356
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,714
Hang on, I hear something.

357
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:57,159
Yeah, this must be him.

358
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,834
It's a twin-engine prop on approach.

359
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,751
He's landing now.

360
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,036
<i>- You have the photo?
- Yeah.</i>

361
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:17,999
Make sure it's him. Be careful.
We'll keep this line open.

362
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,071
Good.

363
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,995
All right. I'm moving in.

364
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,436
Be careful. He's not expecting company.

365
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,471
Edmunds.

366
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,949
Edmunds. I'm here to help.

367
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,593
Edmunds.

368
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,432
<i>Edmunds!</i>

369
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,198
Edmunds.

370
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,636
Gutierrez, talk to me.

371
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,076
He's not here. The plane's empty.

372
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,151
He must have spotted you.

373
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:33,038
Stand by. I'll call you back.

374
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,395
Yeah, all right.

375
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,830
Edmunds.

376
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,114
Edmunds.

377
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,878
Edmunds.

378
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,872
Wait. Wait, wait! Take it easy.

379
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,679
- Who the hell are you?
- My name is Rafael Gutierrez.

380
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:04,150
Mexican Intelligence.
Check my pocket, my left pocket.

381
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:09,234
Get on your knees. Hands behind your head.
Interlock your fingers.

382
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:15,911
- How do you know my name?
- Your boss sent me. Tony Almeida, CTU.

383
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,595
His access code is 3-Tango-6-6-4.

384
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,991
Get up.

385
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,752
- What does he want?
- He wants you to call him.

386
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:35,154
I've got a phone right here. He says it's
a matter of life or death about Jack Bauer.

387
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,629
Gimme the phone.

388
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,911
Thank you.

389
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:51,829
Almeida.

390
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,273
<i>- Edmunds.
- Chase...</i>

391
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:57,353
<i>If you're trying to get me to come back...</i>

392
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,158
Chase!

393
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,872
Chase, what's going on?
Chase, can you hear me?

394
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,795
- Tony, are you there?
- What's going on?

395
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:20,190
The guy you sent is dead.
A sniper took him out.

396
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,189
I'm being pursued.

397
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,672
Chase!

398
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,960
<i> Chase!</i>

399
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,989
<i> Chase, can you hear me? Chase!</i>

400
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,589
- Doctor Packard.
- I'm here to see the president.

401
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,989
Follow me, ma'am.

402
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,835
Come.

403
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,959
Anne.

404
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:47,193
- How are you holding up?
- I'm OK.

405
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:52,080
Are those the letters?

406
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:08,870
This is good, David. This is very good.
This clears up everything.

407
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,632
Yes. Yes, it does.

408
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,634
Once authenticated,
we'll take 'em to the press.

409
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:17,792
You'll be off the hook and
Keeler should be hoisted up on it.

410
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:20,314
Yeah. I thought you'd be pleased.

411
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,591
Anne, listen.

412
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:31,110
I'm sorry about Ted. I really am.

413
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:39,710
And if there's anything that I can do,
anything at all, please just... let me know.

414
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,235
Thank you.

415
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,271
Excuse me.

416
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:55,875
Anne?

417
00:34:55,960 --> 00:35:02,911
I'm all right, David. I'm gonna be all right,
but... something came out of this,

418
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,991
and it was suddenly so clear to me.

419
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,832
What was clear?

420
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:12,799
I don't know how to say this,
except to just say it.

421
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,474
I think we need to end things.

422
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:25,279
After what's just happened,
after what's been happening all day,

423
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:30,115
- I can understand why you'd want time apart.
- David, it's not about time apart.

424
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:33,431
- Anne, don't...
- It's true, this day has been awful,

425
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:38,594
but it just confirmed something
that I've been feeling for a while.

426
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,560
I can't live in your world.

427
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:49,155
The things that people do to each other,
the things they have to do in order to survive,

428
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:51,470
I just... I can't...

429
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,437
That's exactly why I need you.

430
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:57,433
You need someone
who can stand beside you.

431
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:00,956
Not someone who stands back and watches,

432
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:06,831
and maybe passes judgement
on things she doesn't really understand.

433
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,789
I'm sorry.

434
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:19,476
You are the finest man I have ever known.

435
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:25,836
And Wayne, God bless him, he's just
what you need and I'm so glad you have him,

436
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,912
but it's not for me.

437
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,511
Goodbye, David.

438
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,596
Anne.

439
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:12,313
<i>- Hello?
- Michael. Jack Bauer. Can you hear me?</i>

440
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,517
I can hear you, Jack.
I'm glad you arrived safely.

441
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,591
<i>Where are you?</i>

442
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:21,389
- You know I can't tell you that.
- OK. Then where do you wanna meet?

443
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:24,995
I'll call you back.
Give me the number you're calling from.

444
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:28,834
OK. I'm on a satellite phone. One second.

445
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,430
The number's 34221.

446
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,590
- You'll hear from me soon.
- OK. Good.

447
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,712
- Have your money prepared.
- Don't worry about that.

448
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:51,589
<i>He came in by plane, just south of the town.
He was with a federal that they killed.</i>

449
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:55,992
<i>- I know this man. He's Bauer's partner.
-  Was he with anyone else?</i>

450
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:58,913
<i>- No, just the federal.
- What are you doing here?</i>

451
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,710
Shut up! If he is here, others will
be here soon. We gotta get outta here.

452
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:08,271
Tomás, make sure everything is ready.
We're moving out of here now.

453
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:12,069
- Bauer has been lying to us all along.
- I had no idea he was coming.

454
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:15,550
- You've been playing us for fools.
- You're making a mistake.

455
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:21,272
Hector, please. We can still do this deal. Don't
let your brother piss away a billion dollars.

456
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:25,239
- What if he's telling the truth?
- You keep hearing what you want to hear.

457
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:28,551
- This is an act. It's all been an act.
- How do you know?

458
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:31,234
Ramón, I swear to you, I'm not lying.

459
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,629
Please, let's do this deal.

460
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:39,397
<i>-  What the hell's going on, Jack?
- Shut up. You shouldn't have followed me.</i>

461
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:43,189
- You're with them?
- Yes, I'm with them.

462
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:52,319
- You say he's not with you?
- Yes, that's right.

463
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:57,352
Then kill him. Kill your partner.

464
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:01,400
You want me to kill him? Fine, I'll kill him.

465
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:04,677
But we would be smarter to use him
for information or as a hostage.

466
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:08,799
No more clever talk.
You keep saying you are on our side.

467
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,348
Now prove it, once and for all.

468
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,635
Fine.

469
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:28,795
You should never have come down here,
Chase. You should have listened to me.

470
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:49,152
Very good, Jack.

471
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:52,755
We'll take him with us. Bauer is right.

472
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:58,836
Let's find out what he knows. Break him
down, see if anyone came here with him.

473
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:06,829
We'll go to a safe house
and we'll wait for Amador's call.

474
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,958
- Jack?
- Shut up, Chase.

475
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:37,112
You wanna get through this, just shut up!

476
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:44,035
Dammit.

477
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:58,395
I don't know how, but the transponder
on Jack's watch just went dead.

478
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,948
- Did you try to reset?
- Yeah. Nothing.

479
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,358
Dammit!

480
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:08,309
By the time the assault teams are in position,
we'll have no idea where he is.
