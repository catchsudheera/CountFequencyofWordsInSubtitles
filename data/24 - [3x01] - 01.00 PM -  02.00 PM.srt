1
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,510
Mr President?

2
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,513
We need medical assistance! Help!

3
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,757
This is security. I need help at the ramp.

4
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,831
Clear, sir.

5
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,638
Clear.

6
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:08,232
Step over there, please.
Give 'em ID.

7
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,231
There you go.

8
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,071
Open one.

9
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,237
You OK, Jack?

10
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,959
I won't be OK until we get this thing signed.

11
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,508
That's not what I meant.

12
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,112
OK. We're all here.

13
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,670
- What kind of changes are we talking about?
- They're not deal breakers.

14
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,149
He's still gonna give up the terrorist cells.

15
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,949
He just wants to go to a class 2 detention.
Not maximum security.

16
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,553
- You're giving him it?
- Yeah.

17
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,438
My client's not happy that
you won't hold him in Florida.

18
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,796
- He's getting Minnesota.
- Give him Florida. There's no difference.

19
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,189
I let you do your jobs.
Why don't you let me do mine?

20
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,078
We don't want this thing
going south over some detail.

21
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,756
Salazar is unstable. We can't predict what'll
push his buttons. There's too much at stake.

22
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,355
I know you two spent the last year
getting Salazar and I respect that.

23
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:52,117
- But there's a protocol that I have to follow...
- Luis, come here for a second.

24
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:57,471
Putting him away is not the point. If he
doesn't talk, we've accomplished nothing.

25
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,791
I didn't lose a year of my life
to arrest some drug dealer.

26
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,396
Salazar deals with terrorist cells around the
world. Bringing them down is our objective.

27
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:09,837
I understand. But if you give Salazar
everything he asks for, he's gonna want more.

28
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:13,310
This is the deal. And he's going to take it.

29
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,632
Here.

30
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,476
You better be right.

31
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,476
Douglas. Is that my life
you're holding in your hand?

32
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,869
It's ready to be signed.

33
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,356
Are you in there, Jack?

34
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,079
<i> Forget about Bauer.</i>

35
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,833
How can I forget about
the man who put me here?

36
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,639
Pretended to be my friend.

37
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,598
I'm concerned about you, Jack.

38
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:53,629
The things you did to get me here,
I wouldn't wish on anyone.

39
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,109
Let's face it, you'll never be the same.

40
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,239
Hey. Neither will I.

41
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,832
So I guess we are in the same boat.

42
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,915
I'm about to name names, Jack.
This is a big moment for both of us.

43
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,831
That makes me happy.

44
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,437
Because, you see, we are connected now.

45
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,269
I don't know. Maybe we always have been.

46
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,477
I marked the changes.

47
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,632
I don't need to see the changes.
But I do need the pen.

48
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:33,554
Unless you want me
to sign it with my own blood.

49
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36,473
That's kind of funny - "my own blood".

50
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:41,077
Where do I sign this, Douglas?

51
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,673
Right here.

52
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,515
You have done a good job as my counsel.

53
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:53,993
Been a go-to guy, as they like to say here
in the States. But I think they're on to you.

54
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,914
And I don't think you have
what it takes to keep your mouth shut.

55
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,753
<i> What do you mean?</i>

56
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,592
Son of a bitch.

57
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,874
Open the door. Open the door!

58
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,519
Do it now!

59
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:17,793
- Get a medic in here. Now!
- This is your fault, Jack.

60
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:22,317
- And what happens next is on you, too.
- What does that mean, huh? Is that a threat?

61
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,072
- Chase!
- Son of a bitch.

62
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,594
- Back off!
- Take a walk!

63
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,629
Did you hear me?

64
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,711
Did you hear me?

65
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,028
What happens next is on you, Jack.

66
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,031
It's on you!

67
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:53,359
- Dr Macer. We isolated the body.
- You said my name was on it?

68
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,954
Yes. It's on his chest.

69
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:12,150
Run a full panel of tests to be sure, but I think
we're dealing with a pneumonic virus, type III.

70
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,313
Type III? Isn't that the virus group
your team's been doing simulations on?

71
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,470
I think that's why this was addressed to me.

72
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,597
- Has CTU been contacted yet?
- No. We've been waiting for you.

73
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,389
Go ahead and start the pulmonary tests.
I'll call Director Almeida.

74
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,430
Hey. The President arrive at SC yet?

75
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,910
Just about. We're swapping our people
now Secret Service is in place.

76
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,150
They're waiting for
your resource assessment.

77
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,549
All right, I'll call 'em.

78
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,757
- I've had it, Tony, I swear to God.
- What's the problem, Adam?

79
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,035
Chloe O'Brian does not touch my data.

80
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,669
If Field Ops wants something, she asks Jack
or talks to you, then you tell me.

81
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:52,275
- Did she damage anything?
- That's not the point.

82
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,875
My department has zero downtime
because of the procedures I put in place.

83
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,633
- Did she damage anything? Then let it go.
- No...

84
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:04,113
Jack's got his department and I got mine. But
we're all under the same roof, understood?

85
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:10,070
Good. Now, lighten up. You're gonna
drive yourself and the rest of us crazy.

86
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,759
All right. Hold on.

87
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,153
Sunny Macer from Health Services
is on the line.

88
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:23,153
- By the way, have you heard from Hertzog?
- No, not yet.

89
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:30,557
- Relax, Michelle, you're gonna get the job.
- You're not going to Langley without me.

90
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,710
Hey. What's up?

91
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,509
<i>- This is one I'm sorry to be right about.
- What are you talking about?</i>

92
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,068
Cordilla virus.
It's a type III pneumonic virus.

93
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:42,755
Remember I raised the possibility
a strain could be out there?

94
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,068
- Yeah.
- It is.

95
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,993
Someone just dropped off a dead body
infected with the virus.

96
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:51,551
These guys are serious. They blew up the
door to get our attention. This is a message.

97
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:55,076
That somebody's got the virus
and they're willing to release it?

98
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,878
Yeah, exactly.

99
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,110
Do we need to issue a quarantine advisory?

100
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,873
No. Once the host is dead it's not contagious.

101
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:06,354
Call the other county facilities,
see if there are any more cases.

102
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:10,274
- What about the ID on the John Doe?
- Send everything over. We'll work it up.

103
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,909
- It's on its way.
- All right. Thanks, Sunny.

104
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,956
What is it?

105
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:19,077
Initiate a level one setting protocol.

106
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:25,476
<i> And I don't think you have
what it takes to keep your mouth shut.</i>

107
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,710
<i> What do you mean?</i>

108
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:34,873
Salazar could have killed Shaye any time
over the last three months. Why today?

109
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:38,794
- He was cutting his deal.
- Maybe, but I don't think so.

110
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,635
<i>This is your fault, Jack.
And what happens next is on you, too.</i>

111
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,514
"What happens next."

112
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,799
<i>- CTU.
- This is Bauer. Patch me through to Almeida.</i>

113
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,074
<i>Hold on.</i>

114
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,230
<i>-  Hey.
- Is anything going on there?</i>

115
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:05,313
We just had a major protocol come in.
Possible biothreat to the city.

116
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,753
Tell me about it.

117
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:10,674
A dead body infected with the Cordilla virus
was left at Health Services.

118
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:16,357
We figure it's the first shoe dropping. We're
waiting for somebody to take responsibility.

119
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,078
- Jack?
- Yeah.

120
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,958
You thinking this is connected to Salazar?

121
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,112
I don't know. I don't know, maybe.

122
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,794
<i>- I'll get back to you.
- All right.</i>

123
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,790
- I need copies of all four images.
- Right away.

124
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,513
- Mr President.
- Wayne. Are we ready for the run-through?

125
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:28,912
Almost. The advance team dropped a ball
so we can't get in there for a few minutes.

126
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,312
- That's fine.
- No, it's not fine. I fired Judy. It was her fault.

127
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,914
She's done some good work for us,
hasn't she?

128
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:42,348
Tonight's debate is critical. She should have
had every single base covered but she didn't.

129
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,911
Mr President. How do you feel about
the debate with Senator Keeler?

130
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,319
Confident. Ready to go.

131
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,631
Sir, this is your first time back to LA
since the attempt on your life.

132
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,632
- Were you uneasy about coming back?
- Not at all.

133
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:58,555
Los Angeles is a great city. Would've been
back here sooner if events had allowed it.

134
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:03,350
What is important is that we're here now,
looking to the future.

135
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:08,639
Thank you. That's all for now. We'll have a
formal Q&A this afternoon. You'll be briefed.

136
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,794
David, we gotta talk about those GAO
members. Keeler's gonna bring it up tonight...

137
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,236
David? David, are you all right?

138
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,639
I'm fine.

139
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:26,549
- Let me call one of the resident doctors.
- No, it's all right. I'll wait for Anne.

140
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,314
- Where you going, Jack? We have to talk.
- Not now.

141
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,233
- Then when?
- Call me. Right now we gotta get to CTU.

142
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,435
Why?

143
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:50,718
Salazar killed Shaye for a reason. He picked
today to do it. We gotta find out why.

144
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,678
Fine. Let's go back in there
and put the screws on Salazar.

145
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,799
You think he's gonna talk to us after
what we just watched him do? Not a chance.

146
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,711
Come on. Let's go.

147
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,238
Jack.

148
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,788
Just call me.

149
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:20,397
All right, so what else did Almeida say
about this dead body?

150
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,078
- Jack.
- What?

151
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,799
I asked you about Tony.
What else did he say?

152
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:30,556
He said the body was dumped
at Health Services. They're trying to ID it.

153
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:36,315
You know, you never answered me before.
About how you're doing.

154
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,039
- What are you talking about?
- You know what.

155
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,037
<i>- This is Bauer.
- Jack, it's Chloe.</i>

156
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,634
<i>I have Kate Warner for you.
Should I put her through?</i>

157
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,233
Uh...

158
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,834
Yeah. Put her through.

159
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,319
<i>- Jack?
- Hi, Kate.</i>

160
00:14:55,400 --> 00:15:00,155
I just wanted to let you know I found
that leather jacket you thought you'd lost.

161
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,719
Oh. Uh...

162
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,156
<i>- OK. Great.
- So, uh, what do you want to do?</i>

163
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,595
I could bring it over. Or send it.

164
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:11,195
You don't have to do that.
I'll just send someone over to pick it up.

165
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,838
- You sure?
- Yeah.

166
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:18,070
- OK, then.
- Kate. How are you?

167
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,676
You know, it's hard.

168
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,431
<i>I miss you.</i>

169
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,511
I'm really, really sorry.

170
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,718
Don't be.

171
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,678
<i>- Take care of yourself, Kate.
- Bye.</i>

172
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,709
- How's Kate?
- She's all right.

173
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,594
- So you guys are still talking?
- No, not really.

174
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,319
All right. None of my business. Sorry.

175
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:51,157
I didn't mean it like that. She's just trying
to return a couple of things of mine, that's all.

176
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,270
Got any water?

177
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:01,152
Talk to Sunny. She was checking with
the other facilities for any more cases.

178
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,196
If there are, find out where.

179
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:06,716
Take all the regional cells
that have bioterrorist capabilities

180
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,836
and put 'em in a high-speed cache.

181
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,478
<i>OK.</i>

182
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,711
<i>Tony, it's Larry Hertzog from Langley
on line two.</i>

183
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,593
Hey, Larry.

184
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,235
Yeah, we are.

185
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,672
Uh-huh.

186
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,112
Uh-huh.

187
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,634
Yeah, I will. Thanks.

188
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:38,312
- Was that about me?
- Yeah.

189
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:43,633
He doesn't have a job for you right now.
There's no new funding till after the election.

190
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,631
I see.

191
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:53,231
Also, Larry told me that he needs
an answer from me by the end of the day.

192
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,749
They're in a hurry to fill the post.

193
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:03,598
We both know you can't pass this up.
It's a major career move.

194
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,835
Call him and tell him it's yes.

195
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,154
And you'll come along as the wife?
Without a job?

196
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,470
I'll go anywhere with you.

197
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,189
As long as I don't have to cook.

198
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:30,389
Sweetheart, if you promise not to cook,
I will take you with me anywhere.

199
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,234
But if they don't have a job for you,
I'm not interested.

200
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,359
<i>Tony. Homeland Security on line one.</i>

201
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,749
We'll talk about it later.

202
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,635
Almeida.

203
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:48,510
Pretty much. Just have to refresh
the data on my panel. Thanks.

204
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,272
- Hey, Kim.
- Yes, Michelle?

205
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,750
- You ever done a capability search?
- Couple of weeks ago, for Tony.

206
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,717
- The East European cells?
- Yes.

207
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:59,634
Good. This one's different.
It's gonna be global.

208
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,955
- Here's my access code.
- I'll get right on it.

209
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,553
Thanks.

210
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,196
Hey, Adam.
Does the link file have DES encryptions?

211
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,874
No, it's two key.

212
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:19,873
- What volume is the filter on?
- Étude seven.

213
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,520
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

214
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,238
Are you saying you had to break me?

215
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,717
<i>No, mi ángel.</i>

216
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,030
It was you who break me.

217
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,037
<i>¿ Qué más?</i>

218
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,679
<i>¿ Seguro?</i>

219
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,711
<i>Sí, señor.</i>

220
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,630
OK, it's coming up now.

221
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,756
Thanks, Chris.

222
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,877
- Adam, I'm piping this over to your system.
- What is it?

223
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,829
Frags on the body that was dropped off at
Health Services. We're doing an ID analysis.

224
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:45,799
- Where are you in the capability search?
- It's gonna be another 15 minutes.

225
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,757
- So you're open?
- What do you need?

226
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,752
Adam'll break off part of an ID.
We need a name. Give her the file.

227
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,115
- I don't need her help.
- Yes, you do.

228
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,191
This is urgent.

229
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,514
I'm ready, Adam. Send the file.

230
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,752
- I'm open, Adam. Send me the file.
- No.

231
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:13,150
- Michelle told you...
- I don't need anyone doing my work for me.

232
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:17,028
- What is your problem?
- Everyone in this place earned their job.

233
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,634
You got it cos of your dad.

234
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,718
What the hell is this?

235
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,590
<i>- Tracy, is your system locked?
- No.</i>

236
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,591
OK, thanks.

237
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,468
It could be you forgot
to set the group permission.

238
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:52,472
Someone who knows
the tree structure changed the ownership.

239
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:57,554
That wouldn't be me because I'm incompetent
and only got this job because of my dad.

240
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,312
- Change the ownership back, Kim.
- Send the data fork.

241
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,470
It's your ass. Michelle's waiting.

242
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:16,708
Fine. I'll send it. Just unlock my system.

243
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,711
No problem.

244
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:31,028
- Hey, Jack, I'll be up in a minute.
- OK.

245
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,715
Chloe. Give me what you got.

246
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,758
Are we in sync with the systems?

247
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,274
Everything Health Services sent
is in volume one.

248
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:45,956
- I've reprised all the Salazar information.
- Where are the date keys?

249
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,031
- I couldn't get those for you.
- Why not?

250
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:51,590
You'll have to talk to Tony, so he can tell
Adam and Adam can give them to me.

251
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:56,549
- You're kidding me, right?
- No. Adam's anal and he hates women.

252
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,991
Chloe.

253
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,913
Just get it for me, OK, please?

254
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,592
Close my door.

255
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,318
<i>- Yeah?
- It's Michelle.</i>

256
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,029
<i>The teleconference with Health Services
is about to start. Come down.</i>

257
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,475
No, I'm gonna stay up here.
Patch them through.

258
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,198
<i>- OK.
- Thanks.</i>

259
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:36,429
You scared me.

260
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:42,514
- What are you doing in here?
- I am refreshing a drive.

261
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:46,836
What's going on with Salazar?
Were you there when it happened?

262
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,433
Yeah.

263
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,511
Yeah, it was pretty crazy.

264
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,430
How's my dad taking it?

265
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,476
- He's OK.
- Good.

266
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:00,075
I was thinking about talking to him today.

267
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,559
Uh-huh.

268
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:05,997
- Today might not be the best day.
- Chase, no day is a good day.

269
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:10,915
We said that we would tell him if we were still
together after two months. It's almost three.

270
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,515
Why don't we just tell him
and get it over with?

271
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,797
All right.

272
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:22,597
But I'll do it. OK?

273
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,874
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

274
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,632
- Really?
- Really.

275
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:39,110
You can't put the drives there.
What I need you to do is look under...

276
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,794
- F6, right?
- Yeah. OK, thanks.

277
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,871
<i>We received results of more tests.</i>

278
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:51,191
<i>The news isn't good.
This is a weaponized strain.</i>

279
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:53,669
<i>It has been engineered to kill more rapidly.</i>

280
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,591
How rapidly?

281
00:24:55,680 --> 00:25:00,913
<i>It's a bit of a guess but, based on the autopsy,
if infection starts at T equals zero hours,</i>

282
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,958
<i>there's a noncontagious latency period
of 14 hours.</i>

283
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:10,229
<i>After 14 it presents. After 20 the host
is incapacitated. By 24 the host is dead.</i>

284
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:16,070
What are the epidemiological consequences?

285
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,674
<i>If the virus initiates at a single location,</i>

286
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:21,320
<i>there will be a couple hundred cases
by the end of day one.</i>

287
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,868
<i>By the end of day two
it could be in the thousands,</i>

288
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:27,669
<i>but from there it's easier to talk about
in percentage of population.</i>

289
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:32,038
<i>By the end of the first week, nine per cent
of Los Angeles county will be infected.</i>

290
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:35,715
Nine per cent?
That's over a million people.

291
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:40,430
<i>And those people will die
within 24 hours of infection.</i>

292
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:45,640
So tell me, if someone were gonna try to
release this virus into the general population,

293
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,438
how would they do it?

294
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,308
<i>That's the million-dollar question.
It could come from anywhere.</i>

295
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:54,915
<i>We don't know who has it.
We don't know where they plan to release it.</i>

296
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,594
<i>We don't even know what form it's in.</i>

297
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,275
<i>Kyle?</i>

298
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,111
What, Ma?

299
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:22,953
- Tim wants you to know he's at the pool.
- Thanks, Ma.

300
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:26,635
Can you take me to the doctor
later on this afternoon?

301
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:30,838
- What's Dad doing?
- On a job interview. Fingers crossed.

302
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:33,434
Fingers crossed.

303
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,949
Can Aunt Norma take you?

304
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,713
Why? What's so important
that you can't take me?

305
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,835
I mean...

306
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:44,311
It's just I got a bunch of stuff
to do today, Ma. I'm sorry.

307
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:49,718
- Fine. I'll call Norma.
- Thanks.

308
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,596
Love you, Ma.

309
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:10,470
Mr President. The country was in shock
after the attempt on your life.

310
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:13,597
But its prayers were answered
when you survived.

311
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:18,231
That said, many Americans have expressed
concern that you are not fully recovered,

312
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,993
and are not strong enough
to serve for four more years.

313
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:24,117
How would you respond
to those who make such claims?

314
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,919
I wake up every morning at 5am.

315
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,150
I spend the first hour in the weight room.

316
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,993
While I'm exercising,
I'm prepping for my meetings.

317
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:35,390
- And then I put in a 16-hour day...
- Hold on!

318
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:39,475
Could we pause the video, please?
Get ready to play it back.

319
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:44,509
Sorry, Chuck. Hold on. Don't dignify
that question with a defensive response.

320
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,350
I didn't realize that stating
the facts was being defensive.

321
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:53,150
They bring up the assassination attempt, fine.
You remind them it was your administration

322
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,674
that arrested the man
behind the attempt on your life

323
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:59,355
and exposed his organization
and put his top-tier people away.

324
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,671
All this while you were in
this so-called "weakened state".

325
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:07,551
<i>Keeler would be lucky to have a fraction
of your energy. That's what you tell 'em.</i>

326
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,915
Mr President. Go ahead, Chuck.

327
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,798
<i>And Mom called him the timid brother.</i>

328
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,908
Ah, there's my doctor. How are you?

329
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,037
<i>- Mr President.
-  All right. Let's break for a minute.</i>

330
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,076
I'm fine. How's he been?

331
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:27,631
- Seems a little tired.
- I am not tired. I'm just a little jet-lagged.

332
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,472
How's this going?

333
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:32,438
I'm definitely winning the run-through.

334
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:55,758
- 130 over 80.
- Good. This is Wayne Palmer.

335
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,400
- How tired?
- I'm fine.

336
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:03,235
- We haven't done a workup in a while...
- No. No, no, no. No tests.

337
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:06,949
You start looking for something
and you don't stop until you find it.

338
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,110
I'm fine, Anne.

339
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,599
OK.

340
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:15,879
But when you get back to DC, I want you to
have a complete physical. Doctor's orders.

341
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,951
Yes, ma'am.

342
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:21,430
Anne. I need him alone for a minute.

343
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,512
- He's all yours.
- What is it?

344
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,672
I just received a disturbing call
from Health Services.

345
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:33,392
They found a body in Los Angeles that's been
infected with a contagious and deadly virus.

346
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,199
There's concerns
it's not just a random occurrence.

347
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:39,192
- Meaning what?
- CTU is looking to the possibility

348
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,510
that this could be a criminal action.

349
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,353
Criminal action? Based on this one death?

350
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,317
I don't know the details,

351
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:50,712
but it has to do with the circumstances
under which the body was found.

352
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:53,678
- Keep your eye on this one.
- OK.

353
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:58,231
Chuck, can we go down to question seven,
about homeland security?

354
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,590
<i>- Chloe.
- Yes?</i>

355
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:10,832
<i>- Where are the transcripts of Salazar?
- I sent them to your system, in your directory.</i>

356
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:14,435
Dammit, I wanted it stored
with the rest of the files from Salazar.

357
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,875
OK. I'll do it.

358
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:25,396
Chloe, if you can't get things right
the first time, I can get someone who can.

359
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:28,472
If you wanted it with the other files
you should have said so.

360
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:32,479
- That isn't standard, so I wouldn't do it.
- Do it that way from now on, OK?

361
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:36,314
I can't read minds. You'll just
have to spell it out for me, otherwise...

362
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:39,238
Dammit, Chloe! Just do it now!

363
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,550
Fine.

364
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,988
Hey, Jack.

365
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,593
What?

366
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:06,355
- What was that all about?
- I need you to replace Chloe for me.

367
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:09,193
Replace her? She's the best analyst we got.

368
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,236
- She's not. She's slow.
- She's not slow.

369
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:14,596
She may be a little weird
but she knows her stuff.

370
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,710
You look like hell.

371
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,156
What did you just say to me?

372
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:31,792
We're on an active protocol, OK?
I need to know if you're up for it or not.

373
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,669
I like working with you, Chase.
You're a nice kid.

374
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:41,392
But don't you ever come into my office
and talk to me like that again. Understand?

375
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,710
I'm just saying you're on edge. OK?

376
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:48,191
I mean, come on, man,
you're about to fire Chloe for no reason.

377
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,629
<i>- Chloe.
- Yes?</i>

378
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,759
I'm sorry I took your head off.
We're just having a bad morning, OK?

379
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:05,274
<i>- Thanks.
- Yeah.</i>

380
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:09,073
You're happy?

381
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,871
Look, Jack. There's one more thing
I gotta talk to you about.

382
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:20,430
<i>- This is Bauer.
-  We've got something new on Salazar.</i>

383
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,556
OK, we'll be right down.

384
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,518
They got something on Salazar.

385
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:29,238
What do you wanna tell me?

386
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:31,993
Nothing. It'll hold.

387
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,832
Good.

388
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:40,878
In order to plug any possible security
breaches, we'll do date checks from now on.

389
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,349
Break your logs into eight-hour intervals.

390
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,672
Put different encryptions on each interval. If
one is breached, one won't bleed to the other.

391
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:52,470
- Did you tell him?
- No. There's a lot going on. It'll happen.

392
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:59,231
An anonymous call came in to the FBI ten
minutes ago. They're gonna stream it to us.

393
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:01,834
- Did you hear it?
- Yeah.

394
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:04,798
- OK. It's ready.
- Bring it up.

395
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:10,079
<i> You've received our package
and realized we're in possession of a type III</i>

396
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,754
<i>pulmonary immuno virus.</i>

397
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:15,400
<i>Listen very carefully to these instructions.</i>

398
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,869
<i>Our demand is very simple.</i>

399
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:23,478
<i>We want the release
of Ramón Salazar in the next six hours.</i>

400
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:29,237
<i>If you refuse to comply, the virus
will be unleashed to the general population.</i>

401
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:33,791
<i>As your experts will tell you,
you will not have time to stop its spread.</i>

402
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:37,111
<i>Details of how Ramón
is to be delivered will follow.</i>

403
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,760
- That's it.
- Do we know where the call originated?

404
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:43,594
It came out of a scrambled satellite signal.
We're trying to narrow it down.

405
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:47,434
You know Salazar better than anybody else
here. Who are we dealing with?

406
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:50,034
His brother. Hector was next in command.

407
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:52,918
He went underground
when Ramón was taken into custody.

408
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,312
Look. I know that the Salazars own multiple
properties in South America and Mexico,

409
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,311
registered under dummy corporations.

410
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:03,109
Unfortunately, the Mexican government
is saying they can't locate them.

411
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:07,193
We're gonna have to throw out a pretty large
net to trace the origin of that call.

412
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,999
- We'll work on it.
- How are we doing with the ID on the body?

413
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:13,356
- Michelle's running the DNA.
- What about prints and dental?

414
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:18,195
- No teeth, no fingertips.
- We need this ID. It's the only hook we've got.

415
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,032
What about questioning Salazar?

416
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:23,556
Complete waste of time.
This is a man without vulnerability.

417
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:28,077
He doesn't respond to interrogation or care
about a living soul, including his children.

418
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:30,515
Tony! We've a match on John Doe.

419
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:37,958
- Show us what you got.
- The dead body is a David Goss.

420
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,952
He's a street dealer in East LA,
also an informant.

421
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,271
He flipped sides so many times
DEA stopped working with him.

422
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,316
- Last known address?
- We're working on it.

423
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:51,076
We need to know who infected Goss. Work up
a list of people involved in his life this week.

424
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:54,596
- We'll pull together everything we can.
- Work it from the other side too.

425
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:58,036
Go through Salazar's network.
Find the supplier who sold to Goss.

426
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:02,398
Good work. Chase, come with me.
Let's see if anything's come in on Hector.

427
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,470
<i>Entonces, asegúrate. Que no se note nada.</i>

428
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,869
<i>Sí, señor.</i>

429
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:14,554
<i>Ponle el petrol. Ponle fuego.</i>

430
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,870
<i>Sigue, ponle el petrol.</i>

431
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,838
Why do you have my father
doing this kind of work for you?

432
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:38,753
It's not his job.

433
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,910
It is today.

434
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:00,429
Why did you kill Shaye?

435
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:08,152
Take a look around. You're in a US prison
where your ass will rot until you're executed.

436
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:12,631
You want to improve your conditions here,
you better start talking to me.

437
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:16,872
- What do you want to talk about?
- Why did you kill your attorney?

438
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,872
- I didn't want him talking to you.
- About what?

439
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,712
About anything.

440
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:32,473
It's eating at you, isn't it?

441
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:37,077
What am I up to? Come on, Luis.

442
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:41,438
You have me in chains. Two tough guys
waiting for a chance to beat me to a pulp.

443
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,511
Do it, Luis!

444
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:46,319
See if you can beat it out of me.

445
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,076
You are no fun.

446
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,557
Where are you going?

447
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,232
Claudia.

448
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,314
Claudia.

449
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,879
Claudia!

450
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,597
What's wrong?

451
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:33,513
My father is the ranch foreman.

452
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:36,592
You promised he wouldn't be involved
in your other activities.

453
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:39,638
I pay him three times over.
He can perform an extra task or two.

454
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:42,598
No, no, no. No.
I told you when we came to live here

455
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:48,038
that I didn't want him or my little brother
to be exposed to your illegal business.

456
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:52,637
You broke your word, Hector.

457
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,595
And that hurts me.

458
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,159
It hurts.

459
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,272
I'm sorry, Claudia.

460
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:07,511
- Please, I make it up to you.
- How?

461
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:11,229
I give your father some time off.
An extra month's pay.

462
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,310
That's your solution
to every problem, isn't it?

463
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,992
Money.

464
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:20,914
Claudia.

465
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,918
Claudia.

466
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,671
Claudia!

467
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,594
- Yeah?
- Have you made the call to the FBI?

468
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,591
Yes, I did.

469
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:49,432
- What about our boy?
- I'm watching him now.

470
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,988
<i>- Keep him close.
- I will.</i>

471
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:01,870
So what was it like to get knee-deep
in some fine Tijuana dell?

472
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,429
Huh?

473
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,511
- I didn't do that.
- What do you mean?

474
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:08,910
I mean I didn't go down there to get laid.

475
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,390
- But you said...
- No, I know. I know what I said.

476
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:18,271
I just didn't wanna tell you
in case something happened.

477
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,870
So, what's the big secret?

478
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,628
Remember Zach Parker from high school?

479
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:28,359
Sure. Didn't he get busted last year
for dealing coke?

480
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,668
Yeah, yeah.

481
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,069
Whatever. He set me up
with this guy down there.

482
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:36,392
- "Set you up"? How do you even know him?
- I know him, OK?

483
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:42,552
What are you into here, man?
Are you selling dope?

484
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,198
No.

485
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:49,559
- I'm not exactly selling anything...
- Then exactly what are you doing?

486
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:54,951
This guy... he paid me five grand
to bring some coke over the border.

487
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:58,874
I did that last night.
Today I drop it off, I get another five.

488
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,269
- You're outta your mind.
- It's just one time.

489
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:04,670
Getting over the border's the hard part.
That's already done.

490
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,876
Why are you doing this?

491
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:11,590
Cos my mom's on dialysis.
My dad's out of a job.

492
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:16,356
We're about to get evicted from this crappy
apartment. Is that good enough for you?

493
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:19,557
Dude, you are seriously insane.

494
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,471
Look, Tim.

495
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:26,918
I'm about to make this drop later today.
I was thinking, maybe we could go together.

496
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,070
- Forget it!
- You just wait in the car.

497
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:33,517
I go in, I make the drop, I come back out.
That's it. There's no big deal.

498
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,397
I'm not interested.

499
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:38,351
Think about it.

500
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,275
- Mr President, sir.
- Mr President, sir.

501
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:54,396
Carry on.

502
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:58,268
- When did FBI get this call?
- About 20 minutes ago.

503
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:02,194
- We don't know who we're dealing with?
- It was a scrambled voice on an open line.

504
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:06,796
All we know is what he said. They want
Salazar or they're gonna release the virus.

505
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:11,112
What's your take on this, Wayne?
Do we cancel the debate?

506
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:15,352
So far, DOD, the Pentagon and CTU
haven't recommended raising the alert level,

507
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:19,911
but they are discussing whether or not
we should stay in Los Angeles.

508
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,797
- Sir.
- Yes, Aaron?

509
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:24,189
Dr Packard's here. She's asked to see you.

510
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:27,670
- Tell her I'm busy, please.
- Yes, Mr President.

511
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,796
Aaron, wait.

512
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:32,920
- Tell her I'll speak with her.
- Yes, sir.

513
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,753
You really wanna do that right now?

514
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:38,593
Yes, Wayne, I do.

515
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:58,359
- Yes, Anne?
- I want you to start taking these.

516
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:02,513
One in the morning and one before
you go to bed. It'll help your energy.

517
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:06,195
- I told you I was fine.
- I know what you told me.

518
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:09,590
Are you gonna trust your doctor or not?

519
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:12,671
Course I am.

520
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,394
So, what's going on? You seem upset.

521
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,710
Nothing.

522
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:24,156
It's just gonna be another one of those days.

523
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:27,232
What does that mean?

524
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:29,834
I've got to get back.

525
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,478
OK.

526
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:35,839
We'll talk later.

527
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:59,113
- What is wrong with this system?
- What?

528
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,760
The grid won't come up.

529
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:06,594
That's because you need
to "control S" out of it.

530
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:09,558
You're still in Navigation.

531
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:11,358
Thank you.

532
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:21,189
Look, can you just patch it
through to my office?

533
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:30,754
<i>- What's his problem today?
- Nothing.</i>

534
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:38,313
This time line goes straight
from December to February.

535
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:42,234
- What are you trying to do, Jack?
- Same as you. Solve this problem.

536
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:45,471
That's not what I'm talking about.

537
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:49,434
Listen, Jack.

538
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:52,034
I'm gonna be honest with you.

539
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:54,076
I look up to you.

540
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:59,314
I'd take a bullet for you if I had to,
but right now I'm gonna hold the mirror up.

541
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:03,477
You were under with Salazar for six months.

542
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:06,874
I know what they did to you.

543
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:09,679
And I know what you did to yourself.

544
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:14,679
You can't make that go away overnight.

545
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:19,950
You think I didn't know?

546
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:26,518
You should mind your own business, Chase.

547
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:33,068
All I'm trying to say
is that I'm here for you.

548
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:39,790
But today is not the day to try
to prove to everybody that you're all better.

549
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:44,112
It's about to hit the fan.
You know that and I know that.

550
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:51,153
So do what you gotta do, man.

551
00:45:56,680 --> 00:46:00,798
Get your head straight so we can do our work.

552
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,355
<i>Dad, you up there?</i>

553
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:00,038
<i>Dad?</i>

554
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,319
Yeah.

555
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:05,119
<i>Can I come up?
I need to talk to you about something.</i>

556
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:06,519
Uh...

557
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:09,592
Not right now, sweetheart.
I'm in the middle of something.

558
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:12,717
<i>OK. Call me when you have a few minutes.</i>

559
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,233
OK.
