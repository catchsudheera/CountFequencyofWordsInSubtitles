1
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,112
- Marilyn.
- Jack. What happened?

2
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:20,557
My father escaped. I don't know where he is.
I want you both to go back to CTU.

3
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,713
Josh, I know there's a lot to explain,
and when this is over

4
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,190
you and I are gonna sit down
and I will talk you through what happened.

5
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,793
Thank you for saving my son.

6
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,598
He reminds me of you.

7
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,950
I told you I was sorry.

8
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:37,794
<i>(Morris) You said I should
stop helping terrorists arm nuclear bombs.</i>

9
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:40,792
We're done.

10
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,396
<i>(Cheng) I've interfaced the component.</i>

11
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,835
There's a problem.
The circuit board is damaged.

12
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:54,196
- Can you fix it?
- No, not unless I have the security override.

13
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,032
We don't have access to that information.

14
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,839
You will have to find someone
who has the necessary expertise.

15
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,919
<i>An FB-sub-circuit board
from one of the weapons</i>

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,039
<i>is now in the possession
of an agent of the Chinese government.</i>

17
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,839
<i>If you do not intercept this component,</i>

18
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:13,630
<i>my generals have instructions
to initiate an appropriate response.</i>

19
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,836
How did the Russians find out?

20
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,071
Only select people at the White House
even knew about this.

21
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,991
You're saying there's a spy?

22
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,036
Which staffer are we talking about here, Tom?

23
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,793
<i>(Lennox) Lisa Miller, sir.</i>

24
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,838
Bishop's been passing intelligence
to the Russians that he got from you.

25
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,558
I swear to you, I didn't know.

26
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,198
It's still treason.

27
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,872
You're gonna go back to your boyfriend,

28
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,191
and you're gonna make him believe
that we have the component back.

29
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,791
White House is pressuring us to find Cheng.

30
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:42,519
We have to hope we can
get some information out of her.

31
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:47,435
It'll be impossible to communicate in the near
term unless we shock her out of this state.

32
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,195
Mike. Will they let me speak to Audrey?

33
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,874
<i>(Doyle) The shrink doesn't think
it's a good idea.</i>

34
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,111
He's about to try protocol of his own
using big doses of drugs.

35
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,668
- It could kill her, Jack.
- Why did you uncuff me?

36
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,591
Cos I think you need
to do something about it.

37
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:05,998
Is there anything you can tell me to help us
find Cheng, or where they were holding you?

38
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,594
Please.

39
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,749
Jack, put your gun down.

40
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,798
Not until I get a guarantee from you
that Audrey is safe.

41
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,359
<i>(Audrey) Bloomfield.</i>

42
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,237
<i>- (Jack) What'd you say?
- Bloomfield.</i>

43
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,710
Morris, did you get that? Have Chloe
track it down. Keep Doyle in the loop.

44
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,434
Earlier I got through to Audrey.

45
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,353
I can do the same thing again.
I just need some time. Please.

46
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:27,000
Stay away from my daughter.

47
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:31,756
Everything you touch,
one way or another, ends up dead.

48
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,794
Jack.

49
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:55,477
I thought you should know
James Hellerjust left with his daughter.

50
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,315
He also reiterated to me
his demand that you stay away from her.

51
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:10,713
He'll be filing a restraining order to that effect.
I'm sorry, Jack.

52
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:16,756
The name that Audrey gave us when I was
talking to her - Bloomfield. Did it pan out?

53
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:21,914
It did. It's an old copper refining facility
in Jefferson Heights.

54
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,958
We found copper particles
on Audrey's clothing

55
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,508
so we think
that's where Cheng was holding her.

56
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:32,071
If that's his base he should have the Russian
component there so we're locking it down

57
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:35,118
- and dispatching teams now.
- Let me go with them.

58
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,034
- You're still under arrest, Jack.
- For 20 months Cheng tried to break me.

59
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,159
I know him. I know how he thinks.
I am your best chance at stopping him.

60
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:48,598
You wilfully disobeyed an order. Your actions
resulted in Cheng getting that component.

61
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:52,116
That's why I'm begging you to let me go.

62
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,794
I caused this mess. Let me clean it up.

63
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:59,635
Please. Dammit, Nadia,
you have the authority to let me do this.

64
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:03,429
This isn't about finding that component
but revenge against Cheng.

65
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:07,399
Cheng is responsible for Audrey's condition.
You're damn right.

66
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,916
I want Cheng more than anything
in the world.

67
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,991
But I gave President Palmer my word

68
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:17,596
that I would destroy that component
before I let it fall into enemy hands.

69
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,875
Please,

70
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:23,032
give me a chance to keep my word.

71
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,000
I'm sorry, Jack. I can't.

72
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:42,276
Don't even think about it, Jack. If you make
a move I will have you put in restraints.

73
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,792
Maybe I could help from here.

74
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,075
I- I could run tactical.

75
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:13,392
Division are sending over
a ranking section chief to replace me.

76
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:18,633
I promise you I will take it up with him
when he gets here.

77
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,551
OK, thanks.

78
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,834
I've a land-sat image of Bloomfield.

79
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:44,629
It's a big place.
There's Cheng's Hummer at the rear entrance.

80
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,518
- Put it over to tactical.
- It's already happening.

81
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,637
- Status update on LAPD?
- Reserve units are on their way.

82
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,359
They should have a perimeter in 20 minutes.

83
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,000
- Are you OK?
- Fine.

84
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,476
- You don't look fine.
- Chloe and I have split up.

85
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,109
- Shut up, Morris.
- Well, it's pointless being coy about it, right?

86
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:09,718
We're still doing ourjobs. We're all
professionals. If I were you, I'd stay out of it.

87
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,631
I will.

88
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,632
These are the transcripts
from Marilyn's statement.

89
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,190
<i>- (Milo) All right, thanks.
- I'll take care of it.</i>

90
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,152
Wheels are rolling in five minutes.

91
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:32,071
Listen up. Your objective is the Bloomfield
copper facility in Jefferson Heights.

92
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,597
We believe this is Cheng's safe house
and he has the component in his possession.

93
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,831
LAPD is setting up a five-block perimeter.

94
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:44,311
Yourjob is to penetrate the facility,
apprehend Cheng

95
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,994
and secure the component.

96
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:50,356
If Cheng gets out of the country
with that component

97
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:55,309
Russia will hold us responsible for providing
the Chinese access to their defence codes

98
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,392
and they'll strike back at us.

99
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,550
We need to recover that component.

100
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,551
There is no room for error.

101
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:07,509
Real-time tactical feeds and satellite recon
will be uplinked to your PDAs.

102
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,591
Any questions?

103
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,991
Good luck.

104
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,317
You're doing a good job.

105
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:27,190
- Just trying to keep the roof from caving in.
- We're putting every available agent out.

106
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:32,479
If Cheng is in that facility,
we're going to get him and the component.

107
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,551
Be careful.

108

Zhou.

110
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,155
Do you have the data?

111
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:30,953
- It's about time.
- We have to finalise our attack plan.

112
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:35,033
I want to attack the target in 15 minutes.

113
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,793
We'll be ready.

You gotta stop watching this

They're saying that 12,000 people are dead,

all because of what Dad did.

Honey, it's not that simple.

122
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,750
- The terrorists were responsible...
- But he was involved.

123
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,035
He let it happen.

124
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:29,080
- I wish I was never even born.
- Don't say that.

125
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:32,516
Why? That's how I feel.
I wish I was never part of this sick family.

You listen to me. Listen to me.

You are not your father.

128
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,752
You are not responsible for anything he did.

129
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,231
Come here.

130
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,118
I love you. I do.

- We'll go home in the morning.

Right now, I want you to close your eyes
and get some sleep.

OK? Come on. Lie down.

- That's OK.

This is a transcript of your statement.
I need you to review it.

00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,435
All right.

- Please, call me Marilyn.

140

There's something you need to know.

- It's about Audrey Raines.

142

She's still alive.

143
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,349
What?

144
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,477
<i>(phone rings)</i>

145
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,113
- Hello.
- It's me.

146
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:04,108
Hey, you. I thought I wouldn't
hear from you again till morning.

147
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,954
Sorry I left so suddenly.
We had a crisis with the Russians.

148
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,435
What kind of crisis?

149
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:14,796
It doesn't matter any more. It's been averted.

150
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,791
Well, that's good.

151
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:24,190
Anyway, I was thinking maybe we could
pick up where we left off, if you want.

00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,153
<i>(sighs)</i>

153
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,074
Well, I do, sweetheart, but isn't Daniels
gonna want you to stick around

154
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,675
so he can paw you every chance he gets?

155
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,196
I'm the last thing on his mind right now.

156
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:40,670
<i>Well, his loss. How soon can you get here?</i>

157
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,434
I'm on my way.

158
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,834
I love you.

159
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,992
I love you, too. I'll see you soon.

160
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,595
All right. That sounded, uh... genuine enough.

161
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:00,595
Now, when you go back to Mr Bishop you will
find a way to excuse yourself from the room

162
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:03,956
to allow him time to access your PDA.

163
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,311
We've uploaded memos

164
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:11,793
stating that a Chinese agent tried to smuggle
Russian technology out of the country

165
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,553
and was taken out in a military strike.

166
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,631
Do you understand?

167
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:20,718
You want the Russians to think
the component was destroyed.

168
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:25,476
That's correct. It's up to you now.
If you can feed all this convincingly to Bishop

169
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,996
he will relay it to his Russian contact
and with any luck at all,

170
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:33,835
President Suvarov will call off
his threat of military action against us,

171
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,309
at least for the time being.

172
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,995
I'm sorry. I just don't know
if I can go through with this,

173
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:45,959
if I can be with him again
and act like nothing's wrong.

174
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,031
<i>(snorts)</i>

175
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,792
Well, I'm sure you'll manage.

176
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:57,598
For the last year
you've had no problem lying to me.

177
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:05,070
Agent Hollister and I will be in a van
parked across the street from Bishop's.

178
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:10,598
We'll be monitoring everything. You do
as you're told and it should all go smoothly.

179
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:29,316
Marilyn, what are you doing here?
You should be with Josh.

180
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,914
I had to see if you were all right.

181
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,279
I'm fine. I don't think the charges will stand up
given the extenuating circumstances.

182
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,035
I meant... I meant about Audrey.

183
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,631
I'm so sorry, Jack.
I feel awful telling you she was dead.

184
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,871
- You didn't know. No one knew.
- But still...

185
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:54,389
I heard the Chinese caused her to have
some kind of psychological breakdown.

186
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,914
- Is she going to be all right?
- I don't know.

187
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,309
- What do her doctors say?
- It's out of my hands.

188
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,675
What do you mean, it's out of your hands?

189
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,355
Her father Secretary Heller
has already taken her away from here.

190
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,193
I've been ordered to stay away from her.

191
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,750
- How could he do that? You saved her life.
- Marilyn, please.

192
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,274
I don't wanna talk about this.

193
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:24,039
Ms Yassir told us that Josh and I don't need
to be in CTU custody any more.

194
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:27,749
- They'll process us out in the morning.
- Good.

195
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:31,674
I'd like to bring Josh by to see you
before we go.

196
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,672
That'll be fine.

197
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,876
Jack.

198
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:42,114
Whatever happens, when all this is over
I want you to know...

199
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:45,313
I'll be there for you.

200
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,957
Thank you.

201
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,508
Mrs Bauer.

202
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,758
Marilyn, you really should go.

203
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,956
Chloe.

204
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,917
Any word on Cheng?

205
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,310
Doyle's leading a team
to Bloomfield right now.

206
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:14,396
- Please keep me informed.
- Jack, we'll get Cheng and the component.

207
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,670
There's only one entrance point.

208
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:30,435
Yes, but that will put you
in an optimal position for a quick strike.

209
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,359
Ryan, take your team around back.

210
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,396
The rest of you, follow me.

211
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:52,351
This isn't going to be bloodless, Cheng.
People are going to die.

212
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,237
You do what you need to do.

213
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,148
Doyle's team is moving into Bloomfield now.

214
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,993
Your objective isn't to cause casualties.

215
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:23,437
Your objective is to obtain the package.
Nothing else takes precedence.

216
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,589
I understand.

217
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,509
Let's move.

218
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,715
We'll access the sewer lines from here.

219
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:07,476
Once below ground
it's roughly 180m to the target.

220
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,835
All right?

221
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,229
Let's move.

222
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,436
Don't let me down.

223
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:28,918
- Clear.
- Clear.

224
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,275
- Anything?
- No, there's nobody here.

225
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,555
But you have to see this.

226
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,916
We have empty rifle magazines,
stun grenades, C4.

227
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,991
Look. This is an arsenal.

228
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:44,868
- See if you can find anything else.
- Yes, sir.

229
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,156
<i>- (phone rings)
- O'Brian.</i>

230
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,437
<i>- (Doyle) Chloe, put Nadia on.
- Nadia, it's Doyle.</i>

231
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,431
- Go ahead, Mike.
- Cheng's not here.

232
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:04,753
Bloomfield's been evacuated. I guess they got
out before we could lock down the perimeter.

233
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,638
Check satellite feed.
Try to back-time the frames.

234
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,837
And we found a whole bunch
of empty weapon crates.

235
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,150
- What kind?
- Large-calibre rifles.

236
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,674
Military-grade C4, grenades...

237
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,752
Enough of an arsenal for a small army.

238
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:22,719
It looks like the Chinese were planning
to launch a major assault.

239
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,149
Assault on what?

240
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,951
<i>(beeping)</i>

241
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:45,831
- We're at the junction.
- Good. Head east 153m.

242
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:50,869
That will put you directly beneath
CTU and the entrance point.

243
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:11,634
Scanning these satellite images, I'm getting
a lot of dropped data fields in sector eight.

244
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,399
Chloe.

245
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:16,119
- I heard you.
- Do you know what might be causing it?

246
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,589
I'm practically blind here.

247
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:21,911
You know that patch we downloaded
from the USGS subnet?

248
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,072
It conflicts with the imaging software.
Deactivate it.

249
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,754
Thank you. That's all I needed.

250
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,870
Morris.

251
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,956
I know you're trying
to be professional about everything.

252
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:43,558
I'm sorry. I'm really having a hard time
with what happened between us.

253
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:48,233
You've nothing to apologise for, darling.

254
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,915
You broke up with me because
I said something stupid I didn't mean.

255
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,356
About me arming nukes and being a coward?
That wasn't stupid.

256
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,829
- It was the truth.
- I don't believe that.

257
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:02,710
- You were right whether you admit it or not.
- You're saying what I think doesn't matter?

258
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:08,318
No. I'm saying that I didn't break up with you
because of what you said.

259
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,392
I broke up with you because of what I did.

260
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,199
No matter how much you think you love me,

261
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:18,273
I know there'll always be that knowledge
and you won't be able to get past it.

262
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:22,956
- You're wrong.
- You know me better than anyone, right?

263
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,189
Yeah.

264
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,919
When am I ever wrong?

265
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:50,869
As soon as you're in you will create an
opportunity for Bishop to access your PDA.

266
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,996
Is something wrong?

267
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,796
- I'm frightened.
- You should be.

268
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,077
If this doesn't work
you will be facing treason charges.

269
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:03,914
- I've cooperated fully.
- Great. You can testify to that at your trial.

270
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,639
So, get a grip here.

271
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:11,874
You will do whatever is necessary to assure
Bishop nothing has changed between you.

272
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:15,157
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

273
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:19,279
- Let's get the car up here.
- The surveillance camera's all set in the bag.

274
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,351
It's all yours.

275
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:42,516
All right. Let's button things up here.

276
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,638
<i>- (phone rings)
- Yes.</i>

277
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,154
She's on her way inside, sir.

278
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:29,392
- Are you sure she can pull this off?
- Let's hope so, sir.

279
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:35,112
I appreciate what you're doing. I know this
doesn't... fall under yourjob description.

280
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,476
We're all doing some improvising today,
aren't we, sir?

281
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:43,634
We both agreed it is in our interest
to keep this circle small.

282
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,834
<i>(sighs)</i>

283
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,711
Hey.

284
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,791
Hi.

285
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,876
You OK?

286
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:28,080
<i>- Of course. Why?
- (Bishop) You seem... I don't know... tense.</i>

287
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:32,676
Oh, Mark, come on.
After everything that's happened, who isn't?

288
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,478
All right.

289
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:38,155
Well, maybe I can loosen you up.

290
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,471
<i>(laughs)</i>

291
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,995
How's that? Better?

292
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,514
Yeah.

293
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,108
You know, I'm...

294
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,589
I'm gonna freshen up first.

295
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,469
Relax.

296
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:07,438
We already had a shower, remember?

297
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,918
I'm really happy you came back.

298
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:22,472
The more time I spend away from you,
the harder it is to let you walk out the door.

299
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:27,076
I may have to strap you to the bed...
permanently.

300
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:31,870
Go on, just get out of the room.
Leave him alone with the PDA.

301
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,872
- I bet you'd like that.
- Mm.

302
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:40,238
You know, I'm sorry.
I'm just feeling really grungy.

303
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:46,917
The situation at the White House
has me stressed. I'll be right back.

304
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:51,555
I thought you said that crisis was averted.

305
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:55,068
It was.

306
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,993
Then you should feel relieved.

307
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,398
<i>Well, you know me.</i>

308
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,029
I'm always worried the next crisis
is around the corner.

309
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:09,112
I think I know how to take your mind off of it.

310
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,031
Come on.

311
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,635
Hold on.

312
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,109
We're here. Set the charges.

313
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:52,199
- Are you ready?
- Yeah. Charges have been set.

314
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,874
Stand by. Input the code.

315
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,031
It worked. We're in.

316
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:05,476
Tying us into their security system.

317
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,835
Overriding their comm.

318
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:12,118
We'll go in sectors.
Two minutes until everything is shut down.

319
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:17,115
Escape factors from Bloomfield. We analysed
every route from the facility - over 20.

320
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,270
So they could be anywhere in the city.

321
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:23,478
Morris and Chloe are back-timing
the satellite. Hopefully they'll get a fix.

322
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:27,235
- All right. Keep me posted.
- Have we heard anything from Doyle?

323
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:32,474
His team's halfway through the forensic
sweep but they haven't found anything so far.

324
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:35,552
- What?
- Never mind.

325
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:45,511
I saw the look that you gave me
when I was talking to Doyle.

326
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,591
<i>(sighs)</i>

327
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,830
I understand if your feelings
for me have changed.

328
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:55,993
- Milo...
- Yes, I... I was hurt, but...

329
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:01,759
If there's something going on
between you and Doyle, I just...

330
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,752
I want you to know that it's, uh...

331
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,790
it's OK.

332
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:13,111
Milo, to be completely honest
I don't know what I feel.

333
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,590
So much has happened today,
I haven't had a chance to...

334
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:19,877
I haven't had a chance
to think through anything.

335
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:24,317
- I just need some time to sort it all out.
- Nadia...

336
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:27,995
- Nadia, I've got something.
- What is it?

337
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:32,232
This is from about 50 minutes ago.
I've checked the frames before and after.

338
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:35,073
<i>(Milo) So they got out
before Doyle's team arrived.</i>

339
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,913
Give LAPD a description of the vehicles.

340
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,754
Chloe, see if we can figure out
where those vehicles were headed.

341
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:45,037
- Charge is set.
- All right. Clear out.

342
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,471
<i>- Doyle.
- (static)</i>

343
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:52,154
Doyle.

344
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,595
CTU to field unit Bravo. Come in.

345
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:06,550
- I can't get an outside line.
- Yeah, I can't reach Doyle. Comm's down too.

346
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,915
- Could be a hiccup in the server.
- Check it.

347
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,673
<i>- (phone rings)
- Pressman.</i>

348
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:21,079
I don't know what the hell is happening.
I can't access any of the servers.

349
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:24,232
The permissions have all been reset.

<i>(speaks Chinese)</i>

351
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:40,872
I've got a visual on the SUV and the van.
Cheng was heading south on the 110.

352
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:45,192
They exit at Florence, heading east.
That's six blocks from here.

353
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:48,397
That was security.
They just lost visual surveillance.

354
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,870
- What are you talking about?
- Every one of our security cameras.

355
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,871
They all just went out at once.

356
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,474
Chloe, Code Red emergency lockdown.

357

<i>(alarm)</i>

358

Listen. CTU is under attack.
You need to open the door now.

369
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:41,353
Base one, come in. Base one, come in.

370
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,995
Everyone on the floor!

371
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:52,998
I can hear them. They're in sector three.
They're coming this way. Let me out!

372
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:56,152
- No one's responding.
- We need to get up to the lounge.

373
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,674
There are civilians there. I need a weapon.

374
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:26,991
Cellphones! Throw them in front of you!
Head count. Check the roster.

375
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:30,959
Set up the comm unit. Filter all
communication and turn off the alarm.

376
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,719
Who's in command?

377

Who is in command?

00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:15,356
I am.

379
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,956
Milo Pressman.

- That's what they said. Yes.

Stay close. Come on.

Shut the door.

Come here. Josh, I want you to climb up here
and crawl through the air duct.

Josh, you're not leaving anyone behind. We'll
be following you. We'll be right behind you.

00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:02,110
He's out of ammo. Let's go!
Put your weapon down on the ground now!

I'm putting the weapon down.
I'm putting it down.

Both of you, get on your knees!

- We have a problem.
- What is it?

409
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,036
The boy got away.
He's inside one of the ventilation ducts.

410
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:20,715
We have the boy's mother and Jack Bauer.

Cut power to the ventilation system. Tie me
into the PA system. I wanna talk to the boy.

414
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:59,709
Cheng, the boy's escaped.
We've captured his mother and Jack Bauer.

415
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:02,917
Get the boy back.
I don't care what you have to do!

Yes.

00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,316
One of your men has been calling.

426
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:03,552
Answer him. Tell him you had a problem
with your communication system.

427
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:07,952
If you try to warn him,
I will kill everyone here,

428
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,556
starting with you.

429
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,635
Do you understand me?

430
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,791
Come on.

431
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,156
Answer it.

432
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,509
Nadia.

433
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:36,752

- We've had a problem with comm.

434
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:39,752
- What kind of problem?
- It's sorted out now.

435
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:43,719
My team hasn't picked up any leads
on Cheng. Were you able to get a visual?

436
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,075
- Not yet.
- What is taking so long?

437
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:49,311
All you had to do was reposition
satellite surveillance.

438
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:53,154
Mike, we're working as fast as we can, OK?
What else do you want me to do?

439
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:56,357
<i>When we get a visual on Cheng's vehicles
I'll let you know.</i>

What do you want with him? Who sent you?

445
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,875
You don't ask the questions.
If he makes another move, shoot him.

446
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,951
Activate the PA.

447
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:42,393
Josh, I want you to listen to me very carefully.

448
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:47,156
<i>I know you're scared and I don't blame you,
but you really don't have to be.</i>

449
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:51,438
The truth is we're not going to hurt you.
We're going to take you to a safe place.

450
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:55,308
- That's all I can tell you right now.
- Leave him alone! Josh!

451
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,198
I know you heard that, Josh.

452
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:00,316
Your mother's here with us.

453
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,994
She's OK - for now.

454
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:09,236
I don't wanna hurt her, Josh.
There's been enough bloodshed today.

455
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,754
<i>Show yourself to one of my men.</i>

456
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:15,150
If you do, nothing will happen to your mother.

457
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:18,437
If you don't, I'll shoot her.

458
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:23,713
She'll die for nothing, because one way
or another we're going to find you,

459
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:26,997
even if we have to tear this building apart.

460
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:30,675
So I'm asking you to save your mother's life.

461
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,790
I'm going to give you ten seconds.

462
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:38,829
If you don't show yourself by the time
I've finished counting, she dies.

463
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:44,031
One.

464
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,236
Two.

465
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:49,151
Three.

466
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,071
Four.

467
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:53,116
Five.

468
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,316
Six.

469
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,470
Seven.

470
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,915
Eight. Nine.

471
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:05,028
<i>- (Josh) Please, wait! Wait!
- (man) I can hear him. He's coming right now.</i>

472
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,195
Come on. Let's go.

473
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:23,913
Come on, let's go.
I got him. We're coming to you.

474
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,912
Cheng.

475
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,230
- We have the boy.
- Good work.

476
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:32,039
Bring him to me right away.

477
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,789
<i>- Put her with the others.
- (whimpers)</i>

478
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,352
- Take him with the others.
- Mom!

479
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,396
- Josh!
- Sit down!

480
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:14,836
The operation was successful.
My men have your grandson.

481
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,751
<i>- How is he?
- Under stress.</i>

482
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:19,400
A little emotional but physically unharmed.

483
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:22,995
- Is his mother alive?
- Yes. So is your son Jack.

484
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,990
- You have any trouble?
- None to speak of.

485
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:33,350
Your codes gave us full access to CTU. Have
you finished repairing the sub-circuit board?

486
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:37,319
Almost. I'll return it
when you bring me my grandson.

487
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,719
We will meet at the rendezvous point
in 20 minutes.

488
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,791
It'll be waiting.

489
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:48,233
- Call me when I can talk to the boy.
- Will do.

490
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:34,031
