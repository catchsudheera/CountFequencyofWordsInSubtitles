1
00:00:15,057 --> 00:00:19,529
CTU is being absorbed
by the Department of Homeland Security

2
00:00:19,618 --> 00:00:23,213
and Christopher Henderson
remains an open protocol.

3
00:00:23,298 --> 00:00:28,214
Ms Raines signed a statement documenting
the numerous missteps made today by CTU.

4
00:00:28,299 --> 00:00:30,051
And by you in particular.

5
00:00:30,139 --> 00:00:32,574
I don't understand. Why am I staying?

6
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:35,970
Because Ms Raines requested
that you keep your position.

7
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:40,373
I had to keep Karen from replacing you.
That's why I signed. I didn't have a choice.

8
00:00:40,461 --> 00:00:45,172
- Why were those men trying to kill you?
- David had a source inside the White House.

9
00:00:45,262 --> 00:00:48,413
- Who's this source?
- Mrs. Logan's assistant.

10
00:00:48,502 --> 00:00:51,939
I have proof about who's behind
everything that's happened today.

11
00:00:52,022 --> 00:00:55,811
Someone killed David.
And then just tried to kill me.

12
00:00:55,903 --> 00:00:57,973
- I have to go now.
- Give me what I need!

13
00:00:58,063 --> 00:01:00,498
They kidnapped my little girl.

14
00:01:01,344 --> 00:01:05,816
Evelyn. I promise you
we're gonna get your daughter back.

15
00:01:05,905 --> 00:01:09,215
I already told them I wouldn't give up
any information until I have my daughter.

16
00:01:09,305 --> 00:01:13,379
<i>We need Henderson alive.
Do not shoot to kill.</i>

17
00:01:13,466 --> 00:01:16,776
- Did you bring what we discussed?
- I have the evidence with me.

18
00:01:16,867 --> 00:01:18,937
I want my daughter.

19
00:01:20,467 --> 00:01:21,583
She's moving.

20
00:01:23,508 --> 00:01:25,738
- Give me the evidence, Evelyn.
Now.

21
00:01:27,749 --> 00:01:30,741
Wayne, I didn't get him.
If you've got a shot, take it.

22
00:01:32,789 --> 00:01:36,578
Henderson escaped in Evelyn's car.
Do you have him on satellite?

23
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:39,663
- We can't lose him.
- Evelyn's been hit.

24
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:42,026
It's not serious, but it has to be dressed.

25
00:01:42,111 --> 00:01:44,750
You got your daughter,
now tell me what I need to know.

26
00:01:44,831 --> 00:01:46,981
Who is behind this? Is it the vice president?

27
00:01:47,072 --> 00:01:49,381
The vice president has
nothing to do with this!

28
00:01:50,153 --> 00:01:52,713
<i>You promised you would control this.</i>

29
00:01:52,792 --> 00:01:55,705
I didn't count on Jack Bauer showing up, sir.

30
00:01:55,793 --> 00:01:59,309
Bauer and Palmer won't be around long
enough to tell anybody else what they know.

31
00:01:59,393 --> 00:02:01,385
<i>I will not let you down.</i>

32
00:02:03,794 --> 00:02:05,785
See that you don't.

33
00:02:14,396 --> 00:02:19,391
<i>With White House-imposed martial law
and curfew still in effect throughout the area,</i>

34
00:02:19,477 --> 00:02:24,267
<i>- all traffic is restricted to emergency vehicles.
Wayne, turn that off.</i>

35
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:29,187
OK, Evelyn, I need you to stay focused.

36
00:02:29,278 --> 00:02:32,112
The recording of the call
between Logan and Henderson

37
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:35,032
is in a safety deposit box. Which bank?

38
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,951
Which bank?

39
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,112
- City Trust and Savings in Agoura Hills.
- Where's the key?

40
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,032
My jacket pocket.

41
00:02:42,121 --> 00:02:45,557
- Mom?
- It's all right, your mom's gonna be fine.

42
00:02:45,641 --> 00:02:47,871
She's gonna be fine, OK?

43
00:02:49,362 --> 00:02:54,676
You heard what they said. We have to get off
this road. There are patrols everywhere.

44
00:02:54,763 --> 00:02:57,561
There's a motel up there on the right,
turn in there.

45
00:02:57,643 --> 00:03:00,477
- I wanna go home.
We're gonna get you home.

46
00:03:00,563 --> 00:03:02,361
We're gonna get you home.

47
00:03:10,205 --> 00:03:13,755
Wayne, can you get us a room?
I'll keep watch.

48
00:03:17,246 --> 00:03:19,477
Keep pressure on it. I'll be right back.

49
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:43,488
- Hello?
- Have you got Henderson on satellite yet?

50
00:03:43,571 --> 00:03:45,607
No. Chloe didn't reposition in time.

51
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:49,570
- Dammit. Are you still on a secure line?
- Yes. Why? What's going on?

52
00:03:49,651 --> 00:03:53,884
Evelyn didn't implicate Gardner.
She implicated President Logan.

53
00:03:53,972 --> 00:03:56,123
Oh, my God, Jack.

54
00:03:56,213 --> 00:03:57,565
Logan? Are you sure?

55
00:03:57,653 --> 00:04:01,965
She said he's responsible for everything,
starting with giving them the nerve gas.

56
00:04:02,053 --> 00:04:04,363
David Palmer found out, so they killed him.

57
00:04:04,454 --> 00:04:07,173
President Logan ordered
Palmer's assassination?

58
00:04:07,254 --> 00:04:11,008
Henderson gave the order, but Evelyn
has evidence Logan was complicit.

59
00:04:11,095 --> 00:04:12,494
What evidence?

60
00:04:12,575 --> 00:04:15,851
She recorded a call this morning
between Henderson and Logan.

61
00:04:15,936 --> 00:04:18,769
It's in a safety deposit box.
We're on our way to get it.

62
00:04:18,856 --> 00:04:21,051
Jack, the city is under martial law.

63
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:25,415
I know. Upload every military checkpoint
to my PDA so we can navigate around them.

64
00:04:25,497 --> 00:04:27,931
- All right, I'll take care of that.
- Audrey.

65
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:34,015
As soon as I have the recording, we'll have
to involve your father to present the evidence.

66
00:04:34,818 --> 00:04:37,617
All right. He's on his way back
from a summit in Japan.

67
00:04:37,699 --> 00:04:41,169
- I'll call him on the plane.
- Leave CTU before you do anything.

68
00:04:41,259 --> 00:04:44,411
- You don't think they can be trusted?
- We can't trust anyone.

69
00:04:44,501 --> 00:04:50,337
Logan has every federal agency, the military,
at his disposal, and he'll use them to stop us.

70
00:04:50,422 --> 00:04:54,381
Don't fill your father in on the particulars.
Just set up the meeting.

71
00:04:54,462 --> 00:04:58,342
- I'll call back when I have the recording.
- I'll upload those checkpoints.

72
00:04:59,463 --> 00:05:01,772
Wayne.

73
00:05:01,863 --> 00:05:04,503
That's the bank manager's address -
he's not far.

74
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:06,654
Good. Let's get them in the room.

75
00:05:09,784 --> 00:05:12,663
Hey. We need to get inside now.

76
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:16,499
- Come on, it's OK.
- Just try to stand up.

77
00:05:23,587 --> 00:05:26,055
I need you to sit right here, OK?

78
00:05:27,187 --> 00:05:29,986
OK. Lay down here on the bed.

79
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:41,102
I'm sorry, but it's not safe to take you
to a hospital yet. Let me see. Let me see.

80
00:05:44,749 --> 00:05:47,344
Wayne, take Amy outside for a second.

81
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:50,305
Come on, sweetie.

82
00:05:57,231 --> 00:06:01,111
OK. Even though the bullet went through,
I still have to clean this wound.

83
00:06:01,193 --> 00:06:04,902
It's gonna hurt, but I promise
I'll get you to a hospital as soon as I can.

84
00:06:04,993 --> 00:06:08,873
- In the meantime, Wayne will look after you.
- No, I'll be fine.

85
00:06:08,954 --> 00:06:12,264
You need to get the evidence.
I don't need help.

86
00:06:12,354 --> 00:06:14,823
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

87
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,945
OK.

88
00:06:18,035 --> 00:06:20,425
Put pressure on it.

89
00:06:26,476 --> 00:06:30,187
- Sweetheart, you can see your mom now.
- Go ahead.

90
00:06:31,478 --> 00:06:34,595
Give me the car keys. Let's go.

91
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:41,153
<i>- I haven't picked up Bauer's trail yet.
- So he got away.</i>

92
00:06:41,239 --> 00:06:45,756
And there's nothing to stop him and Wayne
from going to the media with all they know.

93
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,877
Jack knows there's no point
going public until he has proof.

94
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,351
He won't make accusations
until he has that evidence in his hand.

95
00:06:52,441 --> 00:06:57,072
This evidence, this recording
that Evelyn made of our conversation,

96
00:06:57,162 --> 00:06:59,995
are you any closer to finding
where she's hidden it?

97
00:07:00,082 --> 00:07:02,881
<i>No, not yet,
but she was wounded and I will find her.</i>

98
00:07:02,962 --> 00:07:06,876
We're monitoring hospitals.
This is containable, I promise you.

99
00:07:06,963 --> 00:07:09,842
Please, spare me your promises,
Mr. Henderson.

100
00:07:09,924 --> 00:07:15,044
It's all gone wrong. None of this
should have happened. All these killings.

101
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:19,482
This whole thing was planned
to make our country safer, stronger,

102
00:07:19,565 --> 00:07:22,398
to protect our interests.

103
00:07:22,486 --> 00:07:27,163
And it all spiralled out of control
when you decided to kill David Palmer.

104
00:07:27,246 --> 00:07:29,283
Mr. President, what's done is done.

105
00:07:29,367 --> 00:07:33,406
Right now, we have to focus on stopping
Bauer before he finds that recording.

106
00:07:33,488 --> 00:07:36,958
<i>No. You have to focus on it.</i>

107
00:07:40,649 --> 00:07:45,007
- Haven't the analysts finished the hourlies?
- They're still getting up to speed.

108
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:47,364
We knew this wouldn't be seamless.

109
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:50,283
Sometimes I wonder if it was even necessary.

110
00:07:51,731 --> 00:07:55,849
Karen, CTU's performance today
has been considerably less than stellar.

111
00:07:55,931 --> 00:08:00,210
Dozens have been killed, and they couldn't
even prevent an attack on themselves.

112
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:05,491
Do you believe, under the circumstances,
that we could have done any better?

113
00:08:05,573 --> 00:08:08,565
Ms Hayes. The president's on line one.

114
00:08:08,653 --> 00:08:11,486
Put him through to Buchanan's office.
I'll work there.

115
00:08:11,573 --> 00:08:17,171
Have Medical notify me as soon as Bierko
has regained consciousness. Miles.

116
00:08:30,417 --> 00:08:35,048
- Yes, Mr. President?
- Karen, do you know where Jack Bauer is?

117
00:08:35,137 --> 00:08:39,290
Not at the moment. He was due back 30
minutes ago to lead the Bierko interrogation.

118
00:08:39,379 --> 00:08:42,974
- He's gone off-grid.
- I'm not surprised.

119
00:08:43,059 --> 00:08:47,975
Karen, I'm issuing an executive order for the
immediate apprehension and arrest of Bauer.

120
00:08:48,059 --> 00:08:54,375
I want you to run point on this, and
I want you to make this CTU's top priority.

121
00:08:54,461 --> 00:08:59,979
Yes, sir. For purposes of the warrant, I'll need
to know what Bauer's being charged with.

122
00:09:00,062 --> 00:09:02,530
His role in the assassination of David Palmer.

123
00:09:02,622 --> 00:09:07,332
But I understood he'd been exonerated
of that charge. You reinstated his credentials.

124
00:09:07,423 --> 00:09:12,100
I know, but I didn't have all the facts then.
Some new evidence has come to light.

125
00:09:12,183 --> 00:09:16,575
- New evidence?
- Yes. I'm looking at it right now.

126
00:09:16,664 --> 00:09:19,975
And I will forward it to you
at the appropriate time.

127
00:09:20,065 --> 00:09:22,420
- Yes, sir.
- Karen.

128
00:09:23,425 --> 00:09:25,781
Obviously this is a very sensitive matter.

129
00:09:25,866 --> 00:09:29,779
For now, I'd like you to treat
the origin of this warrant as confidential.

130
00:09:29,866 --> 00:09:32,505
- Understood, sir.
- Good.

131
00:09:36,227 --> 00:09:40,665
Put out an alert on Jack Bauer to all
federal law-enforcement agencies and NSA.

132
00:09:40,748 --> 00:09:44,059
I'll also tell Military.
They have more men on the street.

133
00:09:44,148 --> 00:09:46,265
I don't like this.

134
00:09:46,349 --> 00:09:50,865
Pulling our resources off Henderson to go
after Jack without knowing the evidence?

135
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:53,908
It's a direct order from the president.

136
00:09:55,631 --> 00:09:57,825
If we really want to find Bauer,

137
00:09:57,911 --> 00:10:01,700
we need to keep watch on
anyone he might contact for help,

138
00:10:01,792 --> 00:10:03,987
starting with Audrey Raines.

139
00:10:11,753 --> 00:10:16,305
- What's this?
- Make it look like we're talking about it.

140
00:10:16,393 --> 00:10:18,032
OK.

141
00:10:18,594 --> 00:10:21,870
Can you get me a secure channel
so my calls can't be monitored?

142
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:25,186
Using a VPN pathway, sure.
It takes about an hour to crack.

143
00:10:25,276 --> 00:10:27,949
- Why, what's going on?
- I just spoke with Jack.

144
00:10:28,035 --> 00:10:32,552
Gardner isn't the one who's behind this.
It's President Logan.

145
00:10:32,636 --> 00:10:34,194
What?

146
00:10:34,277 --> 00:10:36,745
Jack is getting proof. I'm leaving to help him.

147
00:10:36,837 --> 00:10:39,068
Take a CTU walkie.

148
00:10:39,157 --> 00:10:40,477
Audrey.

149
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:43,277
It's a warrant for Jack's arrest.

150
00:10:43,358 --> 00:10:45,634
- It's starting.
- What do we do?

151
00:10:45,719 --> 00:10:47,868
Heading out?

152
00:10:47,959 --> 00:10:50,268
Yes, I'm gonna try to grab some sleep.

153
00:10:50,359 --> 00:10:54,273
- I came to talk to you about the warrant.
- Start with why it was issued.

154
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:58,239
There's new evidence implicating Jack
in David Palmer's assassination.

155
00:10:58,321 --> 00:11:01,916
That's ridiculous.
The assassin confessed. Check the logs.

156
00:11:02,001 --> 00:11:05,074
I know about the logs, Chloe.
My orders are to bring Jack in.

157
00:11:05,162 --> 00:11:08,438
New evidence? Have you seen it?

158
00:11:09,362 --> 00:11:12,161
- It's forthcoming.
- Who ordered this, Karen?

159
00:11:12,243 --> 00:11:15,600
I can't discuss that.
When was the last time you spoke with Jack?

160
00:11:15,683 --> 00:11:18,835
About an hour ago.
We haven't had contact since.

161
00:11:18,924 --> 00:11:24,158
I don't have to remind you that you have an
obligation to notify me if Jack contacts you.

162
00:11:24,245 --> 00:11:29,194
Look, I know this may seem odd
to the both of you. Frankly, it does to me.

163
00:11:29,286 --> 00:11:34,201
But let's remember it's in everyone's
best interests to bring Jack in peacefully.

164
00:11:34,287 --> 00:11:36,357
Have a good night.

165
00:11:36,447 --> 00:11:38,438
Thank you.

166
00:11:45,928 --> 00:11:49,762
<i>- Harris.
- Audrey's on her way. What's your status?</i>

167
00:11:49,849 --> 00:11:54,082
<i>- We're placing the transponder on her car.
- Good.</i>

168
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:57,162
There won't be many cars.
Use the tracker and stay out of sight.

169
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,127
Will do.

170
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:02,887
We don't want anything to stop Audrey
from leading us to Bauer.

171
00:12:19,974 --> 00:12:22,329
- That's the house.
- OK.

172
00:12:22,975 --> 00:12:27,048
- What's the bank manager's name?
- Carl Mossman.

173
00:12:31,135 --> 00:12:35,448
- You got your gun?
- Yeah, but we don't need one for this, do we?

174
00:12:35,536 --> 00:12:38,608
He won't let us into his bank
unless he thinks he has to.

175
00:12:38,697 --> 00:12:41,973
- Why don't we just tell him the truth?
- Would you believe it?

176
00:12:42,058 --> 00:12:44,935
The only way we'll have compliance
is if he's scared.

177
00:12:45,018 --> 00:12:49,297
If you're uncomfortable with that,
you should stay here.

178
00:13:25,624 --> 00:13:28,298
They've got a magnetic alarm.

179
00:13:45,187 --> 00:13:47,383
We're in.

180
00:13:47,468 --> 00:13:52,588
<i>...within the hour, President Logan plans
to make a statement to the American people</i>

181
00:13:52,669 --> 00:13:58,222
<i>about the successful resolution of today's
terrorist threat. As of now, however...</i>

182
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:01,780
- Did you hear something?
- Like what?

183
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:05,141
I don't know.

184
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:08,861
- Carl?
- Hang on.

185
00:14:10,632 --> 00:14:13,100
- Carl!
- I'll be right back.

186
00:14:19,913 --> 00:14:22,667
Don't you move!

187
00:14:22,754 --> 00:14:24,472
Rose, call...

188
00:14:25,634 --> 00:14:27,067
Cover him.

189
00:14:28,515 --> 00:14:32,394
Put the phone down.
Put the phone down now!

190
00:14:32,475 --> 00:14:36,788
Bring him in here!
Just stay calm and everything will be fine.

191
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,071
Let's go!

192
00:14:39,836 --> 00:14:42,829
- Oh, my God! Carl!
- Take a seat on the bed.

193
00:14:42,917 --> 00:14:46,388
Hey, look. Our money and jewellery's
in a floor safe in the closet.

194
00:14:46,478 --> 00:14:51,108
We're not interested in that.
You're gonna get us into your bank.

195
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:54,597
I can't do that.

196
00:14:54,679 --> 00:14:59,673
It's not that I won't. I can't. The alarm system
will only allow entry during business hours.

197
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:05,472
Don't lie to me. Every bank has procedures
to allow access during an emergency.

198
00:15:06,201 --> 00:15:10,114
Hey! No, no! I'll take you to the bank.

199
00:15:12,682 --> 00:15:14,718
Slowly, get up and get dressed.

200
00:15:14,802 --> 00:15:18,317
Carl!
- It's all right, it's all right, it's all right.

201
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:23,471
I want four of your neckties.

202
00:15:28,684 --> 00:15:32,803
Tie her up to the chair. Ankles and wrists.
Make sure she doesn't move.

203
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:35,162
All right, go ahead.

204
00:15:36,966 --> 00:15:39,115
She's got clearance.

205
00:15:41,767 --> 00:15:43,119
Come on.

206
00:15:43,206 --> 00:15:46,085
Hi. I need to speak
with Secretary Heller, please.

207
00:15:53,088 --> 00:15:59,085
Mr. Secretary, there's a call coming in for you
on an encrypted channel. It's your daughter.

208
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:02,806
- Audrey, is everything OK?
- Hi.

209
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:04,881
Yes, I'm OK.

210
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:08,929
- Dad, I need your help. Is this a secure line?
- Very secure.

211
00:16:09,011 --> 00:16:12,686
Is this about the arrest order for Jack?
I was just informed.

212
00:16:12,772 --> 00:16:16,367
I can't go into details now,
but Jack is innocent. He's being set up.

213
00:16:16,452 --> 00:16:18,920
Set up by whom?

214
00:16:19,893 --> 00:16:24,921
What the hell is going on, Audrey? You call
me this morning to tell me that Jack's alive.

215
00:16:25,013 --> 00:16:28,609
Now I get word he's a suspect again
in the Palmer assassination.

216
00:16:28,693 --> 00:16:32,165
I can't talk to you about it right now.
I need to see you in person.

217
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:35,053
Can you reroute your plane to Los Angeles?

218
00:16:35,135 --> 00:16:40,927
Dad, I would never ask you to do this
if it wasn't extremely important.

219
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:47,694
- All right, yes.
- Thank you. The closest airport is Van Nuys.

220
00:16:51,818 --> 00:16:54,890
We're about an hour out.
I'll call you on final approach.

221
00:16:54,978 --> 00:16:57,618
<i>- OK, thank you. I'll see you there.
- I'll see you.</i>

222
00:16:57,698 --> 00:16:59,496
Bye.

223
00:17:01,499 --> 00:17:03,091
Doug!

224
00:17:05,739 --> 00:17:07,219
Yes, sir?

225
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:12,294
We have to make a stop in LA,
and keep it off the manifest.

226
00:17:12,381 --> 00:17:14,258
Yes, sir.

227
00:17:28,344 --> 00:17:30,619
Pull over. She's stopped.

228
00:17:31,624 --> 00:17:33,979
The corner of Elderton and Davis.

229
00:17:36,145 --> 00:17:37,897
It's a gas station.

230
00:17:37,985 --> 00:17:39,941
<i>- O'Brian.
- Chloe, it's me.</i>

231
00:17:40,026 --> 00:17:42,586
Hold on.

232
00:17:42,665 --> 00:17:46,944
I switched to my VPN. They can't monitor
the conversation. Do you have the walkie?

233
00:17:47,026 --> 00:17:49,495
Yeah, hang on.

234
00:17:49,587 --> 00:17:53,501
- All right, what do I do with it?
- Tune to proprietary channel 17.

235
00:17:53,588 --> 00:17:56,660
Turn sensitivity up all the way
to pick up a pilot signal.

236
00:17:56,748 --> 00:17:58,740
OK, hold on.

237
00:18:02,349 --> 00:18:07,060
- Wow. Do you hear that?
- It's what I figured. They put a tracker on you.

238
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:11,628
I found it. All right, Chloe, I got it. Thank you.

239
00:18:11,711 --> 00:18:14,783
You need to disable your phone
by taking the battery out.

240
00:18:14,871 --> 00:18:18,420
I have to wait for a call from Jack,
and then I will.

241
00:18:56,438 --> 00:18:58,906
- Yes?
- Sir.

242
00:18:58,998 --> 00:19:00,989
It's almost time.

243
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:05,311
Yes, the press conference. That's right.

244
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:08,759
Mr. President, if I could have a moment?

245
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:13,755
- I'll be done with my statement shortly...
- This is potentially time-sensitive, sir.

246
00:19:13,841 --> 00:19:17,960
I just got an alert that a warrant
has been issued for Jack Bauer.

247
00:19:19,001 --> 00:19:21,596
Thank you, Aaron.

248
00:19:21,681 --> 00:19:23,513
Yes, sir.

249
00:19:27,563 --> 00:19:30,795
- What about the warrant?
- It's an executive branch warrant.

250
00:19:30,883 --> 00:19:33,114
I didn't issue it, so it must have been you.

251
00:19:33,204 --> 00:19:35,115
That's right, it came from me.

252
00:19:35,204 --> 00:19:39,356
As you put me in charge of overseeing CTU
and the Homeland Security transfer,

253
00:19:39,445 --> 00:19:42,562
don't you think you should have
discussed it with me first?

254
00:19:42,645 --> 00:19:48,596
I appreciate everything you've done, but last
time I checked, I was still commander in chief.

255
00:19:48,686 --> 00:19:51,565
Of course, Mr. President, but Jack Bauer?

256
00:19:51,646 --> 00:19:55,765
It doesn't make any sense.
We should be treating that man like a hero.

257
00:19:55,847 --> 00:20:01,206
I've gone over it. Cummings confessed that
he arranged the assassination, framing Bauer.

258
00:20:01,288 --> 00:20:04,804
Well, clearly Cummings
was protecting Bauer.

259
00:20:04,889 --> 00:20:07,323
- Why?
- I don't know why.

260
00:20:07,409 --> 00:20:11,085
The fact remains I received confirmation
from intelligence sources

261
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:13,809
that Bauer was, without question, the shooter.

262
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:15,767
- Which sources?
- That's enough.

263
00:20:15,851 --> 00:20:19,605
I'm not gonna stand here
and have my orders challenged.

264
00:20:19,691 --> 00:20:25,608
You have concerns, Hal. We will
sort this all out once Bauer's in custody.

265
00:20:25,692 --> 00:20:28,002
Does that suit you?

266
00:20:28,092 --> 00:20:30,323
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

267
00:20:34,374 --> 00:20:36,365
Mom?

268
00:21:13,779 --> 00:21:16,135
Amy?

269
00:21:16,221 --> 00:21:18,370
I'm coming.

270
00:21:23,622 --> 00:21:25,897
Sweetheart? Ow!

271
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:42,102
Mom!

272
00:21:44,504 --> 00:21:46,496
Mom.

273
00:21:53,706 --> 00:21:58,986
<i>- 911. What's your emergency?
- My mom passed out. I can't wake her up.</i>

274
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:03,300
<i>- Calm down. Tell me, what's your name?
- Amy. My mom's name is Evelyn.</i>

275
00:22:03,388 --> 00:22:07,701
<i>- And what's your mom's last name?
- Martin. Her name's Evelyn Martin.</i>

276
00:22:07,789 --> 00:22:10,428
<i>All right, honey, now tell me where you are.</i>

277
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:15,543
Yeah.

278
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:22,150
<i>Sir, a call is coming to the 911 operator
from a motel at 1850 Porter Valley Drive,</i>

279
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:25,268
<i>requesting assistance for an Evelyn Martin.</i>

280
00:22:25,352 --> 00:22:27,820
I'll be there shortly.

281
00:22:41,226 --> 00:22:44,105
My fellow Americans, it is with great relief

282
00:22:44,186 --> 00:22:49,308
that I announce that the terrorist threat
our nation faced today is over.

283
00:22:49,387 --> 00:22:53,301
More than an hour ago,
counterterrorist agents, under my direction,

284
00:22:53,388 --> 00:22:55,983
thwarted the latest attack on civilians,

285
00:22:56,069 --> 00:23:00,143
the nature of which was kept secret
due to national security.

286
00:23:00,229 --> 00:23:03,939
This was done
with the public's best interest in mind.

287
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:06,750
- He really did it.
- Ma'am?

288
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:09,462
Charles.

289
00:23:10,471 --> 00:23:14,431
He stopped the terrorists,
the treaty was signed.

290
00:23:14,511 --> 00:23:18,790
He said he would ride out this crisis
and everything would be OK.

291
00:23:18,872 --> 00:23:21,306
And it is.

292
00:23:21,393 --> 00:23:23,907
I should have trusted him.

293
00:23:23,993 --> 00:23:25,426
Yes, ma'am.

294
00:23:26,754 --> 00:23:29,348
What's wrong, Aaron?

295
00:23:29,434 --> 00:23:31,629
I'm just a little battle-worn.

296
00:23:48,597 --> 00:23:52,273
- Why are we stopping here?
- There's too many checkpoints in the area.

297
00:23:52,357 --> 00:23:55,316
- We'll go the rest of the way on foot.
- How far's the bank?

298
00:23:55,398 --> 00:23:58,277
About a quarter of a mile that way.

299
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:04,151
I'll be right back.

300
00:24:09,321 --> 00:24:11,039
<i>- Aaron, it's Jack.
- Jack.</i>

301
00:24:11,121 --> 00:24:15,877
Are you aware Logan's issued a warrant
for your arrest for Palmer's assassination?

302
00:24:15,961 --> 00:24:20,194
- No, but that makes sense.
- The vice president's not behind this, is he?

303
00:24:20,282 --> 00:24:22,877
No, it's Logan.

304
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:27,434
They'll have every agency looking for you.
Logan is the only one who can call them off.

305
00:24:27,523 --> 00:24:32,359
As soon as we have the evidence, we'll pass it
off to Secretary Heller. Then it won't matter.

306
00:24:32,444 --> 00:24:36,233
- Is there anything I can do?
- Keep your eyes open and watch your back.

307
00:24:36,325 --> 00:24:37,838
Will do.

308
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:44,319
Get out of the car. Come on.

309
00:24:46,207 --> 00:24:48,357
Let's go.

310
00:24:52,447 --> 00:24:54,120
Move, move.

311
00:24:59,409 --> 00:25:01,400
Take cover. Go!

312
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:10,369
Not a word.

313
00:25:18,211 --> 00:25:23,081
<i>Ms Hayes, Valerie Harris
on line two for you. She says it's urgent.</i>

314
00:25:23,172 --> 00:25:25,812
- Valerie, what's happening?
- We lost Audrey.

315
00:25:25,892 --> 00:25:29,966
- What?
- She transferred the tracker to a DWP truck.

316
00:25:30,053 --> 00:25:32,773
Dammit. How? She's got no field experience.

317
00:25:32,854 --> 00:25:38,168
I don't know. We only found it cos the DWP
guy stopped to check a faulty power line.

318
00:25:38,254 --> 00:25:43,568
All right, hold your positions
and wait for my instructions.

319
00:25:44,175 --> 00:25:47,213
<i>- Papazian.
- Audrey ditched her transponder.</i>

320
00:25:47,296 --> 00:25:49,890
Redirect satellite surveillance and track her.

321
00:25:49,977 --> 00:25:54,494
I can redirect Caltrans and one sat-link,
but the rest are dedicated to finding Bauer.

322
00:25:54,577 --> 00:25:58,571
Following Audrey should lead us to him.
Tell me when you've got something.

323
00:25:58,658 --> 00:25:59,977
I'm on it.

324
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:14,051
Take the wall.

325
00:26:14,141 --> 00:26:16,096
Watch him.

326
00:26:16,181 --> 00:26:20,379
Just do what he says, Carl,
and you'll be home before you know it.

327
00:26:27,222 --> 00:26:29,213
What's the emergency procedure?

328
00:26:29,303 --> 00:26:32,102
I have 30 seconds to put my key in,
then I enter my code.

329
00:26:32,183 --> 00:26:36,655
If you enter the wrong code and alert the
police, your wife is dead. Do you understand?

330
00:26:36,744 --> 00:26:38,656
- Yes.
- Let's go.

331
00:27:05,949 --> 00:27:07,940
Where's the vault?

332
00:27:08,029 --> 00:27:12,706
Take us around the back.
Stay away from the windows.

333
00:27:22,072 --> 00:27:26,224
- How do I open it?
- It's a 12-digit code, but it's a timed unlock.

334
00:27:26,312 --> 00:27:30,909
It allows enough time for the police to arrive
if someone triggers the silent alarm.

335
00:27:30,993 --> 00:27:33,383
Write the code down for me.

336
00:27:41,434 --> 00:27:43,790
Take him to one of the desks.
Keep an eye on him.

337
00:27:43,875 --> 00:27:46,310
You heard him.

338
00:27:50,476 --> 00:27:52,707
I know you.

339
00:27:53,597 --> 00:27:56,509
- No, you don't.
- I do. You're David Palmer's brother.

340
00:27:56,597 --> 00:28:00,988
I saw you on TV this morning.
You were there when he was shot.

341
00:28:01,077 --> 00:28:05,151
What the hell are you doing in my bank,
and who is he?

342
00:28:05,238 --> 00:28:08,470
I know it's absurd to ask you to trust me
in these circumstances,

343
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:11,517
- but, believe me, you don't want to know.
- Oh, come on!

344
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:15,275
You threaten me with a gun,
you kidnap me, you're robbing my bank.

345
00:28:15,721 --> 00:28:19,191
I deserve to know
what the hell is going on here.

346
00:28:21,521 --> 00:28:23,432
All right.

347
00:28:23,522 --> 00:28:26,798
We believe there's evidence
in one of your safety deposit boxes

348
00:28:26,882 --> 00:28:30,955
that's gonna prove who was behind
the assassination of my brother, OK?

349
00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:32,681
Wayne.

350
00:28:36,684 --> 00:28:40,074
- What's going on?
- What could I say? He recognised me.

351
00:28:40,164 --> 00:28:44,919
It's all right. Mr. Mossman,
how long is the delay before the vault opens?

352
00:28:45,005 --> 00:28:47,759
Five minutes. Is that true?
Is that why you are here?

353
00:28:47,845 --> 00:28:49,074
Yes.

354
00:28:50,566 --> 00:28:52,602
Why don't you wait and get a subpoena?

355
00:28:52,686 --> 00:28:54,961
The people behind this would never let us.

356
00:28:55,047 --> 00:28:57,959
They've already tried to kill me twice tonight,

357
00:28:58,047 --> 00:29:02,643
and they're gonna try again
the very first chance they get.

358
00:29:06,848 --> 00:29:08,282
Mom!

359
00:29:10,449 --> 00:29:15,001
Ms Martin, you're in shock,
but you're gonna be OK.

360
00:29:16,369 --> 00:29:19,283
You know my name?

361
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:30,769
Where's Bauer?

362
00:29:44,575 --> 00:29:48,170
You did? Well, that's good. I'm glad.

363
00:29:48,255 --> 00:29:50,928
I'll get back to you.

364
00:29:51,816 --> 00:29:54,535
- I thought you went to bed.
- No.

365
00:29:55,536 --> 00:29:58,370
I, uh, watched you with the press.

366
00:29:58,457 --> 00:30:03,168
Well, um, that was Maury,
and he thought it went pretty well.

367
00:30:03,258 --> 00:30:05,135
Good.

368
00:30:05,217 --> 00:30:07,607
But that doesn't begin to describe it.

369
00:30:08,258 --> 00:30:11,296
Charles, you have had to
deal with more crises today

370
00:30:11,378 --> 00:30:14,850
than any president in an entire term.

371
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:18,535
You... were magnificent.

372
00:30:20,821 --> 00:30:24,734
Magnificent? Well, I like the sound of that.

373
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:27,016
Especially coming from you.

374
00:30:29,702 --> 00:30:31,693
I'm so proud of you.

375
00:30:31,782 --> 00:30:36,379
I hope I haven't embarrassed you
too much as your first lady.

376
00:30:36,463 --> 00:30:42,983
Don't be ridiculous. You walked up to the
edge a couple of times, but nobody noticed.

377
00:30:43,063 --> 00:30:46,659
I'll try to find a compliment
in there somewhere.

378
00:30:46,745 --> 00:30:49,213
I'm sorry, Marty. I didn't...

379
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:00,699
Wow.

380
00:31:00,786 --> 00:31:06,465
I was selfish today. You had so much on your
plate, you didn't need me piling more on.

381
00:31:06,547 --> 00:31:11,669
- No...
- Don't say anything. Just accept my apology.

382
00:31:11,748 --> 00:31:15,708
I do, I do. I accept your apology.

383
00:31:25,231 --> 00:31:27,540
- I have to take this privately.
- Who is it?

384
00:31:27,631 --> 00:31:31,180
- What difference does it make?
- I thought the crisis was over.

385
00:31:31,272 --> 00:31:33,866
- I thought you and I...
- All right.

386
00:31:41,313 --> 00:31:44,033
- Yes.
- We know Bauer's location.

387
00:31:44,113 --> 00:31:46,264
Evelyn gave him up.

388
00:31:46,354 --> 00:31:49,745
- Well, then, take care of it.
- My men are heading there now.

389
00:31:49,835 --> 00:31:53,510
<i>- Good. Let me know when it's done.
- I will.</i>

390
00:31:58,236 --> 00:32:04,836
I'm sorry, honey. I guess I haven't
gotten used to the idea that the crisis is over.

391
00:32:05,837 --> 00:32:07,635
- When what's done?
- What?

392
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:12,109
- You just said, "Let me know when it's done. "
- That was Jamie.

393
00:32:12,198 --> 00:32:17,068
I asked her to write me a radio speech
for tomorrow morning.

394
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,552
- We found Audrey Raines.
- Where?

395
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,790
Heading north toward Mulholland.

396
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:28,111
<i>- Get me Harris.
- Yes, ma'am.</i>

397
00:32:28,201 --> 00:32:30,237
There.

398
00:32:32,762 --> 00:32:35,322
- Harris.
- Valerie, we have a fix on Raines.

399
00:32:35,402 --> 00:32:40,477
She's heading toward the Sepulveda Pass,
coming up on Mulholland.

400
00:32:40,563 --> 00:32:42,201
Let's go.

401
00:32:55,125 --> 00:32:58,436
- Chloe, do you have a minute?
- No.

402
00:33:00,526 --> 00:33:04,725
- What is it?
- I was assigned to log all video activity.

403
00:33:04,806 --> 00:33:07,275
But part of the vector's locked out.

404
00:33:07,368 --> 00:33:10,838
- What do you mean?
- Someone's taken control of a satellite

405
00:33:10,928 --> 00:33:13,681
using a class-one priority override.

406
00:33:13,768 --> 00:33:16,920
- Do you know anything about it?
- No. I'll look into it.

407
00:33:17,008 --> 00:33:19,000
Thanks.

408
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:29,962
Crap.

409
00:33:55,534 --> 00:33:58,095
- Yes.
- All points covered. Perimeter is secure.

410
00:33:58,175 --> 00:34:00,848
- Do you have a visual?
- Yes, I did briefly.

411
00:34:00,936 --> 00:34:06,329
All right, listen. You tell your men the instant
that Bauer steps outside that bank building,

412
00:34:06,417 --> 00:34:09,887
you take him down,
then kill the others and secure the recording.

413
00:34:14,778 --> 00:34:17,497
- Which one is it?
- 23.

414
00:34:20,299 --> 00:34:23,814
Mr. Palmer, I admired your brother
a great deal. He was a great man.

415
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:26,175
Thank you.

416
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:32,493
<i>- It had to be done.
- I decide that.</i>

417
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:35,459
<i>I never authorised you to kill David Palmer.</i>

418
00:34:35,541 --> 00:34:40,571
<i>Palmer found out
about your involvement. He called your wife!</i>

419
00:34:40,663 --> 00:34:46,340
<i>I can handle my wife. My concern
is keeping this operation from collapsing.</i>

420
00:34:46,424 --> 00:34:49,621
<i>- That's Logan.
- All threads end with Cummings.</i>

421
00:34:49,704 --> 00:34:52,343
<i>He thinks he's running this. Keep it that way.</i>

422
00:34:52,424 --> 00:34:56,703
<i>I know my part, Mr. Henderson.
You just do as you're told.</i>

423
00:34:56,785 --> 00:34:59,299
- Oh, my God!
- We got what we need.

424
00:34:59,385 --> 00:35:04,460
I'm sorry we put you through this. It'll be
safer for you to stay here. Please let us out.

425
00:35:04,546 --> 00:35:06,582
I'd like to help. I've come this far.

426
00:35:06,666 --> 00:35:09,977
- We'll need your car a little longer.
- Sure. It's insured.

427
00:35:10,067 --> 00:35:14,937
Wayne, there's someone outside.
Mr. Mossman, get back in the vault now.

428
00:35:15,028 --> 00:35:18,259
- Is there any other way out?
- No, front door only. Security.

429
00:35:18,348 --> 00:35:20,226
Dammit.

430
00:35:20,309 --> 00:35:23,221
Both of you, stay here. I'll be right back.

431
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:58,664
- Men are taking up positions.
- We'll have to turn ourselves in.

432
00:35:58,755 --> 00:36:01,714
They didn't come here to arrest us,
they came to kill us.

433
00:36:01,795 --> 00:36:05,994
- What are they waiting for?
- They're waiting for us to leave the building.

434
00:36:06,076 --> 00:36:08,351
So what do you wanna do?

435
00:36:08,437 --> 00:36:10,791
- How do you trip the silent alarm?
- A key.

436
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:13,755
But if you trip that,
LAPD will be here within minutes.

437
00:36:13,837 --> 00:36:18,036
That's what I want. Henderson's men
outnumber us. If we leave now, we lose.

438
00:36:18,118 --> 00:36:20,837
The cops get the recording
if we go into custody.

439
00:36:20,919 --> 00:36:25,788
We won't. When Henderson finds out LAPD
have arrived, his men will engage them.

440
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:29,190
He doesn't want the police
to have the recording either.

441
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:33,592
- They shoot each other. How does that help?
- We have to use that as a diversion.

442
00:36:33,681 --> 00:36:37,071
It's our only way out. Trigger the alarm.

443
00:36:40,881 --> 00:36:42,440
Let's get ready.

444
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:18,389
Valerie, the feed should be coming through
to your laptop now.

445
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,199
I've got her. She's heading west on Chandler.

446
00:37:21,281 --> 00:37:24,114
<i>- How close are you to Audrey's car?
- About two miles.</i>

447
00:37:24,201 --> 00:37:26,510
<i>- Close the gap to one mile.
- Will do.</i>

448
00:37:37,803 --> 00:37:40,716
Something's wrong. The feed's breaking up.

449
00:37:42,004 --> 00:37:45,201
We're experiencing the same difficulty
with ours. Hold on.

450
00:37:45,285 --> 00:37:47,923
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

451
00:37:48,525 --> 00:37:50,834
That satellite's positioned correctly.

452
00:37:51,845 --> 00:37:54,406
I'm tracing the corruption.

453
00:37:55,446 --> 00:37:57,836
It's the server.

454
00:38:00,006 --> 00:38:03,158
- What is it?
- O'Brian's gone.

455
00:38:42,614 --> 00:38:45,367
- What were you doing?
- What?

456
00:38:45,454 --> 00:38:47,570
What were you doing?

457
00:38:47,654 --> 00:38:53,127
Are you kidding? If you really want
the details, I'll write you a report.

458
00:38:56,976 --> 00:38:58,614
Let's go. Now.

459
00:39:14,739 --> 00:39:19,336
They're here. Mr. Mossman, like I said before,
it might be safer for you to stay here.

460
00:39:19,419 --> 00:39:24,448
If these guys find me, they assume I know
about the recording, they kill me, right?

461
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:28,971
I'll take my chances with you.

462
00:39:31,021 --> 00:39:34,731
Stay as close to Mr. Palmer as you can.
I'll provide cover fire.

463
00:39:34,822 --> 00:39:37,655
Once we leave the bank, you break left.

464
00:39:38,902 --> 00:39:40,700
<i>- Yes, sir?
- What's your status?</i>

465
00:39:40,783 --> 00:39:46,017
- No change. They haven't come out.
- They've seen you. Tell your men to move in.

466
00:39:46,104 --> 00:39:48,618
Dammit. The cops are here.

467
00:39:48,704 --> 00:39:53,176
<i>- We can't let 'em have Bauer. Take 'em down.
- Yes, sir.</i>

468
00:39:54,545 --> 00:39:56,821
Drop your weapons!

469
00:39:56,905 --> 00:39:59,704
Take 'em out! Now!

470
00:40:01,026 --> 00:40:02,824
Let's go.

471
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:29,105
We need to go to the police car now. Move!

472
00:40:35,711 --> 00:40:37,430
He's been hit!

473
00:41:05,756 --> 00:41:08,317
- How's he doing?
- He's dead.

474
00:41:08,837 --> 00:41:10,191
Dammit.

475
00:41:13,358 --> 00:41:16,509
- Where are you?
- On my way. Has your father agreed to meet?

476
00:41:16,598 --> 00:41:19,067
He's landing at Van Nuys airport
in 15 minutes.

477
00:41:19,159 --> 00:41:22,708
- I'm here now.
- Good. We got the evidence.

478
00:41:22,799 --> 00:41:25,951
- Have you listened to it?
- There's no doubt it's Logan.

479
00:41:26,039 --> 00:41:28,316
You understand what this means?

480
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:32,280
We're talking about taking down
the President of the United States.
