1
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,150
<i>(Sabir) Do it now! Do it!</i>

2
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,153
- How many people died in this?
- No less than 12,000.

3
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:25,438
Four more nuclear weapons were stolen
along with the one that went off.

4
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,432
CTU is trying to determine
where Fayed was at the time.

5
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:33,310
The worst-case scenario is that he is still alive
and has the remaining nuclear weapons.

6
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:38,840
My engineer died in the blast. The device
used to reprogram the trigger was destroyed.

7
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,832
I have four more bombs whose triggers
need to be made operational.

8
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,913
You need someone who can replicate
what that device did, with modern equipment.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,956
McCarthy will find someone for us.

10
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,429
Tell the men these bombs will go off today.

11
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,877
Walid heard conversations about the bombs.

12
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:58,750
If there is an active cell inside that detention
facility, we need Walid to find out more.

13
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,308
He's wiring you. It's a two-way radio.

14
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,551
Now you're gonna tell me what we found
in your wallet. Understand?

15
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,639
You're gonna say I asked about this man.
Make them believe you're working with him.

16
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,631
What if they find out he's wearing a wire?

17
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:14,234
Guards inside are keeping an eye on him.

18
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,991
I sent Fayed to negotiate with an ex-Soviet
general about tactical nuclear weapons.

19
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,594
- What was the name of the general?
- Dmitri Gredenko.

20
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,629
Assad gave us the name of a Russian general
Fayed contacted a year ago about the nukes.

21
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,713
Gredenko did business with BXJ
Technologies, specifically with your father.

22
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,439
My father?
I haven't spoken to him for nine years.

23
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,238
We'll send someone to talk to him.

24
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,914
I should do this. He'll talk to me if I go alone.

25
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,958
You'll never guess who just called.

26
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,156
<i>- (Graem) Who?
- (Liddy) Your brother Jack.</i>

27
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,792
<i>- What's he want?
- The old man.</i>

28
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,316
We should've killed Jack
instead of handing him to the Chinese.

29
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:53,119
Look at the bright side,
you got out, you're here. Just relax a little.

30
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:58,033
Gray, people in this country are dying,
and I need some information.

31
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,759
Are you gonna give it to me,
or do I have to hurt you?

32
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,149
- What do you want from me?
- The truth!

33
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,629
It is the truth!
I swear to you on my family's life.

34
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,839
Not good enough.

35
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,238
<i>Although the crisis we face today
is a grave and dire one,</i>

36
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,231
<i>we will rise above it.</i>

37
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:26,198
<i>Our great nation has been challenged
as never before.</i>

38
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,352
<i>This time, against this enemy
armed with these weapons,</i>

39
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,079
<i>we must rely on the strength and faith</i>

40
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,037
of every single American.

41
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,076
And that faith is unshakable.

42
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:41,598
<i>We must rise above our fears,
above our bigotries, and stand our ground.</i>

43
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:46,797
<i>Our goal is the defeat of the enemy
and the preservation of our values.</i>

44
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,394
<i>Now, we have achieved that goal in the past,</i>

45
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,755
<i>and so we shall again.</i>

46
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,358
<i>Thank you.</i>

47
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,038
I wish he had not said that.

48
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,394
Sir?

49
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,516
He made a promise he can't keep.

50
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,469
The American people
have to get used to the fact

51
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,994
these new security measures
are a way of life.

52
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,116
They're not some temporary Band-Aid.

53
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,193
<i>(Karen) Now you're
making policy unilaterally, Tom.</i>

54
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,436
The president was absolutely clear
about your proposals.

55
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,353
I'm sorry. What is this about, Karen?

56
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,112
"National Guard
supplanting police in major cities".

57
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,351
"Expanding detentions based on soft intel".

58
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,432
You authorised these
without presidential consent.

59
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,910
Now, how many times do you think
we are going to be going over this?

60
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,596
I am taking preparatory steps
to allow the president to act swiftly,

61
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,398
should he decide to act at all.

62
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,914
Nobody is authorising anything.

63
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,639
That's what you said
about the detention facilities,

64
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:51,429
and those preparatory measures
turned into an illegal paramilitary operation.

65
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:55,274
Well, however you may choose to
characterise it, the president agreed...

66
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,476
That's because you distorted the facts.

67
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:02,395
Is it that you think I'm some bleeding-heart
liberal preaching civil liberties? Is that it?

68
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,869
I'll tell you what I think...

69
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:09,192
The Constitution is wonderful thing,
but back in the days of the Founding Fathers,

70
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,999
the weapon at hand
was a single-shot musket.

71
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,594
It took a half a minute to load and fire.

72
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:19,674
Fayed just killed 12,000 people in less time
without even taking aim.

73
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:24,675
I love the Constitution, but I won't be ducking
behind it when the next nuke goes off.

74
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:28,070
I'm a realist. I am willing to do
what it takes to protect this country.

75
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,675
- No, you are not.
- I am looking a little further down the road.

76
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:36,515
These warrantless arrests and detention
centres will cause irreparable damage.

77
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,398
Why don't you hop over
to the Justice Department?

78
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:43,996
You are using this crisis
to advance a very dangerous agenda, Tom,

79
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,755
and take advantage of presidential power,
and I will not let you do it.

80
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:52,709
And if you think that you are going to
wear me down, you are sadly mistaken.

81
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,951
Actually, you're wearing me down.

82
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,396
You won't make the same mistake again.

83
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:07,109
You're gonna give the file to Sharon,
and she's gonna handle it.

84
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,918
Get it done.

85
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,912
- I need Karen Hayes to go away.
- I'm putting the last...

86
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,709
I need this now. I need the president
to sign off on my proposals.

87
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,236
She has gone from being
an irritant to an obstacle.

88
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,072
She will be gone soon.

89
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,630
I'm waiting to hear from a few more people,
then you can approach her.

90
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:29,235
This work you're doing for me,
it doesn't go unnoticed.

91
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,595
Thank you, sir.

92
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,790
- Mr Buchanan.
- Yes?

93
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,998
- Are you aware of the new security mandate?
- I haven't looked. What's going on?

94
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:50,916
Anyone with a Middle Eastern background
has to put a redundancy layer on their logins.

95
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,433
I see.

96
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,830
Normally I'm not sensitive
to this kind of thing, you know that.

97
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:59,708
But this is not the time to profile
people with grade-four security clearance.

98
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,997
- I'm not gonna argue with you.
- You'll give me an exemption?

99
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,436
I'll take it to the Attorney General,
but it won't happen right away.

100
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,114
How can I work
with one hand tied behind my back?

101
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,670
You and I knew when I hired you
that a Muslim working counter terror

102
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:16,116
would have to put up with unfair measures.
This is one of them.

103
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,351
- I know, but today of all days...
- Especially today.

104
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,637
I need you to stay focused on the big picture.

105
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:28,317
When this is behind us, I will take this issue
to the Attorney General, I promise you.

106
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,518
- You heard from Jack?
- Not since he went to see his brother.

107
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:37,037
- Want me to try and reach him?
- He'll call us when he has something.

108
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:46,591
You lie to me again, the bag goes back on.
Do you understand me?

109
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,910
Start talking, Gray.

110
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,392
Dad... Dad didn't want anyone
to know where he went.

111
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:56,234
- He didn't even leave a number?
- No, you can't reach him, Jack.

112
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:59,471
He... After the bomb was detonated,

113
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,393
he told me he was cutting himself off.

114
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,916
I don't believe you.

115
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,072
- I think he told you where he was going.
- No. It's the truth.

116
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,390
- Fine.
- Oh, no, no! I don't know!

117
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:15,074
All right, all right, all right, all right!

118
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,916
He went to see a guy who works for us.
His name's Darren McCarthy.

119
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,479
Why?

120
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,031
It was my fault.

121
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,359
I made a mess. Dad's trying to clean it up.

122
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:37,560
- What do you mean?
- You were right. It's about the nukes.

123
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,200
The connection you found
between Dad and Gredenko

124
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,794
had to do with a contract
that was awarded to us.

125
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,678
- Through the company.
- Yeah. It all went through BXJ.

126
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,194
What did a general
have to do with a contract?

127
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:52,831
It was his job to release the old nukes
into the US for decommissioning.

128
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:57,232
BXJ was hired to dismantle
some of the smaller bombs

129
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:01,836
and to recycle their cores into
energy production. We do it all the time.

130
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,115
What happened?

131
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:09,274
<i>(sighs) I hired McCarthy to oversee the job
but I didn't check him out carefully enough.</i>

132
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,351
He made the lowest bid and you hired him.

133
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,830
I... I... My head
was into other things at the time.

134
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:18,435
He came with good references.
I saw no reason to get all anal about it.

135
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:22,593
The nukes the terrorists have,
including the one detonated in Valencia,

136
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,069
were supplied by McCarthy
and stolen from you?

137
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,230
Yes. In a nutshell, that's it.

138
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:32,869
Sam told me Dad left yesterday, which means
you both knew about this and didn't report it.

139
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,633
We thought we could
take care of it more efficiently.

140
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:39,235
How many people have died
because you're trying to cover your ass?

141
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,470
I had no idea this was going to happen.

142
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:45,712
What Dad and I are doing to stop this is more
effective than what your people will do.

143
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:49,110
What exactly are you doing?

144
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,635
Dad put together a security team.

145
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,836
He went out to look for McCarthy.

146
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,148
Where?

147
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,560
He was staking out McCarthy's office.

148
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,438
He checked in about an hour ago.

149
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,799
Where is this office?

150
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,871
It's in Simi.

151
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,553
We're going.

152
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,950
I'm not leaving my family, Jack, not today.

153
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,917
Oh, yes, you are.

154
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,117
Get up!

155
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:43,119
<i>(man on TV)... the wind should push the
mushroom cloud away from Los Angeles...</i>

156
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,829
- Graem, where are you going?
- Jack and I have to go find Dad.

157
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,151
- Find him?
- He's not reachable. We have to pick him up.

158
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,549
I want you to stay here with Josh.

159
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:57,873
Don't either of you go outside the house.
I'll be back as soon as I can.

160
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,074
- What's the address?
- His office in on Route 23.

161
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,072
5137 Olsen Avenue. Who are you calling?

162
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,912
<i>- (phone rings)
- CTU. O'Brian.</i>

163
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,117
<i>- It's Jack. Let me speak to Bill.
- He's being briefed on Fayed.</i>

164
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,792
- Picked up any threads?
- Not yet.

165
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:22,032
I've got one. Send two field units
to 5137 Olsen Avenue in Simi Valley.

166
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:25,032
It should be off the 23.
I want them to wait for me there.

167
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,112
- Get Bill to call me back as soon as he's out.
- OK, I will.

168
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,510
So that's it, Jack?
You're just gonna sell out Dad and me?

169
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,716
Get in the car.

170
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,518
We've monitored ground movement
since the bomb went off.

171
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,309
We've locked down streets, done searches.
Nothing. No sign of Fayed.

172
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,119
He could still be hunkered down
within the perimeter.

173
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,988
- We've got NEST teams in the area now.
- That'll take hours.

174
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,799
Yeah, Morris.
If we could do it quicker, we would.

175
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,916
We can use the fallout to our advantage.

176
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,992
If Fayed is in the perimeter,
he'll move the opposite way.

177
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:14,312
- He'll have to be monitoring the fallout.
- He's got technology in the "on" position.

178
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:18,029
- Let's use radio-frequency satellite.
- Good. Get on it.

179
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,430
Jackjust called in.
He's following a lead in Simi Valley.

180
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,636
- He wants you to call him.
- Anything else?

181
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:27,156
- No. He asked me to send two teams.
- Any leads on finding Gredenko?

182
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,913
Not yet. CIA is trying to
track him down in Moscow.

183
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,797
OK. Thank you.

184
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,115
<i>(tyres screech)</i>

185
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,993
If you give CTU McCarthy's name,
they will eventually come after the family.

186
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:46,710
Not necessarily. CTU is not interested
in networking a series of indictments.

187
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,394
Will you not be so simple-minded for once?

188
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:54,110
CTU, like every other federal organisation,
is made up of human beings with ambition.

189
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,953
When the dust settles, they will dig deeper.

190
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,191
Unfortunately for you,
right now you have to trust me.

191
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:04,319
After what you did to me at the house,
all I trust in is your sadistic tendencies.

192
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,674
<i>- (phone rings)
- Bauer.</i>

193
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,991
- What did you find out?
- Run a locator check on a Darren McCarthy.

194
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,548
- Who is he?
- An independent munitions contractor.

195
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,517
He worked for BXJ Technologies.

196
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,160
How does McCarthy figure into all this?

197
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,755
My father's company hired him
to decommission the nukes.

198
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,308
- He brokered them to Fayed.
- Except for McCarthy,

199
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,073
your father's company
had nothing to do with Fayed?

200
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,799
- I don't know BXJ's involvement yet.
- Where are you?

201
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:32,431
Heading to McCarthy's office in Simi Valley.
I might get something off his computer.

202
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:35,796
- We have teams standing by. Let me know.
- Copy that.

203
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,194
You know, if you're
doing this to come after me,

204
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:42,670
eventually Dad will get caught in the middle.

205
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:46,230
Or maybe you want that.
Maybe you want Dad to go to prison too.

206
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:52,598
Boy, Jack, it's good to see
your loyalty is still with your family.

207
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,200
If I were you, I wouldn't talk about loyalty.

208
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,630
It's not easy. That's why
they'll pay seven million dollars.

209
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,631
Can't Taylor Pascal do it?

210
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:10,077
<i>(man) He's a theoretical physicist. He doesn't
have the background to reprogram a trigger.</i>

211
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,957
<i>- Who does?
- I'm still looking.</i>

212
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,793
Fayed needs someone now.
Get me a name, dammit!

213
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,710
- Where are we going now?
- What do you care?

214
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:24,237
- Darren, I don't feel safe in this city.
- I was here when you mentioned that earlier.

215
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,795
OK.

216
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:30,271
It seems to me like whatever this is
you're trying to do is a long shot.

217
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:34,273
You're just gonna waste all this time,
and it's gonna be harder to get away.

218
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,919
- Get out!
- What?

219
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,312
Your negativity is not what I need right now!
I need less stress, not more!

220
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:58,558
How sure a thing... is this seven million?

221
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:03,351
Now, that's the type of question
that I love hearing from you.

222
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,351
<i>(phone rings)</i>

223
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,153

- Have you found an engineer?

00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,389
<i>No, not yet.</i>

225
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,232
Why not?

226
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,995
Oh! Give me a break, Fayed!
This is not some easy one-stop shopping.

227
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:22,995
- You said within the hour.
- I know what I said. It's just taking longer.

228
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,992
I told you I'd find someone. Now I will.

229
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,589
That's the last of the group.

230
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,638
- What do you do with them now?
- Patch the images to CTU.

231
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,756
They can cross them with watch lists.

232
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:44,628
- Didn't you already vet these people?
- CTU has more resources.

233
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,235
They can go deeper,
find the connection to Fayed.

234
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,668
Samuels sent us images
of the men Walid is with.

235
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:03,197
Excellent. When Nadia gets the manifests,
I'll cross them against our watch lists.

236
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,840
- Wait. Nadia didn't give you the manifests?
- No.

237
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,514
- Why not?
- I haven't a clue, mate.

238
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,239
Hey, you were supposed to send the
manifest to Comm. Why don't we have it?

239
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,515
- I'm backed up.
- Why are you backed up?

240
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,036
I'm doing my best. You got a problem with it,
take it somewhere else.

241
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,557
Hey, I'm just trying
to understand what the problem is.

242
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,473
The detention facility's
one of our only live leads.

243
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,790
Go ask Buchanan.

244
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,152
OK.

245
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:45,438
We've got a support team in place. If Jack
needs more backup, he'll let you know.

246
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,954
Yeah. What is it, Milo?

247
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:54,196
Nadia. She's falling behind on her tasks.
What's going on with her?

248
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:58,751
Nothing. Partition her workload
and hand some of it out to another analyst.

249
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:02,799
- She's only working on one process.
- She's doing things for me. Just do it.

250
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,634
Is there something going on here
you don't want me to know about?

251
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:11,077
Yes. Either give Nadia enough time
to finish the work or give it to somebody else.

252
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,549
Sir, I'm the technical leader on the floor.

253
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:18,430
If you want me to do my job effectively,
I need to know what's happening.

254
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,828
Nadia's of Middle Eastern descent.
She's been flagged by Homeland Security.

255
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,831
That's ridiculous.

256
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:32,959
She's... lived in this country
since she was two years old.

257
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,952
- She's a Republican.
- You're wasting your breath.

258
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,952
There's nothing I can do
about this right now. Let it go.

259
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:44,273
I don't see how we can. Aren't we trying to
find four nukes that might still be in this city?

260
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:47,432
- I need everybody working at full speed.
- I understand that.

261
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,590
Now get back to work.

262
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,909

- Itjust came down from the White House.

267
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,355
One of my best people is hamstrung.

268
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:20,398
She has to work twice as hard
to get through security measures.

269
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:26,271
They're not security measures, Bill. They're
the paranoid delusions of Tom Lennox.

270
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,999
Is there anything you can do?

271
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:31,355
I can talk to the president.

272
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,151
Thank you.

273
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,151
You're welcome.

274

It went off in Valencia over an hour ago.

275

<i>I'm not sure.</i>

278
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:56,517
Do you think it may have
something to do with Valencia?

279
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:00,991
- How did you get the information?
- Why are you asking so many questions?

280
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:08,072
<i>Whatever happens out there affects us in here.
We need to share everything we know.</i>

281

Heydar's been in contact.

282
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,068
How?

283
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,628
He smuggled in a cellphone.

284
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,756
How?

285
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,832
Cellphone? How did
he get a cellphone in there?

286
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:30,310
These facilities were put up quickly.
The security is pretty porous.

287
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,233
You need to get the phone
and find out who he's talking to.

288
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:36,710
If Walid can get the phone,
I can trace any call that's been made.

289
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:40,031
A live conversation
is worth more than a list of numbers.

290
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:44,910
- Fine. Then after that, get Walid out of there.
- No. They're talking to him. That's a big get.

291
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,198
We have to keep listening in
on whatever they say.

292
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,238
This is Agent Samuels.
I need to get into a cell tower.

293
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,676
Grid location 15, 27.

294
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,752
<i>(man) Copy that. Grid location 15, 27.</i>

295
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,116
It's done.

296
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,594
They will come forward
if we need them to testify?

297
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:15,717
Yes, I put the screws to every one of them.
They're all yours.

298
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,392
Good.

299
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:22,200
Oh, Karen. I need to talk to you.

300
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,748
- Just a minute.
- Now would be better.

301
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,632
- Have this signed then send it out.
- This just simply isn't working for me.

302
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,429
- I can't have you stand in my way any more.
- What?

303
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:39,071
I need the president's undivided attention,
and you, frankly, are dividing it.

304
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:42,436
I'm not gonna stop doing my job
just because it irritates you.

305
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:47,196
- I thought I made that perfectly clear.
- Yeah. I'd like you to tender your resignation.

306
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,875
My resignation. What are you smoking?

307
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,155
No, no, no.

308
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,310
I'm here to blow away all the smoke.

309
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,756
I wanna talk about your husband's
incompetence and your covering it up.

310
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:02,389
I don't like this conversation.
What are you talking about?

311
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:07,235
14 months ago, we had
Abu Fayed in CTU custody in Seattle,

312
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,754
and Bill Buchanan signed off on his release.

313
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:15,358
I don't believe this. The case that you're
referring to involved over 20 detainees.

314
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:20,878
Not prisoners, Tom, detainees. At the time,
there was not enough evidence to hold them.

315
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,509
It's a little greyer than that now.
If what you're saying is true,

316
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:28,593
how come that incident wound up
blue-coded at Homeland in a dead-end file?

317
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:34,156
I've got Peter lanona here, Curt Wag,
Myra Mock. They're all in the pipeline,

318
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,358
all ready to testify that you
sequestered that file to protect your husband.

319
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,795
I did nothing illegal or incorrect.

320
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,316
All of those detainees
were cleared of any conspiracy charges.

321
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:49,269
Nevertheless, one of these "detainees"
detonated a nuclear bomb in Los Angeles.

322
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,557
You think your husband
could survive that story? Or you?

323
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,676
Do you want to get in the ring with me?

324
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:58,912
You've got skeletons in your closet,
and I will not hesitate to pull them out.

325
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,912
We've all got our skeletons, Karen.

326
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,355
It's proof we don't all have. I've got mine.

327
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:07,000
How long before you get yours?

328
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,192
You're a son of a bitch.

329
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,840
I never claimed otherwise.

330
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:17,198
Look, I am not out
to hurt you or your husband personally.

331
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,714
I just need room to work.

332
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,598
Your resignation within the hour.

333
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:52,432
- Can we go a little slower? There's no rush.
- Morris, I'm going as fast as I can.

334
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,954
Go back to your station. I'll send it over.

335
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:59,909
Why is it taking you five minutes to do
something that should take ten seconds?

336
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,233
Because I borrowed two of her processors
to run a batch job. She's running on 20%.

337
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:08,278
Oh, yeah?
Then why didn't somebody tell me this?

338
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,828
- I just did.
- Fine.

339
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:15,118
Don't keep any secrets from me, darling.
We're on the same... side.

340
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,633
- Why did you lie for me?
- I talked to Buchanan.

341
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:25,195
Yeah. It's pretty frustrating.

342
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,191
I'm sure.

343
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:40,032
- What are you doing?
- I'm logging you in under my user ID.

344
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,917
That's illegal.

345
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,389
You didn't do it. I did.

346
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,556
Thank you.

347
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,954
There. You should... be fine.

348
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:18,635
...his relationship with his deputy chief of
staff. So I think that would speed things up.

349
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,915
I believe they're at site R.

350
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,309
Excuse me, sir. I need to speak with you.

351
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:27,916
- I'm squeezed for time. Can we talk later?
- No, sir, we can't.

352
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,070
OK.

353
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,799
Thank you.

354
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:45,712
Mr President, I am tendering my resignation,
effective immediately.

355
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:49,797
- What's going on, Karen?
- It's a personal matter, sir.

356
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:53,839
- Is there something wrong with you or Bill?
- No, we're fine. It's...

357
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,388
I cannot elaborate.

358
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:01,191
You and Tom have been locking horns
these past few weeks.

359
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,872
- Is that it?
- I'd rather not say.

360
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,110
- That is unacceptable.
- Mr President...

361
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,715
I need you. I need different points of view.

362
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:13,237
It's difficult to sit in a room with someone
who opposes you, but that is part of yourjob.

363
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:16,915
And I have never seen anyone
handle it better than you.

364
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,637
I am sorry, Karen,
but I cannot accept your resignation.

365
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,711
Not now, not today.

366
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:26,315
No disrespect, sir,
but you're going to have to.

367
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,075
Mr President, I am here to tell you
that the past few weeks

368
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:33,835
have been some of the most difficult weeks
I have ever seen a president face.

369
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:38,630
And I am truly honoured
to serve under you here in Washington.

370
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,631
I appreciate that you value my advice,

371
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:45,157
but, sir, the truth is, you have been
your own best counsellor.

372
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:50,552
You know what to do, sir.

373
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,269
And I have no doubt, absolutely no doubt...

374
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:59,628
that you will continue
to rise to this challenge.

375
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:12,229
Is there anything I can do
to change your mind?

376
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,311
No, sir. There is not.

377
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,472
I would appreciate it, however,
if you would reassign me to LA CTU.

378
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:23,358
I feel I will serve best there.

379
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:28,678
- I'll approve you for military transport west.
- Thank you, sir.

380
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,951
Mr President.

381
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,751
I'm sorry.

382
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:41,115
So am I.

383
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,513
Oh. Oh, excuse me, Karen. I'm so sorry.

384
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:02,434
Oh, Karen, I'm glad I caught you.
I've got a state department white paper

385
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:05,432
I was hoping you could look over
and take to the president.

386
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,829
No. You'll have to give it to Tom.

387
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:10,275
Well, I thought you handled that.

388
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:13,033
Give it to Tom. Excuse me.

389
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,637
<i>(phone rings)</i>

390
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,629
Yes.

391
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,917
<i>- Karen Hayes is out.
- Thank you.</i>

392
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,632
The last one is a black Kia.

393
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:01,669
California licence plate.
Niner-Yankee-Sierra-Uniform 108.

394
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,278
It's not registered to McCarthy.

395
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:08,751
Cross-reference the names of the registered
owners. See if any of them correlate.

396
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:11,035
- What about the backup teams?
- Where are they?

397
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,951
Holding a two-block radius.

398
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:17,318
Send one to the parking lot here.
Tell the other to stand by. I'll get back to you.

399
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,709
- Where's McCarthy's office?
- Second floor.

400
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,631
Let's go.

401
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,311
- You all right?
- Yes.

402
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,992
I'm fine. Thank you.

403
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,189
- All right. I've got the phone.
- Good. I'll give you a number to dial.

404
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,430
CTU can access the phone's records.

405
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:23,751
After dialling the number,
hit the star button twice.

406
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:28,391
The number is 310-597-3781.

407
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:33,190
Again, the number - 310-597-3781.

408
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:36,670
Once we get everything off the SIM,
you can put the phone back.

409
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:40,070
Hurry. It won't be long
before he discovers it's missing.

410
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:43,038
He got the phone.
There's nothing else he can do.

411
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,792
Let's just see what we get.

412
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,916
<i>- CTU. O'Brian.
- It's Agent Samuels.</i>

413
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,833
<i>We've got the phone.
I'm piping a stream to you now.</i>

414
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:52,150
<i>Work up every number you get.</i>

415
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,755
- It's coming through.
- How does it look?

416
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,877
This data's encoded.
There's over 120 numbers or so.

417
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:03,112
I can't tell if they're recently dialled or stored.
I'll get back to you in a few minutes.

418
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,714
- But you got everything, right?
- Yeah.

419
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,510
Walid did a greatjob of getting that phone.

420
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:13,672
Then please let him go before he gets hurt.

421
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,115
I'll tell you one last time, Ms Palmer.

422
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:19,192
These men know something
about the bombs that we don't.

423
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:23,353
Walid has earned their trust.
That's a situation that we've lucked into,

424
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:28,468
and we will not terminate it as long as
he can continue to harvest information.

425
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:34,313
All right, Walid, you can put the phone back.

426
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,799
OK.

427
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,992
Walid.

428
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,918
<i>(phone rings)</i>

429
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:30,792
- Yeah, Chloe.
- These guys aren't connected to anyone.

430
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:34,234
What? They knew about
the other four bombs.

431
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,914
They found out from a web page.

432
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,434
<i>- (Samuels) What?
- The cellphone had a browser on it.</i>

433
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,512
The cache had a web page.
They could have connected in.

434
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:47,310
- Was the website password protected?
- No, but a lot of people know about them.

435
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,789
They aren't terrorists, they're spectators.

436
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:54,237
- Why didn't they report the website?
- Because you have them locked up!

437
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:58,108
Why would they give you information
that would incriminate them further?

438
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:01,715
- Thanks, Chloe.
- I'm getting Walid the hell out of there.

439
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:07,511
This is Agent Samuels. Notify the guards
we are taking Walid Al-Rezani out.

440
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,956
I was at home with my wife and my children

441
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,429
and they barged right in and they grabbed me.

442
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:18,159
No search warrant, nothing.

443
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,513
They say this country is about freedom.

444
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,352
This is not freedom.

445
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:27,034
My phone. It's gone.

446
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:31,272
- What do you mean, it's gone?
- I just had it over there.

447
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,359
You. You took it.

448
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,271
No, I did not take your phone.

449
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:41,478
Yes, he did. I was walking back,
he fell in front of me.

450
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:46,758
- Search him.
- No. Get away from me.

451
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,672
- Open the gate.
- I can't do that.

452
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,955
I need to get in there right now.

453
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,759
What are you doing?

454
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:00,230
You spied on us?
You're worse than they are!

455
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,992
Son of a bitch!

456
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,559
Hey! No!

457
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,631
Let us in.

458
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,316
<i>(man) Get on the ground!</i>

459
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,919
Oh, my God!

460
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,276
Walid! Walid!

461
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,593
- My God.
- I'm OK.

462
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:44,753
- No, you're not. You're hurt.
- I need a medical team on site. Civilian down.

463
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,910
Don't move.

464
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:04,150
<i>(phone rings)</i>

465
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,229
CTU. O'Brian.

466
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:08,198
Chloe, we're here.
The parking lot's almost empty.

467
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:11,078
<i>The building's been evacuated
because of the bomb.</i>

468
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:13,196
- Does Jack want us in there?
- No.

469
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:16,750
Keep an eye on exits and entrances
and wait for my call.

470
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,956
All right. Standing by.

471
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:39,954
- Which one's his office?
- Last door on the right.

472
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,551
Let's go.

473
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,397
Take a seat.

474
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,839
What are you doing?

475
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:22,914
Looking for anything in McCarthy's system
that connects him to BXJ or the nukes.

476
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:29,278
- What's that?
- McCarthy's employment contract with BXJ.

477
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,510
Whoa, whoa. What happened there?

478
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:34,717
Some kind of electronic shredding trail.

479
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,315
Ten minutes after the bomb went off,
McCarthy started deleting files.

480
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,709
<i>(thud)</i>

481
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,519
Get up. Now.

482
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:54,436
- Come on, Jack.
- Don't make a noise.

483
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,631
<i>(rattling)</i>

484
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,431
Don't you move.

485
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:47,675
Stop.

486
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,873
You know him?

487
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,315
Yeah. He's my son.

488
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,389
I'm surprised to see you here, Jack.

489
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:02,153
We all feared the worst.

490
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:06,154
Give me my gun back.

491
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,517
What are you doing here, Jack?

492
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:15,513
I'm working with CTU.
We're looking for Darren McCarthy.

493
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:19,798
- McCarthy's not here.
- I know you're covering up. Gray told me.

494
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:23,395
- Did he? And where is he?
- McCarthy's office.

495
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,676
There's nothing there, Jack. Believe me.

496
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:31,036
- Get Graem in here.
- Wait.

497
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:36,517
You'll need these.

498
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:39,034
I didn't trust him not to run.

499
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:45,676
- I'm doing everything I can to find McCarthy.
- What in the hell are you thinking?

500
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:49,230
I only learned about it yesterday.
When Graem told me about the weapons...

501
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:52,517
The second you knew the bombs
were missing, why didn't you call?

502
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:56,878
He told me that the bombs couldn't be
detonated, the triggers were deactivated.

503
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,235
- He was wrong.
- Evidently.

504
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:06,075
Look, Jack, I'm just trying
to keep my son out of prison.

505
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:10,039
- Dad, where is McCarthy?
- I don't know.

506
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:14,238
- When I do, we can pick him up together.
- He wants us both in prison.

507
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,958
What I want is to find the nukes.

508
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:20,192
If you're held accountable for what
you've done, that's the bed you've made.

509
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:25,991
Oh, you hear that, Dad? Family love. We'd
be better off if he was still in a Chinese jail.

510
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,036
- Who are you calling?
- CTU.

511
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,192
Jack, look, work with me.

512
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:35,432
I'll tell you what I know,
but for now keep Graem out of it.

513
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,717
We're talking about prison, Jack.
He's your brother.

514
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,793
Graem knew what he was doing was wrong.
He should have been more careful.

515
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,792
When he knew they were stolen,
he should have reported it!

516
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:52,351
You always do what you should. How about
when Dad needed you and you disappeared?

517
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:56,956
- Jack, give us a chance to clean this up.
- Dad, there are four more bombs out there.

518
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:01,716
I cannot, I will not, be responsible for
thousands of lives to protect this family.

519
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:05,759
Wrong. Protecting family is everything.
I think your dead wife would agree.

520
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:08,274
- You son of a bitch!
- Jack!

521
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,876
All right. Let's do it your way.

522
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,713
- No, Dad.
- No, no, no. He's right.

523
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,791
Call CTU.

524
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,555
I don't think so.

525
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:27,038
Hey! What are you doing? Put the gun away.

526
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:31,350
- You work for me.
- No, Dad, he doesn't.

527
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:35,795
This is insane.

528
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:38,713
You don't think I'd let you loose
without keeping an eye on you?

529
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:42,588
- Tell them to put the guns away.
- Shut up, Dad.

530
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:46,593
Well, I'm glad we can all
finally put our cards on the table.

531
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,632
Family. Pff!

532
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,153
Let's go.

533
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,957
<i>- Yeah.
- (man) I've found someone.</i>

534
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:04,950
Yeah?

535
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:09,830
<i>He's got the background to reprogram the
trigger, but you'll have to force him to do it.</i>

536
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,309
<i>- And he hasn't left town?
- No, he's here.</i>

537
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,472
OK. Text me everything you got on him.

538
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:21,033
They're looking at your place. What
makes you think they can't find you here?

539
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:25,989
A, I'm not that stupid, and B, we're not gonna
be here long enough for anyone to know.

540
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:29,868
Mm. I really hope
you know what you're doing, Darren.

541
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,916
Always.

542
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,959
When I'm done with this deal,
I may just buy you a small country.

543
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:38,909
As long as it's not Palm Springs.

544
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,793
Everything's been handled. We're clear to go.

545
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:54,030
Good. Let's move.

546
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:31,118
Good God. What have you done?

547
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,634
<i>(Graem) Jack forced my hand.</i>

548
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:37,593
Call me when it's over.

549
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:47,111
