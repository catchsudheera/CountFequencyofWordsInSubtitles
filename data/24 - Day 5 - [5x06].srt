1
00:00:14,223 --> 00:00:18,342
- Any problems getting the canisters out?
- No. They were exactly where you said.

2
00:00:18,424 --> 00:00:21,462
The Russians will learn the
consequences of occupying our homeland

3
00:00:21,545 --> 00:00:23,422
when we turn Moscow into a graveyard.

4
00:00:23,746 --> 00:00:25,941
Erwich has just cleared airport security.

5
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:28,780
<i>- And the authorities don't know anything?
- Not yet.</i>

6
00:00:28,866 --> 00:00:30,505
The only thing left to take care of is Bauer.

7
00:00:30,587 --> 00:00:33,022
- You paged me?
- I need you to do something.

8
00:00:33,107 --> 00:00:36,737
- We've our hands full searching for the gas.
- Bauer is a priority.

9
00:00:37,108 --> 00:00:40,738
I just signed a treaty.
Now I find the terrorists are still out there.

10
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:42,707
With nerve gas.

11
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:45,430
You people have to listen to me.

12
00:00:45,511 --> 00:00:48,709
I had a document.
It was hidden in my blouse.

13
00:00:48,791 --> 00:00:51,147
It's gone. Someone stole it from me.

14
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:54,272
This is what she was like before Vermont.

15
00:00:54,353 --> 00:00:57,903
- Are you suggesting that I readmit her?
- Consider the option, for her sake.

16
00:00:59,155 --> 00:01:01,908
My wife is gone.
- We have a priority alert.

17
00:01:02,275 --> 00:01:06,554
You've been burrowing into classified
CTU protocols without authorisation.

18
00:01:06,636 --> 00:01:11,506
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Stop. You logged onto the subsystem.

19
00:01:11,597 --> 00:01:13,748
Someone knew that Jack was alive.

20
00:01:13,838 --> 00:01:17,195
It's critical to our investigation
that we find out who that was.

21
00:01:21,559 --> 00:01:26,999
Did you let that man into CTU? This man is
a professional assassin. He killed Dr Paulson.

22
00:01:27,081 --> 00:01:29,391
Who told you to let that man into CTU?

23
00:01:29,482 --> 00:01:30,801
The White House.

24
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:32,873
Mr. Cummings.

25
00:01:39,724 --> 00:01:45,084
Palmer was murdered because he was about
to expose Cummings' link to the terrorists.

26
00:01:45,165 --> 00:01:48,044
When Cummings failed
to frame me for it, he tried to kill me.

27
00:01:48,127 --> 00:01:50,004
Jack, we don't have proof.

28
00:01:50,086 --> 00:01:53,204
We can prove Cummings used Spenser
to get Jack's assassin in.

29
00:01:53,287 --> 00:01:55,438
Spenser's word isn't enough to build a case.

30
00:01:55,528 --> 00:01:58,964
You don't have time. You want the gas,
Cummings is your connection.

31
00:01:59,049 --> 00:02:02,565
Cummings is the president's chief advisor.
How do we get to him?

32
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:05,118
I secretly meet Mike Novick. Enlist his help.

33
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:07,202
How do we know Novick's not in this?

34
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:10,011
Because I know him. He'll listen to me.

35
00:02:10,092 --> 00:02:13,802
The president will listen to him.
With Novick, we can isolate Cummings.

36
00:02:13,893 --> 00:02:17,010
Jack, much as I appreciate this,
you don't work here any more.

37
00:02:17,094 --> 00:02:19,892
That's exactly the reason
why I should do this.

38
00:02:19,975 --> 00:02:23,445
If it backfires, there'll be no fallout on you.

39
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:27,015
- I think it's worth a try.
- I agree.

40
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:30,214
It's your call.

41
00:02:39,739 --> 00:02:41,536
All right, Jack.

42
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:45,818
But this is about finding the nerve gas,
not getting revenge for David Palmer.

43
00:02:45,901 --> 00:02:47,095
Understood.

44
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:54,899
Work out your protocols with Ms Raines.
We'll look through Cummings' background.

45
00:02:55,943 --> 00:02:59,414
I'm gonna need to set up a secure channel
for you to contact us on.

46
00:03:00,624 --> 00:03:02,297
OK.

47
00:03:02,384 --> 00:03:05,422
Can you bring up a satellite photo
of the compound?

48
00:03:08,986 --> 00:03:12,263
Jack, I'm sorry
if I'm being a little distant. I just...

49
00:03:12,347 --> 00:03:16,307
It's taking me a little while
to get used to you being alive.

50
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:19,980
I understand.

51
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:25,306
I'll call Novick.

52
00:03:25,391 --> 00:03:27,187
Jack.

53
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:35,907
When Cummings finds out that you're
still alive, he's gonna come after you again.

54
00:03:35,992 --> 00:03:37,665
Yeah.

55
00:03:48,636 --> 00:03:50,467
<i>- Yes?
- Is Bauer dead?</i>

56
00:03:50,556 --> 00:03:52,787
I haven't received confirmation yet.

57
00:03:52,877 --> 00:03:55,027
Your man should have taken care of it.

58
00:03:55,118 --> 00:03:59,237
Perhaps he had to alter his strike window.
Has the nerve gas reached the port?

59
00:03:59,318 --> 00:04:02,392
Not yet. But it should be arriving any minute.

60
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:03,628
Good.

61
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:06,598
I have to go. I'm late for a briefing.

62
00:04:13,882 --> 00:04:16,112
You have the shipping documents in order?

63
00:04:16,202 --> 00:04:18,718
The canisters will arrive in port in eight days.

64
00:04:18,803 --> 00:04:22,922
Ground transportation to your base camp
will take another day.

65
00:04:23,005 --> 00:04:25,803
- Do you need help getting them to the target?
- No.

66
00:04:25,885 --> 00:04:28,240
I've arranged transport to Moscow.

67
00:04:38,688 --> 00:04:42,318
- Would you put this on now?
- Have they found my wife yet?

68
00:04:42,409 --> 00:04:45,447
No. Secret Service is confident
she's still on the grounds.

69
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:48,806
If they're so damn confident,
why can't anyone find her?

70
00:04:48,891 --> 00:04:51,531
I'm sure it's just a matter of time,
Mr. President.

71
00:04:51,611 --> 00:04:55,845
- Sorry I'm late.
- I was just setting up the video.

72
00:04:55,933 --> 00:05:00,644
This was made by terrorists to document
the effects of exposure to nerve gas.

73
00:05:00,734 --> 00:05:04,613
It was recovered from a training camp
two years ago.

74
00:05:04,695 --> 00:05:08,211
Disorientation occurs
moments after exposure.

75
00:05:10,336 --> 00:05:14,968
Now the video jumps forward. No more
than a couple of minutes, we estimate.

76
00:05:15,057 --> 00:05:19,017
Within that time, there's permanent damage
to the central nervous system.

77
00:05:19,098 --> 00:05:24,174
Violent seizures take over,
bronchial membranes blister, peel away.

78
00:05:24,259 --> 00:05:26,979
- Death occurs within...
- Stop.

79
00:05:29,741 --> 00:05:34,179
Now, according to DOD,
the Sentox-6 nerve gas stolen from the airport

80
00:05:34,262 --> 00:05:37,414
is far more lethal
than the gas we just saw used.

81
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:40,256
If released in a town or city, for example,

82
00:05:40,343 --> 00:05:43,461
the cloud will remain lethal for much longer.

83
00:05:44,984 --> 00:05:47,944
Are we any closer to finding the canisters?

84
00:05:48,025 --> 00:05:51,224
There haven't been
any reports of progress, sir.

85
00:05:53,267 --> 00:05:55,418
Excuse me, Mr. President.

86
00:05:55,508 --> 00:05:59,342
I need to return a call to the State Department.

87
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:02,902
Do you have those updates, Walt?

88
00:06:02,989 --> 00:06:05,059
Yes, here's one from CTU.

89
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:10,228
Also one from Homeland Security.

90
00:06:16,073 --> 00:06:18,064
<i>- This is Bauer.
- Jack. Mike Novick.</i>

91
00:06:18,152 --> 00:06:19,905
It's good to hear your voice.

92
00:06:19,993 --> 00:06:21,985
Yours too, Mike.

93
00:06:22,874 --> 00:06:26,184
So sorry about David Palmer.
I know how much he meant to you.

94
00:06:26,275 --> 00:06:28,072
Yeah.

95
00:06:28,156 --> 00:06:29,748
What's going on?

96
00:06:29,835 --> 00:06:32,305
I have a lead on the stolen nerve gas.

97
00:06:32,397 --> 00:06:34,592
Isn't CTU coordinating the search?

98
00:06:34,677 --> 00:06:37,829
This is something
I need to bring directly to you.

99
00:06:37,917 --> 00:06:42,036
- I don't understand.
- I can't talk about it on the phone, Mike.

100
00:06:42,119 --> 00:06:46,636
We need to meet. No one can know about this,
not even the president.

101
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,235
I'm not comfortable
with all this secrecy, Jack.

102
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:52,234
<i>You need to give me
some idea of what this is about.</i>

103
00:06:52,321 --> 00:06:54,631
It concerns Walt Cummings.

104
00:06:55,482 --> 00:06:57,439
Ah.

105
00:06:57,523 --> 00:07:02,200
There's an area a few hundred yards
outside the southwest gate,

106
00:07:02,284 --> 00:07:04,879
at the far side of the property
from the main house.

107
00:07:04,964 --> 00:07:07,240
Thanks, Mike. I'll see you in 15 minutes.

108
00:07:11,566 --> 00:07:14,365
- Jack.
- Hey.

109
00:07:14,447 --> 00:07:17,201
- They say we can leave soon.
- I know. I heard.

110
00:07:17,287 --> 00:07:19,882
Well, what about you?
Are you coming home with us?

111
00:07:19,968 --> 00:07:23,644
No, I need to stay here.
CTU still needs my help.

112
00:07:24,849 --> 00:07:27,842
I'd like to speak with your mom
for a moment. All right?

113
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:32,049
- Yeah, of course.
- Take him downstairs. She'll be there soon.

114
00:07:38,933 --> 00:07:41,686
You're not coming back to us, are you?

115
00:07:42,693 --> 00:07:44,127
No.

116
00:07:47,535 --> 00:07:50,493
I never thought
I was gonna be back here at CTU.

117
00:07:50,576 --> 00:07:56,095
I would never have gotten you involved
in all of this, I promise you.

118
00:07:57,097 --> 00:08:02,456
It's the woman who interviewed me, isn't it?
Audrey Raines?

119
00:08:02,539 --> 00:08:05,576
You were involved with her.

120
00:08:05,659 --> 00:08:08,936
I could tell
by the way you looked at each other.

121
00:08:09,941 --> 00:08:13,173
I was with her before I had to disappear.

122
00:08:14,182 --> 00:08:16,742
Are you still in love with her?

123
00:08:18,342 --> 00:08:20,459
Yes.

124
00:08:22,824 --> 00:08:25,497
Does she still love you?

125
00:08:26,505 --> 00:08:28,575
I don't know.

126
00:08:28,665 --> 00:08:32,022
Mr. Bauer?
Your transportation's standing by.

127
00:08:32,106 --> 00:08:34,097
I'll be right there.

128
00:08:36,787 --> 00:08:38,699
I'm sorry. I have to go.

129
00:08:39,308 --> 00:08:41,299
Yeah.

130
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:52,102
Thank you.

131
00:08:54,311 --> 00:08:56,303
Yeah.

132
00:08:57,592 --> 00:08:59,424
Thank you.

133
00:09:05,594 --> 00:09:08,154
<i>I'm not comfortable

134
00:09:08,235 --> 00:09:10,510
<i>You need to give me

135

<i>at the far side of the property

138
00:09:20,798 --> 00:09:23,154
- Your man didn't do his job.
- Don't put that on me.

139
00:09:23,238 --> 00:09:25,913
You were supposed
to have Bauer killed hours ago.

140
00:09:25,999 --> 00:09:29,879
I'm not gonna warn you again.
Pull yourself together.

141
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:34,796
You heard the call, didn't you? Bauer's
coming here to expose my role in all this.

142
00:09:34,882 --> 00:09:38,192
- You're assuming he knows it all.
- It's obvious he knows enough.

143
00:09:38,282 --> 00:09:40,193
Now what the hell am I supposed to do?

144
00:09:40,283 --> 00:09:44,879
At this point,
there's only one thing you can do.

145
00:10:19,532 --> 00:10:22,525
Mrs. Logan. Please come out of there.

146
00:10:24,134 --> 00:10:26,125
Mrs. Logan.

147
00:10:30,575 --> 00:10:34,455
Aaron, don't let them take me.
You've got to listen to me.

148
00:10:34,536 --> 00:10:38,689
- They're just trying to help you.
- No. No, they're trying to set me up.

149
00:10:38,777 --> 00:10:42,407
They're trying to make it look like
I had a breakdown so they can cart me off.

150
00:10:42,498 --> 00:10:44,216
- Ma'am, they're...
- Aaron.

151
00:10:44,299 --> 00:10:46,813
It's someone in my husband's administration.

152
00:10:46,899 --> 00:10:51,132
They're trying to shut me up
because I know the truth.

153
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:54,338
- What truth?
- David Palmer.

154
00:10:54,421 --> 00:10:55,821
I know...

155
00:10:59,582 --> 00:11:04,338
- Don't let them take me, Aaron. Please.
- We have our orders, Mrs. Logan. I'm sorry.

156
00:11:04,424 --> 00:11:06,016
Aaron?

157
00:11:06,104 --> 00:11:08,096
Please?

158
00:11:10,145 --> 00:11:12,136
Aaron.

159
00:11:34,751 --> 00:11:37,141
Audrey. Did you check with the airports?

160
00:11:37,232 --> 00:11:39,951
- Yes. They've all been alerted.
- And CHP?

161
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:42,421
Trucks are being checked at all interstates.

162
00:11:42,513 --> 00:11:45,267
Make sure the gas isn't mentioned.
The White House was clear.

163
00:11:45,354 --> 00:11:49,792
I know. The bulletin only describes the
canisters. No mention of chemical weapons.

164
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:54,825
The last thing we need is for the public
to find out that nerve gas is out there.

165
00:12:37,607 --> 00:12:40,565
Schaeffer.

166
00:12:40,648 --> 00:12:42,081
What are you doing in there?

167
00:12:42,167 --> 00:12:44,636
Making sure the canisters
were secured properly.

168
00:12:44,728 --> 00:12:47,163
Don't want 'em knocking around on the ship.

169
00:12:47,248 --> 00:12:51,687
My men secured the canisters according to
my instructions. You needn't be concerned.

170
00:12:51,769 --> 00:12:56,162
All right. Here are the customs documents
you need when the shipment arrives,

171
00:12:56,251 --> 00:13:01,929
along with the remote trigger, and the arming
codes. I'll take the rest of my payment now.

172
00:13:02,013 --> 00:13:05,973
Our arrangement was you get your final
instalment when the ship left port.

173
00:13:06,053 --> 00:13:09,046
That won't be a problem.
They're loading in less than an hour.

174
00:13:09,134 --> 00:13:11,285
Then you won't have long to wait.

175
00:13:12,535 --> 00:13:15,095
Fine.

176
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:34,733
I'll be right there.

177
00:13:34,821 --> 00:13:37,210
- Ms Raines?
- Yes?

178
00:13:37,302 --> 00:13:39,862
- We've been released.
- Oh, good.

179
00:13:42,343 --> 00:13:44,857
- Can I ask you something?
- Of course.

180
00:13:46,504 --> 00:13:49,143
Do you still have feelings for Jack?

181
00:13:52,425 --> 00:13:54,416
- I'm sorry, that's personal.
- I know.

182
00:13:54,505 --> 00:13:59,058
But he's been living with my son and me
for the last six months.

183
00:13:59,146 --> 00:14:01,900
We started to become a family.

184
00:14:04,668 --> 00:14:07,057
And I care about him.

185
00:14:08,989 --> 00:14:11,379
Do you know he still loves you?

186
00:14:17,191 --> 00:14:20,264
If you don't love him, let him go.

187
00:14:48,439 --> 00:14:51,591
- Bauer.
- Jack, it's Audrey.

188
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:53,671
<i>What's going on?</i>

189
00:14:55,201 --> 00:14:57,078
Jack...

190
00:14:58,441 --> 00:15:00,432
What?

191
00:15:01,802 --> 00:15:03,794
Audrey, what?

192
00:15:07,444 --> 00:15:10,038
When this is over, are you coming back?

193
00:15:15,926 --> 00:15:17,120
I don't know.

194
00:15:18,967 --> 00:15:21,242
Are you going back to Diane?

195
00:15:21,326 --> 00:15:25,162
No. I-I don't know what I'm doing yet.

196
00:15:25,248 --> 00:15:27,478
<i>I haven't had any time to think about it.</i>

197
00:15:27,568 --> 00:15:30,766
- Is it true, what she said?
- What'd she say?

198
00:15:31,609 --> 00:15:34,044
That you still love me.

199
00:15:40,772 --> 00:15:43,492
I never stopped loving you.

200
00:15:44,173 --> 00:15:46,368
Not for one second.

201
00:15:46,453 --> 00:15:49,730
Then don't go away again, Jack. Please.

202
00:15:51,335 --> 00:15:55,647
- It's more complicated than that.
- I know.

203
00:16:00,336 --> 00:16:02,008
It's time.

204
00:16:02,097 --> 00:16:05,612
<i>- I've gotta go.
- Jack...</i>

205
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:09,533
- I have to go.
- Yeah, I know. I know. OK. Bye.

206
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:26,214
No, no. Keep me outta this.

207
00:16:26,303 --> 00:16:30,456
The last thing I want to do is comment
to the press about the roadblocks going up.

208
00:16:30,544 --> 00:16:35,460
And we can't have any leaks about
the nerve gas. It would just cause a panic.

209
00:16:35,545 --> 00:16:37,025
Come in.

210
00:16:37,105 --> 00:16:39,860
- Pardon me, we've found Mrs. Logan.
- Is she all right?

211
00:16:39,946 --> 00:16:43,542
She's fine, sir.
She was hiding in the stables.

212
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:47,337
The stables.
What the hell did she think she was doing?

213
00:16:47,428 --> 00:16:49,989
Mr. President.

214
00:16:50,069 --> 00:16:53,426
I feel awkward mentioning this, but...

215
00:16:53,509 --> 00:16:55,705
Mrs. Logan said some things.

216
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:57,860
- About David Palmer?
- Yes, sir.

217
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:02,668
I've heard her conspiracy theories, Aaron.

218
00:17:06,032 --> 00:17:08,832
I've heard them all.

219
00:17:08,913 --> 00:17:12,145
But thank you for your concern, Aaron.

220
00:17:18,755 --> 00:17:20,826
They found my wife.

221
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:24,306
Good.

222
00:17:27,198 --> 00:17:29,189
Mr. President.

223
00:17:30,199 --> 00:17:33,032
We need to talk.

224
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,236
What is it, Walt?

225
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:39,758
I was hoping to spare you from this,
but I'm afraid Jack Bauer's forcing my hand.

226
00:17:39,841 --> 00:17:43,198
He's on his way here
to meet with Mike Novick.

227
00:17:43,282 --> 00:17:45,591
Bauer? Why?

228
00:17:45,682 --> 00:17:48,720
To accuse me of helping the terrorists
acquire the nerve gas.

229
00:17:48,803 --> 00:17:50,920
That's ridiculous.

230
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:52,596
No, sir.

231
00:17:52,684 --> 00:17:55,642
It's the truth.

232
00:17:55,725 --> 00:17:57,955
What did you say?

233
00:17:58,045 --> 00:18:02,677
Through a proxy, I leaked information to the
terrorists about where the gas was hidden.

234
00:18:02,767 --> 00:18:05,999
This gas was never
gonna pose a threat to American lives...

235
00:18:06,087 --> 00:18:08,204
Never pose a threat?

236
00:18:08,288 --> 00:18:11,326
People died in the airport.
Hostages were killed.

237
00:18:11,409 --> 00:18:16,245
- We had hoped to limit the collateral damage.
- What are you thinking?

238
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:18,400
This is an unspeakable crime.

239
00:18:23,172 --> 00:18:25,049
Walt.

240
00:18:26,052 --> 00:18:28,726
- You have to answer for this.
- Mr. President.

241
00:18:28,813 --> 00:18:34,013
It's in your best interest to hear me out
before you make that phone call.

242
00:18:34,094 --> 00:18:36,655
What do you mean, "my best interest"?

243
00:18:37,135 --> 00:18:39,365
The gas is being smuggled out of the country

244
00:18:39,455 --> 00:18:42,893
by separatists who think they're
going to use it against the Russians.

245
00:18:42,977 --> 00:18:46,050
However, that nerve gas
will never reach Russian soil.

246
00:18:46,138 --> 00:18:48,288
And you know this how?

247
00:18:48,378 --> 00:18:51,177
We control the remote detonators
on those canisters.

248
00:18:51,258 --> 00:18:56,129
As soon as they reach the terrorist base,
we'll trigger the canisters and release the gas.

249
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,688
What happened today
was just to kill terrorists?

250
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:02,012
No, the goal is to produce a smoking gun.

251
00:19:02,101 --> 00:19:07,735
Proof of the existence of
weapons of mass destruction in central Asia.

252
00:19:07,822 --> 00:19:11,213
- This is unbelievable.
- No. It's necessary.

253
00:19:11,303 --> 00:19:14,774
It will give us a pretext to increase
our military presence there,

254
00:19:14,864 --> 00:19:18,255
guaranteeing the flow of oil
for the next generation.

255
00:19:18,345 --> 00:19:22,703
How dare you?
How dare you act without my consent?

256
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:27,908
How dare you put this administration,
this entire country, in jeopardy?

257
00:19:27,987 --> 00:19:30,297
- You're a traitor.
- No.

258
00:19:30,388 --> 00:19:32,778
No, Mr. President, I am a patriot!

259
00:19:32,869 --> 00:19:39,310
Doing what needs to be done for the
continued safety and wellbeing of this nation.

260
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:41,666
My God.

261
00:19:41,751 --> 00:19:44,550
You gave the order
to have David Palmer killed.

262
00:19:44,632 --> 00:19:47,704
That was an unfortunate,
but necessary, intervention.

263
00:19:47,792 --> 00:19:51,024
- He found out too much. We had...
- Walt.

264
00:19:51,113 --> 00:19:54,823
You're rationalising murder.
The murder of a president.

265
00:19:54,914 --> 00:19:58,272
Contact these people,
recover the gas before it leaves the country.

266
00:19:58,355 --> 00:20:00,870
- I'm afraid I can't do that.
- Why not?

267
00:20:00,956 --> 00:20:04,552
I don't know where the gas is.
The man I have working inside has gone dark.

268
00:20:04,636 --> 00:20:06,787
He's unreachable.

269
00:20:07,237 --> 00:20:11,198
Now, you let things play out as they are.

270
00:20:11,278 --> 00:20:14,589
Otherwise, your administration
will be implicated,

271
00:20:14,679 --> 00:20:17,831
and your presidency will be destroyed.

272
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,633
It's your choice, Mr. President.

273
00:21:06,972 --> 00:21:08,929
Jack.

274
00:21:09,012 --> 00:21:11,686
Thanks for seeing me like this, Mike.

275
00:21:12,413 --> 00:21:15,088
What is it?

276
00:21:15,174 --> 00:21:18,770
- Did you tell anyone we were meeting?
- Of course not.

277
00:21:24,177 --> 00:21:27,374
Son of a bitch. Who did you tell?

278
00:21:27,457 --> 00:21:31,053
- Who did you tell?
- I didn't tell anybody, Jack.

279
00:21:31,138 --> 00:21:34,370
<i>Jack Bauer. Stay right where you are.</i>

280
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:41,571
<i>- Put down your weapon.
- Tell your men to stand down!</i>

281
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:44,095
- Sir, we can't do that.
- He's here at my request.

282
00:21:44,181 --> 00:21:46,616
We have orders to use force if necessary.

283
00:21:46,701 --> 00:21:51,140
- Orders? From who?
- The president of the United States.

284
00:21:56,304 --> 00:21:58,295
Get on your knees.

285
00:22:05,067 --> 00:22:09,106
<i>Affirmative, sir. Bauer was
apprehended with no resistance on his part.</i>

286
00:22:09,188 --> 00:22:13,785
<i>- We're transporting him back to the retreat.
- Thanks.</i>

287
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:19,224
Novick and Bauer
have been taken into custody.

288
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:22,347
- So we're just gonna lock Mike Novick up?
- For the time being.

289
00:22:22,431 --> 00:22:25,583
What good will it do?
Eventually, he's gonna talk to the press.

290
00:22:25,671 --> 00:22:30,427
- What can he say? He doesn't know anything.
- You told me he talked to Jack Bauer.

291
00:22:30,513 --> 00:22:33,744
We stopped Bauer
before he could give Mike any details.

292
00:22:33,834 --> 00:22:36,985
What's he gonna think? We're detaining him.

293
00:22:37,074 --> 00:22:40,830
Bauer was about to divulge secrets
that Mike's not authorised to hear.

294
00:22:40,915 --> 00:22:43,714
That's why Mike's being detained.

295
00:22:43,796 --> 00:22:49,747
What about Bauer? He must have talked to
people at CTU and told them what he knows.

296
00:22:49,837 --> 00:22:53,308
As soon as this nerve gas leaves US soil,

297
00:22:53,398 --> 00:22:59,395
it's gonna be very difficult to prove that
either of us is connected to this in any way.

298
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:02,234
Are you sure these detonators will work?

299
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,757
The gas will be released
before it can be used against the Russians?

300
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:07,638
Yes.

301
00:23:07,722 --> 00:23:13,116
Right now, all you need to do is authorise me
to terminate CTU's involvement in this matter.

302
00:23:13,203 --> 00:23:17,402
Tell them we've got the situation
under control and that we'll deal with Bauer.

303
00:23:17,485 --> 00:23:21,957
Who, after all, is not
officially affiliated with them any longer.

304
00:23:26,046 --> 00:23:27,799
All right.

305
00:23:27,887 --> 00:23:29,036
Good.

306
00:23:36,929 --> 00:23:40,923
<i>- Yes?
- Mr. President, Mrs. Logan for you.</i>

307
00:23:42,971 --> 00:23:44,962
<i>- Not now.
- Yes, sir.</i>

308
00:24:16,299 --> 00:24:17,732
Dunley.

309
00:24:19,179 --> 00:24:23,936
What is Jack Bauer doing here, why is
he under arrest, and why wasn't I told?

310
00:24:24,021 --> 00:24:26,376
- Orders of the president.
- Directly?

311
00:24:26,461 --> 00:24:30,012
No, they came
through Walt Cummings' office.

312
00:24:31,023 --> 00:24:33,253
OK. Thank you.

313
00:24:38,384 --> 00:24:42,617
We're no longer on the search for the
canisters. We've been ordered off by Division.

314
00:24:42,706 --> 00:24:43,900
Why?

315
00:24:43,985 --> 00:24:46,136
The White House wants to use their people.

316
00:24:46,226 --> 00:24:51,143
- That doesn't make sense. We'll waste hours.
- I know. The president's not taking my calls.

317
00:24:51,227 --> 00:24:55,427
- What about Mike Novick?
- Unreachable. Jack's cell goes to voicemail.

318
00:24:55,508 --> 00:24:58,945
- Something's wrong.
- I know. But I don't know what we can do.

319
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:01,021
- I do.
- What?

320
00:25:01,109 --> 00:25:04,467
- Disregard the order.
- We won't disregard a presidential order.

321
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:06,621
If we don't, we won't find this nerve gas.

322
00:25:06,712 --> 00:25:10,102
Sending Jack to Mike Novick
as a private citizen is one thing.

323
00:25:10,192 --> 00:25:13,344
But I'm not about to disobey
a direct order from the White House.

324
00:25:13,433 --> 00:25:19,304
That's because you don't have
the experience to know any better.

325
00:25:19,394 --> 00:25:23,468
Mr. Buchanan,
would you step outside for a moment?

326
00:25:27,876 --> 00:25:30,391
- I can't have you talking like that.
- Sorry.

327
00:25:30,477 --> 00:25:33,390
- Are we clear about who's in charge?
- My advice stands.

328
00:25:33,478 --> 00:25:37,916
If this orderjeopardises our chances
of finding that gas, you must ignore it.

329
00:25:37,999 --> 00:25:41,834
At least until we can
bring our case to the White House.

330
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,036
- You need to make decisions faster.
- Bill.

331
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:47,238
One more thing that comes with experience.

332
00:25:47,322 --> 00:25:53,319
If we don't do everything in our power to
stop these terrorists, we're not doing our job.

333
00:25:57,004 --> 00:25:59,997
- OK. Disregard the order.
- Thank you.

334
00:26:03,246 --> 00:26:06,556
Is there anything else
you'd like me to pack for you?

335
00:26:06,646 --> 00:26:09,444
Maybe a few of your nicer dresses?

336
00:26:11,127 --> 00:26:13,881
I'm being confined
to a psychiatric ward, Evelyn.

337
00:26:13,967 --> 00:26:17,086
I don't think
there are gonna be any black-tie events.

338
00:26:17,169 --> 00:26:19,000
Sorry.

339
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:23,201
How'd this happen?

340
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:27,763
What's that, Mrs. Logan?

341
00:26:27,851 --> 00:26:29,842
Charles and me.

342
00:26:32,053 --> 00:26:34,044
I was his confidante.

343
00:26:35,573 --> 00:26:41,923
All his years in Congress, my opinion
was the one that mattered most to him.

344
00:26:43,535 --> 00:26:45,527
Now I'm...

345
00:26:47,576 --> 00:26:50,454
less than an afterthought.

346
00:26:50,537 --> 00:26:54,530
I'm sure the president
would be here if he could.

347
00:26:56,418 --> 00:26:59,536
He's the president
of the United States, Evelyn.

348
00:26:59,619 --> 00:27:02,180
He can do whatever he wants.

349
00:27:02,259 --> 00:27:04,729
If he wanted to be here, he would be.

350
00:27:21,705 --> 00:27:25,254
Mr. Bauer. You're being moved,
per the president's orders.

351
00:27:25,345 --> 00:27:27,701
- Where?
- To a class three detention facility.

352
00:27:27,786 --> 00:27:31,382
On what charges?
I was invited here by Mike Novick.

353
00:27:31,467 --> 00:27:34,061
Those are my orders, sir.

354
00:27:35,708 --> 00:27:39,224
You're Pierce, right? Aaron Pierce.
You served under David Palmer.

355
00:27:39,309 --> 00:27:41,948
- Yes, I did.
- I need to speak with you for a moment.

356
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:47,059
- That's not possible.
- It concerns David Palmer's killer.

357
00:27:47,151 --> 00:27:48,140
All right.

358
00:27:48,231 --> 00:27:51,622
Palmer was assassinated
because he was on the verge of discovering

359
00:27:51,712 --> 00:27:55,911
the terrorists that attacked us today were
helped by someone in the administration.

360
00:27:55,993 --> 00:27:57,824
- Who?
- Walt Cummings.

361
00:27:59,193 --> 00:28:02,982
- Why would he be involved with terrorists?
- I couldn't tell you.

362
00:28:03,075 --> 00:28:06,192
But the terrorists are in possession
of a weaponised nerve gas

363
00:28:06,276 --> 00:28:10,269
and Walt Cummings may be the last chance
we have to stop them in time.

364
00:28:10,356 --> 00:28:13,907
Walt Cummings ordered
the assassination of David Palmer.

365
00:28:13,998 --> 00:28:17,958
I know that's hard to believe,
but I can prove it. It's true.

366
00:28:18,038 --> 00:28:20,872
Actually, it's not that hard to believe.

367
00:28:20,959 --> 00:28:24,873
The first lady also thinks
someone in the administration was involved.

368
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:30,035
Your primary responsibility as lead agent is
to protect the president of the United States.

369
00:28:30,121 --> 00:28:32,875
Someone in his administration
is undermining him.

370
00:28:32,962 --> 00:28:35,113
That is equivalent to a coup d'état.

371
00:28:36,523 --> 00:28:40,517
Agent Pierce, please. Please. I need your help.

372
00:28:58,208 --> 00:29:01,519
- Bauer's escaped.
- When? I didn't get a code alert.

373
00:29:01,609 --> 00:29:05,364
My comm's down. Call it in,
have agents cover the west gate.

374
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:09,842
- What about you?
- I'll take your post. Go.

375
00:29:09,931 --> 00:29:11,923
Yes, sir.

376
00:29:17,053 --> 00:29:21,252
That was NSA. CTU hasn't transferred
the search operation to their jurisdiction.

377
00:29:21,334 --> 00:29:23,166
- What's the problem?
- I don't know.

378
00:29:23,255 --> 00:29:25,530
Call Lynn McGill, make sure we're in charge.

379
00:29:25,615 --> 00:29:30,816
He's going to ask why CTU's been pulled off
the search and I don't know what to tell him.

380
00:29:30,896 --> 00:29:34,651
You don't have to tell him anything.
You're the president.

381
00:29:34,737 --> 00:29:39,415
Agent Pierce, we're in the middle
of a meeting, if you don't mind.

382
00:29:39,498 --> 00:29:43,128
Mr. President, my name is Jack Bauer.
I'm sorry to confront you like this.

383
00:29:43,219 --> 00:29:49,660
But your chief of staff is withholding
information vital to this nation's security.

384
00:29:50,821 --> 00:29:52,221
Stop this!

385
00:29:54,742 --> 00:29:57,860
I'm the president of the United States.
Get your hands off him.

386
00:29:57,943 --> 00:30:00,094
- Do something.
- I am, Mr. President.

387
00:30:00,184 --> 00:30:02,459
I'm upholding my oath to protect you.

388
00:30:02,544 --> 00:30:05,981
That won't have any effect, sir.
I've overridden the distress line.

389
00:30:06,065 --> 00:30:08,785
Mr. Cummings is guilty
of conspiring with terrorists.

390
00:30:08,865 --> 00:30:11,381
He facilitated the theft of a military nerve gas

391
00:30:11,466 --> 00:30:15,222
and is responsible for the death
of three people, including David Palmer.

392
00:30:15,307 --> 00:30:20,063
- I know about that. There's an explanation.
- What do you mean, you know about that?

393
00:30:20,149 --> 00:30:23,984
Please. I just found out a couple of minutes
ago. It's very complicated.

394
00:30:24,069 --> 00:30:27,062
I don't know what he's told you,
but we need to find that gas,

395
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:29,220
immediately, before it's too late.

396
00:30:29,311 --> 00:30:31,302
- It's already too late.
- What?

397
00:30:31,391 --> 00:30:34,782
Apparently, it's on its way out of the country.

398
00:30:36,432 --> 00:30:38,628
- Where is it?
- He told me he doesn't know.

399
00:30:38,713 --> 00:30:42,707
- He's lying to you, sir.
- The man I had inside has gone dark.

400
00:30:42,794 --> 00:30:45,434
I don't know.

401
00:30:48,795 --> 00:30:50,787
I'm done talking with you, understand?

402
00:30:50,876 --> 00:30:53,994
You've read my file.
First, I'm gonna take out your right eye.

403
00:30:54,077 --> 00:30:56,386
Then your left. And then I'm gonna cut you.

404
00:30:56,477 --> 00:30:59,550
I'll keep cutting
until I get the information that I need.

405
00:30:59,638 --> 00:31:03,473
So, for the last time, where is the nerve gas?

406
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,551
I don't know.

407
00:31:09,841 --> 00:31:12,481
Stop. Stop! Stop! I'll tell you. I'll tell you.

408
00:31:13,481 --> 00:31:17,111
I'll tell you. It's on a freighter
leaving the port of Long Beach at 2:30.

409
00:31:17,202 --> 00:31:20,355
- How is it concealed?
- In a container of medical supplies.

410
00:31:20,444 --> 00:31:22,241
- Container number?
- I don't know.

411
00:31:22,324 --> 00:31:25,475
- What's the number?
- I don't know! I'd tell you, I swear.

412
00:31:25,564 --> 00:31:27,636
Mr. Bauer!

413
00:31:27,725 --> 00:31:29,716
I don't know.

414
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:50,603
<i>Mr. Buchanan,
I've got Jack Bauer on line three.</i>

415
00:31:50,691 --> 00:31:52,488
Jack, what's going on?

416
00:31:52,571 --> 00:31:55,484
Bill, hold on.
I'm gonna put you on speakerphone.

417
00:31:55,572 --> 00:31:57,608
Bill, I'm here with the president.

418
00:31:57,693 --> 00:32:00,765
The gas is in Long Beach
in a container of medical supplies,

419
00:32:00,853 --> 00:32:04,848
on a freighter bound for central Asia.
It's set to depart at 2:30pm.

420
00:32:04,934 --> 00:32:07,768
- How solid is the intel?
- It's direct from Cummings.

421
00:32:07,855 --> 00:32:12,247
We've been trying to reach you about an order
we received changing our jurisdiction.

422
00:32:12,336 --> 00:32:13,485
Disregard the order.

423
00:32:13,576 --> 00:32:16,888
You want CTU to maintain
operational control of the retrieval?

424
00:32:16,977 --> 00:32:18,569
Yes. Absolutely.

425
00:32:18,658 --> 00:32:22,333
- I'm alerting CBP.
- Get hazmat teams to set up a perimeter.

426
00:32:22,419 --> 00:32:26,014
Have medical teams standing by
in case the gas is released.

427
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:29,935
Good work, Jack.
Are you heading back to CTU?

428
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:31,420
I don't know yet.

429
00:32:31,501 --> 00:32:34,062
We'll let you know
when we have more on the container.

430
00:32:34,141 --> 00:32:35,621
Copy that.

431
00:32:39,383 --> 00:32:42,376
Mr. President, Agent Pierce and I

432
00:32:42,464 --> 00:32:47,255
are prepared to hand ourselves over
to the authorities now.

433
00:32:50,786 --> 00:32:52,856
Aaron.

434
00:32:52,946 --> 00:32:54,744
Yes, Mr. President?

435
00:32:54,827 --> 00:32:59,457
Take back your shield
and get Walt Cummings out of my sight.

436
00:32:59,548 --> 00:33:01,539
Yes, sir.

437
00:33:20,233 --> 00:33:23,385
He told me it was too late, and I believed him.

438
00:33:25,874 --> 00:33:29,390
You need to understand.
I trusted Walt Cummings.

439
00:33:29,475 --> 00:33:32,991
But he lied to me. I was coerced.

440
00:33:38,838 --> 00:33:43,151
There is one more thing
that we need to discuss.

441
00:33:43,239 --> 00:33:45,707
- What is that, sir?
- You.

442
00:33:45,799 --> 00:33:49,396
The fact that you're alive
presents problems for both of us.

443
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,156
Yes, Mr. President.

444
00:33:54,401 --> 00:33:57,633
I accomplished what I set out to do,

445
00:33:57,722 --> 00:34:01,841
which was to identify and locate
David Palmer's killer.

446
00:34:02,643 --> 00:34:07,082
I would like to stay on
until the nerve gas is retrieved,

447
00:34:07,164 --> 00:34:12,319
but after that I give you my word
I will simply disappear again.

448
00:34:13,806 --> 00:34:19,040
All right. I think that would be best,
for the good of the country.

449
00:34:20,488 --> 00:34:22,763
Yes, sir.

450
00:34:25,849 --> 00:34:28,124
Thank you, Mr. Bauer.

451
00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:30,280
Thank you, Mr. President.

452
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:33,842
Excuse me.

453
00:35:11,981 --> 00:35:14,176
I'll see you soon.

454
00:35:27,144 --> 00:35:31,104
Hold on.
- What's happening?

455
00:35:31,185 --> 00:35:32,504
- Marty.
- Charles.

456
00:35:32,586 --> 00:35:35,259
Come on, get out of the car. Come here.

457
00:35:35,986 --> 00:35:37,579
What?

458
00:35:40,347 --> 00:35:44,307
You were right. There was a conspiracy.
David was trying to warn you, and me.

459
00:35:44,389 --> 00:35:47,222
- I should have listened to you.
- I-I...

460
00:35:48,429 --> 00:35:50,785
You... You believe me now?

461
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:53,342
It was Walt Cummings.

462
00:35:53,431 --> 00:35:56,184
He lied to me.
He convinced me you were out of control.

463
00:35:56,271 --> 00:35:57,341
- Walt?
- Yeah.

464
00:35:57,432 --> 00:36:01,904
Sending you back
to the clinic in Vermont was his idea.

465
00:36:04,513 --> 00:36:08,666
- And you went along with it.
- I'm sorry, Marty.

466
00:36:08,754 --> 00:36:13,546
Sending me away without a word.

467
00:36:13,636 --> 00:36:17,835
Like I was some nuisance to be gotten rid of.

468
00:36:22,638 --> 00:36:25,948
Excuse me. You wanted to know
when a link with CTU was established.

469
00:36:26,039 --> 00:36:28,030
Yes. Um...

470
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:32,193
Thank you, Wendy. See that
the first lady's bags get back to her room.

471
00:36:32,281 --> 00:36:34,475
Of course.

472
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:40,877
I've gotta go.

473
00:36:56,974 --> 00:36:59,170
Chloe, do we have
confirmation on the intel?

474
00:36:59,256 --> 00:37:02,453
There's only one ship scheduled
to leave Long Beach at 2:30.

475
00:37:02,536 --> 00:37:05,495
It's a freighter heading for Asia
leaving from pier F.

476
00:37:05,577 --> 00:37:07,853
We don't have any CTU teams in the vicinity,

477
00:37:07,937 --> 00:37:11,487
but we've got a Customs and Border
Protection task force onsite.

478
00:37:11,578 --> 00:37:15,208
Make sure they understand
the nerve gas is in 20 unmarked canisters

479
00:37:15,299 --> 00:37:17,370
in a shipment of medical supplies.

480
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:22,410
They know that. But there's about a thousand
containers, and we don't know which one.

481
00:37:22,501 --> 00:37:24,776
Container 539-146, box 7.

482
00:37:24,862 --> 00:37:29,299
I hacked into the ship's manifest. It's the
only container stocking medical supplies.

483
00:37:29,383 --> 00:37:32,535
- Make sure the strike force units have that.
- Right.

484
00:37:32,623 --> 00:37:34,899
The White House is requesting a live feed.

485
00:37:34,984 --> 00:37:40,537
We'll have Chloe patch 'em in
once the tac teams reach the staging area.

486
00:37:43,426 --> 00:37:44,621
That's him.

487
00:37:44,706 --> 00:37:49,498
<i>Ivan Erwich. He's a
chemical engineer, trained at St Petersburg.</i>

488
00:37:49,588 --> 00:37:52,102
Joined a separatist movement six years ago.

489
00:37:52,188 --> 00:37:54,827
Do you have any clearer images,
any file photos?

490
00:37:54,909 --> 00:37:58,823
No. Which is why we need you to ID him
when the strike force has a visual.

491
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:02,107
OK. Just make sure that CBP knows
we need to take Erwich alive.

492
00:38:02,191 --> 00:38:03,670
They know. Stand by.

493
00:38:03,751 --> 00:38:06,903
- What's the situation?
- Strike team is in place, Mr. President.

494
00:38:06,992 --> 00:38:10,189
We're just waiting
for the video feed to come up.

495
00:38:10,713 --> 00:38:12,704
Feed's up.

496
00:38:17,114 --> 00:38:20,995
<i>CTU, we have located
the target container. No hostiles present.</i>

497
00:38:21,075 --> 00:38:22,589
You have a green light.

498
00:38:22,676 --> 00:38:26,464
<i>Remember, do not discharge your weapons
unless absolutely necessary.</i>

499
00:38:26,556 --> 00:38:29,868
<i>If a bullet breaches a canister,
we'll have massive casualties.</i>

500
00:38:29,957 --> 00:38:31,914
Copy that.

501
00:38:52,363 --> 00:38:54,115
Masks on.

502
00:38:55,404 --> 00:38:56,632
Go!

503
00:38:59,005 --> 00:39:00,154
<i>Go, go, go.</i>

504
00:39:04,366 --> 00:39:08,280
Don't move. Put your hands in the air now.

505
00:39:15,809 --> 00:39:17,926
He's dead. Open 'em up.

506
00:39:18,009 --> 00:39:20,922
Open 'em up. Open 'em all up.

507
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:23,160
<i>Moving on, moving on.</i>

508
00:39:23,251 --> 00:39:25,765
<i>Come on, get it open.</i>

509
00:39:25,851 --> 00:39:29,003
<i>Open it, come on, move it. Open it.</i>

510
00:39:32,493 --> 00:39:35,008
Open it. Come on, come on.

511
00:39:35,094 --> 00:39:38,326
What have we got?
What have we got? Nothing?

512
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:41,724
There are no gas canisters here, CTU.

513
00:39:41,816 --> 00:39:44,171
<i>Repeat, the nerve gas is not here.</i>

514
00:39:44,256 --> 00:39:47,566
- Get Walt Cummings in here now.
- Yes, sir.

515
00:39:49,697 --> 00:39:51,335
Dammit!

516
00:39:51,418 --> 00:39:53,807
The nerve gas isn't there.

517
00:39:53,899 --> 00:39:57,255
- It has to be.
- Where are the canisters?

518
00:39:57,339 --> 00:40:00,412
I don't know. I-I've told you everything.

519
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,969
They have to be there.

520
00:40:05,341 --> 00:40:06,376
Oh, God.

521
00:40:06,461 --> 00:40:10,456
- What is it?
- That's Schaeffer, the man we had inside.

522
00:40:10,542 --> 00:40:15,298
They must have found out
we've reprogrammed the detonators.

523
00:40:36,829 --> 00:40:38,945
It's his cellphone, sir.

524
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:43,622
- Who's calling you?
- That's Schaeffer's number.

525
00:40:43,711 --> 00:40:44,700
- Bill?
- Yeah?

526
00:40:44,791 --> 00:40:48,307
- I want you to monitor and record this call.
- We're on it.

527
00:40:48,391 --> 00:40:50,144
Answer it now.

528
00:40:52,392 --> 00:40:53,189
Yes?

529
00:40:53,273 --> 00:40:56,185
<i>We know
you've altered the arming codes.</i>

530
00:40:56,274 --> 00:40:58,834
- Who is this?
- I think you know my name.

531
00:40:58,914 --> 00:41:03,864
As I now know yours.
Your man Schaeffer confessed everything.

532
00:41:03,955 --> 00:41:06,345
<i>Is President Logan with you?</i>

533
00:41:07,317 --> 00:41:11,675
The president had nothing to do with this.
Nor did anyone else in the government.

534
00:41:11,757 --> 00:41:14,352
<i>- I was acting alone.
- You expect me to believe that?</i>

535
00:41:14,438 --> 00:41:19,309
It's the truth. Erwich, listen.
We can negotiate something.

536
00:41:19,399 --> 00:41:22,916
I don't negotiate with my enemies.
I eliminate them.

537
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,313
Your country
is about to pay a very steep price.
