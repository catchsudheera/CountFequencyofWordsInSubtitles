1
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,390
Curtis! Everyone back!

2
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:22,431
The hard drive is mostly toast, but I was able
to recover the most recently accessed file.

3
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:27,036
Some kind of wiring schematic.
How much of the file do we have?

4
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:30,715
About a page and a half.
Mostly in Arabic, some of it Russian.

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,870
Do you know what this is?

6
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,669
This is a list of electronic components
for a nuclear device.

7
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,831
- Hello.
- You have the package?

8
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:46,799
<i>- Not yet, but I'll have it soon.
- Call me when you have it.</i>

9
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,236
I don't wanna hurt you,
but I will unless you do exactly what I say.

10
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,710
There's a package in there. I'm supposed to
take it to a man who has an item for me.

11
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:58,430
When you pick up the item, you'll call me
and I'll give you further instructions.

12
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,873
There it is.

13
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,558
Walid, I'm so sorry I got you into this.

14
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:07,349
I deleted those files. It wasn't right
to arrest you for my actions.

15
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,716
- Don't touch me.
- Let him alone!

16
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,837
- Sir, get back in line.
- Not until you let go of that man.

17
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,839
- Mr President.
- What do you want?

18
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:23,310
You are holding 110 so-called enemy
combatants at your Palmdale military facility.

19
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:29,555
Have these freedom fighters on a nonmilitary
aircraft in the air by the end of the hour.

20
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,758
If you don't release them by the deadline,
the consequences will be devastating.

21
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:38,517
Jack, a nuclear device has been diverted
to a scientist with known terrorist ties.

22
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,591
Pulling up the file now.

23
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:46,396
- Do you recognise him?
- Yes. I saw him with Fayed a year ago.

24
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:50,234
- His name is Hasan Numair.
- We need to know where this man is now.

25
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,074
He's one of the terrorists being released
from Palmdale military prison.

26
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:58,833
<i>(man) Prisoner Numair, identify yourself now.</i>

27
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,835
<i>Sergeant, Numair is not on the plane.
Repeat, Numair is not on the plane.</i>

28
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,354
Hurry up. Fayed is waiting for you.

29
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,794
<i>- His escape was planned in advance.
- (man) I agree.</i>

30
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:22,158
Fayed's demand for the prisoners was a ploy.
He never intended for us to fly Numair out.

31
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,993
- He wanted him free inside our borders.
- That's right.

32
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,516
Do we know where along the route
Numair escaped?

33
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,194
After the highway.
He must've had inside help.

34
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,397
- Is there anyone unaccounted for?
- A sergeant is missing.

35
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,234
We're looking for him now.
I'll call you when I have more information.

36
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:42,598
- Chloe, what about satellite?
- We have coverage, but it's not continuous.

37
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:46,150
There are two tunnels and three locations
where coverage is partial.

38
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:50,950
Dammit. Numair is a known terrorist
with possible access to suitcase nukes

39
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,873
and he escapes in broad daylight.

40
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:58,636
We have to do better than we're doing
and we have to do it faster!

41
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:04,638
- What else do we know about Numair?
- He's a nuclear engineer trained in Germany.

42
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,748
Ran a weapons programme in Frankfurt.
Eight years ago he moved to the Middle East.

43
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,115
Is his training relevant to existing systems?

44
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:16,398
He knows it all and he's up to date. If he gets
his hands on the nuke, he can prep it on site.

45
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:21,270
I want this at the top of our list.
Capturing Numair is our number-one priority.

46
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,154
We won't be able
to set up satellite parameters.

47
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,390
Yeah, I know. I know.

48
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,278
Partition the grid.
Send half to me and half to Morris.

49
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,351
- Morris?
- Just do it. Morris.

50
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,352
<i>- (man) We haven't seen a thing.
- We're monitoring.</i>

51
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,432
As soon as I have anything new,
I will share it with you.

52
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,954
<i>- As soon as you do?
- Yes.</i>

53
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,031
What are you working on?

54
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:53,271
Setting up image processing
in the area where Numair escaped.

55
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,432
- Dobbins can do it. I need you.
- Now's not the time to pull rank.

56
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,512
Chloe's assigned me a task.
Please find somebody else.

57
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,750
OK.

58
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,435
- Chloe. What's Morris doing for you?
- What are you talking about?

59
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:09,399
- He said he's on task for you, but I need help.
- He's not doing anything for me.

60
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,878
- Is this ajoke?!
- You're upset.

61
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,394
Our alert level's high
and you're playing games.

62
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:20,314
If you can't work with me, then you quit!
The files are on your system.

63
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,392
- Filter them now.
- I will.

64
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:31,995
We assume there is a rogue nuclear weapon
on American soil, or there will be soon.

65
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,674
All agencies are to proceed
under that assumption.

66
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,832
- What are we dealing with, Karen?
- Suitcase nukes.

67
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:42,232
The term refers to a number of devices
manufactured by the former Soviet Union.

68
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,632
Small enough for one individual to carry
and they have a yield of one kiloton or less.

69
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,713
- Potential damage?
- The kill radius is about a half-mile.

70
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:56,193
The radiation greatly extends that radius,
depending on winds and weather conditions.

71
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:00,239
Let's just arrive at the point.
How many casualties are we talking about?

72
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,470
That depends on the population density.

73
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,757
In a crowded city,
many thousands would die instantly.

74
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,356
Taking the radiation into account,
the number of deaths and serious injuries

75
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,637
would multiply into
the hundreds of thousands.

76
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,915
Get me Jack Bauer... immediately.

77
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,192
- There's nothing here. We're wasting time.
- You keep saying "we".

78
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,398
There's you and there's us. There is no "we".

79
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:38,235
Give it a minute. Anything that isn't
incinerated could give us prints or trace DNA.

80
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,436
<i>(phone rings)</i>

81
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,315
<i>- Bauer.
- (woman) Hold for the president.</i>

82
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,435
<i>(beeping)</i>

83
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,557
<i>- Yes?
- Sir, Jack Bauer's on the line.</i>

84
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,200
<i>- Mr President.
- Jack.</i>

85
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,233
We're in the process of verifying what
Assad told you about his peace initiative.

86
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,914
Good. So far,
everything he's told us has been true.

87
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,152
- He's given us no reason to doubt him.
- I hope you're right.

88
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,949
I also want you to take charge
of the search for Fayed and Numair.

89
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:14,068
- Mr President, I...
- After the way the country treated you, I...

90
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,390
Well...

91
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:20,712
after the way that I treated you, I know
I don't have any right to ask you anything.

92
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,270
But you're on top of the situation
and I want to make it official.

93
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,917
Mr President, the truth is,
I don't think I'm up to it.

94
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,915
We are behind the curve, but if it weren't
for your efforts today, we'd be nowhere.

95
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,434
I need you to lead this search.

96
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,197
Then I'll do my best, sir.

97
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:47,270
Report to Bill Buchanan at CTU.
Call me anytime you think necessary.

98
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,033
- Yes, Mr President.
- Thank you.

99
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,992
The president wants me
to run the search for Fayed and Numair.

100
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:07,473
I can't do this without your help. I need you
to accept Assad as part of this investigation.

101
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,155
He knows these people.
He will see things you and I would miss.

102
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,470
He knows them because he's one of them.

103
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:17,155
Trust me. We need his help.

104
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:22,075
I can't believe I'm hearing this. Time was you
would've seen through this guy in a minute.

105
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,720
What did the Chinese do to you?

106
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,678
- Is there something you need to tell me?
- Like what?

107
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:32,878
Is there some kind of a history
between you and Assad?

108
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,678
<i>(Assad) Jack.</i>

109
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,320
- They found this.
- What is it?

110
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,551
It's a PDA damaged in the blast.
The message is still readable.

111
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,996
- What does it say?
- "Visitor arrived on Thursday".

112
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,311
"Visitor" couldn't be Numair.
He was still in custody then.

113
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,437
"Visitor" is a codeword within the cell.
It refers to "weapon".

114
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:54,513
- The suitcase nuke.
- Fayed must've received it last Thursday.

115
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:58,275
If they had the weapon then,
why get Numair out of prison now?

116
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,396
He must be key to making it operational.

117
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:04,075
Get everything packed up.
We need to go. Move.

118
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,830
Nothing is more important than finding
Fayed and Numair. You understand me?

119
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,393
Yeah.

120
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,878
<i>(phone rings)</i>

- Chloe, it's Jack. I need you to do something.

122

I want you to run a crosscheck
on Curtis Manning and Assad.

123
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,276
Is this important? I've got a lot on.

124
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:31,195
Curtis has a problem with Assad. It's
personal. I need to get them to work together.

125
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,714
I'll get it as soon as I can.

126
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,837
Numair is here.

127

- My brother.
- Fayed.

- I was starting to worry.
- Yes.

129
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:53,952
The escape went as planned, but I had to be
careful crossing the city. Where is it?

130
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:13,112
This was the last model the Soviets produced.
Where are the tools?

131
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,389
You're missing what I need to reprogram.

132

- The device will be here soon.
- By what means?

133
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,913
A young man named Ahmed.
A recent recruit, but reliable.

134
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:33,917
Ahmed, we have known you and your family
so long. I can't believe you want to do this.

135
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,549
It's not what I want to do,
it's what I have to do. I am a soldier.

136
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:41,792
You said your father knows nothing of this.
When he finds out, will he be proud?

deliver it anywhere until my family are safe.

146
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,757
- I'll release one of them.
- Both.

147
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:15,312
If I do that, I have no leverage and you
know it. Decide now. Which one do I release?

148
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:25,114
- My son. Release my son.
- I will release your wife.

149
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,113
- I just told you to release my son.
- You told me who you value most!

150
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,634
Your wife will call you when she's clear.

151
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,553
Deliver the component
and I will release your son.

152
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,949
That's it, Ray. Don't push your luck.

153
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,759
All right. All right, let her go.

154
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:47,437
Get in the car and drive.
Then call Ray and tell him you're all right.

155
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:51,513
This is the number that he called from.
Will you remember this?

156
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:55,752
- Yes.
- Good. Tell him to call when you're through.

157
00:10:55,840 --> 00:11:01,392
And understand that if I see any police,
I will shoot Scott. Do you understand?

158
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,232
I love you!

159

I don't know, but we cannot take the chance.

Look, I'm gonna deliver the package.

He already let you go, so we have to tell
ourselves he's got no reason to kill Scott.

Good. Take the package to 351 Old Mill Road,

A terrorist is holding my son hostage.
I need to speak to the police.

Dammit, I didn't want this tabbed.
I wanted it in tables.

181
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:25,236
I work much faster with tabs.
I thought that is what you'd want.

182

You're just being a pain in the ass.

- I just did. Get back to work.

This has got to stop. Everyone is extremely
busy and you two are distracting everyone.

00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:40,636
- Explain how to get him to follow directions.
- That's what you call this power trip?

186
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:45,032
OK, excuse me.
We all know what this is about.

187
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,636
Milo, you and I dated a couple of times
before Morris and I got back together.

188
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:54,157
We saw a couple of good movies,
but we agreed it wasn't really happening.

189
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,959
- Yeah.
- And you.

190
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,237
So I dated Milo a couple of times,
but I chose you.

191
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,196
Get over it and stop trying to beat him up.

192
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:07,353
- You think this is about my insecurities?
- Yeah. Isn't it?

193
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,638
No. OK, fine! If you want it in table format,
you'll get it in table format.

194
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:16,510
Let's just stop this mad terrorist guy before
he detonates a nuke on Wilshire Boulevard.

Thank you.

Sorry about that, mate.
And, just for the record,

there's no lingering jealousy about

Ms Wallace, this is Bill Buchanan.

Hello?

208
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,912
My name is Jack Bauer.
Your son is being held by a terrorist?

209
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,798
Yes, and he's forcing my husband
to deliver a package.

210
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,440
- What kind of package?
- I... I don't know.

211
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,511
There are other people involved.

212
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,273
- What's the name of the man with your son?
- Ahmed Amar.

213
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,239
- Did he mention any other names?
- Yes, one. Fayed.

214
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,552
Ma'am, how do we reach your husband?

215
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,756
You can't. He isn't carrying a cellphone.

216
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:21,389
- Do you know where he took the package?
- No. I'm sorry.

217
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:24,313
Whatever you do,
just don't let them hurt my son.

218
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,597
We're gonna do everything we can.
We'll get back to you.

219
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:34,514
- What do you think, Jack?
- She knew Fayed's name. What location?

220
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,795
Channing and Fifteenth, Granada Hills.

221
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,998
- Where's your nearest TAC team?
- You're as close as anybody. Take your team.

222
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,559
Copy that.

223
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:45,279
- Do we have a lead?
- Hostage in Granada Hills.

224
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,670
It might be connected to the bombings.
Go to Fifteenth and Channing.

225
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:54,153
- We can't take him on a tactical mission.
- We might need him when we get there.

226
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,358
All teams, proceed to
Fifteenth and Channing, Granada Hills.

227
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,878
- Mr President.
- It's good to see you, Mr Ambassador.

228
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,871
- And you, sir.
- Please, sit.

229
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,393
- How do you do?
- Karen Hayes.

230

- How do you do?
- Tom Lennox.

231
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:15,115
The events of these past few weeks
are deeply distressing for all of us.

232
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,714
If there's anything we can do to help, tell me.

233
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:21,509
You can help right now by having
a candid conversation with us.

234
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,272
I'm always candid.

235
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,353
Mr Ambassador, we've been in contact
with Hamri Al-Assad.

236
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,796
He has been the driving force
behind a number of terrorist attacks

237
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,270
around the country, around the world,
for the past two decades.

238
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:38,672
- I know who he is.
- Assad claims he's renounced terrorism.

239
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:43,311
He says he's willing to negotiate,
to use political means to gain his ends.

240
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:47,712
- Now, do you think he's telling the truth?
- I have reason to that believe he is.

241
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:52,430
How much influence does he have? Does he
speak for a large number of terrorist groups?

242
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:55,478
As you know, there are literally
hundreds of such groups.

243
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:59,075
Assad's reputation is such
that many of them, not all by any means,

244
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:02,835
but a substantial number,
would follow his lead at least for a while.

245
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:06,879
So this really could be
a significant step towards peace?

246
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,757
I sincerely hope so.

247
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,598
Thank you, Mr Ambassador.
You've been extremely helpful.

248
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:17,195
<i>- You're welcome, Mr President.
- (Tom) Mr Ambassador.</i>

249
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:22,597
So this corroborates everything
Jack told us about Assad.

250
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:27,037
We need to formalise our relationship
with him now, lock him into cooperation.

251
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:29,714
- Tom?
- I have a problem forming a partnership

252
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:34,828
with a man who is responsible
for the deaths of so many innocents.

253
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,389
- Is Assad still with Jack Bauer?
- Yes, sir.

254
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,869
Let's get Jack on the phone, please.

255
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,717
<i>(phone rings)</i>

256

257
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,633
<i>- Jack.
- Yes, Mr President?</i>

258
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,996
- Do we have leads on that nuclear weapon?
- We're following one.

259
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,150
It's too early to tell if it's meaningful.

260
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:03,598
All right. I just had a meeting that confirms
Assad is serious about negotiated peace

261
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:07,150
and that he does, in fact,
have the influence to make that happen.

262
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,708
I'd like to come to an arrangement.
Is he with you?

263
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,075
<i>- Yes, sir.
- Let me speak with him, please.</i>

264
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,957
One moment.

265
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,639
The president wants to speak to you.

266
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,232
Yes, Mr President?

267
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:26,599
I am prepared to offer you full protection
and a pardon for all crimes in the past.

268
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:30,514
There are conditions, however -
that you continue tracking Abu Fayed

269
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:34,434
and that you pledge your commitment
to a broader peace. Is that acceptable?

270
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:40,470
In principle, yes. Forgive me, Mr President,
but I need to see this in writing.

271
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,555
You'll have it within the hour.

272
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:50,995
- Let me speak with Jack, please.
- Of course.

273
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:57,233
- Yes, sir?
- This was not an easy thing to do.

274
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:01,757
I do believe the greater good requires it.
Do you agree?

275
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:05,988
I'm glad it's a call I didn't have to make, sir.

276
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,958
- Thank you, Jack.
- Yes, sir.

277
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:13,076
Your president, do you believe
he is an honourable man?

278
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,435
Yes, I do.

279
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:23,671
Mr Lennox, I have Sandra Palmer calling
for the president, but he's on another line.

280
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,991
Could you transfer that call
to my cellphone, please?

281
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:30,470
She specifically asked
to speak to the president.

282
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,551
And do it now, please.

283
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:37,192
<i>- (phone rings)
- Yes, Sandra? Tom Lennox here.</i>

284
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:41,319
- I need to speak with Wayne. It's important.
- The president's tied up.

285
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,914
Will you please let him know
I'm on the phone?

286
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,391
The president's asked not to be disturbed.
Does this concern your friend Walid?

287
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,631
Yes, that's exactly what it's about.
He's still in custody.

288
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:55,998
You continue to arrest innocent people,
you're giving the terrorists what they want.

289
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:00,676
The president is more concerned with the fate

- Of course not.
- Good.

- Who is this?
- He says Ahmed sent him.

316
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,637
- Your name?
- Ray Wallace. Ahmed should've called you.

317
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:45,192
You have to call Ahmed
and tell him to let my son go. We had a deal.

Is this what you need
to reprogram the trigger?

320
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,876
Yes. This should work.

321

- 20 minutes.

- Don't kill him... until you're ready to leave.

He still may be of some use as
a bargaining chip if something goes wrong.

Look, my... my son.

He's just a boy. Could you call Ahmed
and tell him to let him go?

- No.

It had to be. We don't have the time
to stand on ceremony.

Tom, I know you disapprove
of this agreement, but put it behind you.

351
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,037
The issue now is,
how do we position this with the public?

352
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:11,317
- It must be kept from the public.
- That's not practical.

353
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,472
It's to our advantage to make it known
Assad is on our side.

354
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:18,678
Don't disclose the formal agreement,
don't use the words "pardon" or "amnesty".

355
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,398
- We're cooperating.
- I agree.

356
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:25,270
Let's portray Assad as a man who's not
a terrorist, but someone who wants peace.

357
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:29,876
- Terrorist turned statesman.
- The point is saving lives. That's our focus.

358
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:33,316
OK, so for every life
that was lost in the past because of this man,

359
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:36,949
ten more may be saved in the future
by working with him.

360
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:39,429
On the face of it,
the logic is compelling.

361
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:43,115
Let's make a set of briefing points
and get them to our media people.

362
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,191
I'm on it.

363

I still don't like this.

your loyalty all the more, Tom.

365

we take the suspect alive.

Right now, he's our best chance of finding
the nuke. Slowly move into position now.

00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:57,239
What's going on?
Did my father deliver the package?

373
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,910
- Yes.
- Is he OK?

374
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,195
Did he do exactly what you told him?

375

Your father's fine.

376

So...

377
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:15,435

Why?

381
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,354
My father did exactly what you told him to do.

382
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:38,672
I swear... I promise you
I won't tell anybody what I know.

Absolutely, Bill. Good work.

They were speaking Arabic,
which I don't understand,

430
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,158

they used several times.

<i>"Khamsa ziwar".</i>

Pass that on to the FBI or somebody.

- Be careful.

439
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:40,553
I just got it. Thanks, Bill. Let me know
as soon as the TAC teams arrive in Valencia.

440
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,437
<i>Will do, Jack.</i>

441
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,879
This is everything
you and the president talked about.

442
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:56,078
You'll receive a full pardon in exchange for
continuing to help stop these attacks

443
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:59,948
and for bringing your political group
to a negotiated peace with the West.

444
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:02,793
- I need a moment to look through this.
- I understand.

445
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:07,590
Unfortunately, I need to get back to work.
Agent Boorman will take you to CTU.

446
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,360
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

447
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,071
Excuse me.

448
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:26,998
- What's the document?
- Come here.

449
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:34,478
I wanted to talk to you before it was executed.
I didn't think it would happen this fast.

450
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,949
- We made a deal with Assad.
- Who's "we"?

451
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:41,431
The United States government,
personally authorised by the president.

452
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:45,752
Assad will receive a pardon in exchange for
full cooperation, which he has given.

453
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,673
In other words, he walks.

454
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:51,991
Like I told the president, it's not my call.

455
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:58,315
It's not your call either. The responsibility
lies with him alone. It's out of our hands.

456
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,389
All right.

457
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:07,634
If that's the way it has to be...
that's the way it has to be.

458
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,669
Yeah.

459
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,358
<i>(Jillian) Scott. Scott.</i>

460
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,398
Oh, Scott. Oh, God. Are you all right?

461
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,549
- I'm fine.
- You sure?

462
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:22,234
- Yeah. Are you?
- Yes.

463
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,153
- Ms Wallace.
- Is there any word on my husband?

464
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:28,357
We think we know where he is.
We've got agents en route.

465
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,351
- Is he all right?
- I don't know.

466
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,635
We will do everything we can to protect him.

467
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,039
<i>(phone rings)</i>

468
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:36,759
Excuse me for one second. This is Bauer.

469
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,798
You were right about Curtis and Assad
having a connection.

470
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:43,350
- Go on.
- Curtis was in the army after Desert Storm.

471
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,749
His squad was ambushed by Assad's people.

472
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,912
<i>They killed five of Curtis's men
and took two hostage.</i>

473
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,560
Curtis was wounded.
He couldn't go after them.

474
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:54,598
<i>The next day, a tape was sent
to the television station.</i>

475
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:58,229
Assad's lieutenant forced
Curtis's men to beg for their lives

476
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,550
and then personally beheaded them both.

477
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,873
Oh, my God.

478
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,314
Jack?

479
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,550
Uh, I'll get back to you.

480
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:24,156
- Where's Agent Manning?
- He was here just a second ago.

481
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:29,913
Boorman, go ahead. I got him.

482
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:33,114
You still don't remember?

483
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:38,119
Special Forces Battalion,
32nd Support Group.

484
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:43,393
Curtis, put your weapon down!

485
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,149
I can't do that.

486
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:50,836
By order of the President of the United States,
put down your weapon!

487
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,749
- Stay out of this, Jack!
- I can't.

488
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:56,957
I gave him my word that
we would protect him.

489
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:00,874
- I didn't.
- Curtis, please. Don't do this.

490
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:06,989
Please.

491
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,268
I can't let this animal live.

492
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:26,071
<i>(phone rings)</i>

493
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,636
<i>- Yeah?
- Jack, it's Bill.</i>

494
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:38,236
Sprague told me what happened.
Curtis didn't leave you any choice.

495
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,949
<i>- That's what I keep trying to tell myself.
- You did the right thing.</i>

496
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:46,670
We need Assad alive. He's on his way back.
I think you should come in, too.

497
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:50,833
Tell the president that I'm sorry.
I can't do this any more.

498
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:54,799
The hell you can't. We're gonna find
that suitcase nuke because of you.

499
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,953
<i>- You've done great work today.
- Good. Then you don't need me any more.</i>

500
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:02,635
<i>I'll send a car for you, Jack.
Come back here. We'll talk.</i>

501
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,711
I'm done.

502
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:21,714
<i>(phone rings)</i>

503
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:24,836
Yes?

504
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:27,354
Mr Buchanan,
I received word that Ahmed Amar,

505
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:33,549
the terrorist who held the Wallace family
hostage, died en route to the hospital.

506
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,631
Thank you, Nadia.

507
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,960
- Mr Buchanan, the TAC team is ready.
- Patch me in.

508
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:51,635
Make sure the White House
is connected to the feed.

509
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,391
<i>(man) Watch your six.</i>

510
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,709
<i>Here.</i>

511
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,916
<i>Two, one side. Go, go.</i>

512
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,390
<i>(man #2) Delta Unit, move in.</i>

513
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,510
<i>(man) Delta moving in.</i>

514
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,118
<i>Watch it, watch it.</i>

515
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,712
<i>Engaged.</i>

516
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:46,238
- How much longer?
- Almost finished.

517
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,959
I just need to reconnect the fuse.

518
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,950
Sabir. I think I saw someone out there.

519
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,508
- Who?
- Police. Somebody. I saw something.

520
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,909
<i>(shouts in Arabic language) Are you done?</i>

521
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,194
Yes.

522
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,669
- Can you detonate now?
- Yes.

523
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,669
Do it now! Do it!

524
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,588
No!

525
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,791
Oh, my God.

526
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:02,235
Alert first-response teams in Los Angeles
and the surrounding counties.

527
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:06,677
Let's put them in touch with the military.
Tell them...

528
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:12,756
Tell them the resources of the entire nation
are at their disposal - whatever they need.

529
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,031
Karen?

530
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,191
Yes, Mr President.

531
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:42,151
Mr Buchanan,
I just got a message from the FBI.

532
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,550
They said it's important.
It's some Arabic phrase.

533
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:48,871
- What is it?
- It was overheard in a detention centre.

534
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:52,350
This phrase kept coming up.
I'm not sure about the pronunciation.

535
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,793
<i>"Khamsa ziwar".</i>

536
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,839
It means "five visitors".

537
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:02,435
Assad said "visitor"
was a codeword for "weapon".

538
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:05,956
There are four more of these things out there.

539
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,511
