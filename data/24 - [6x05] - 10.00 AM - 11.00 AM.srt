1
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,509
This was the last model the Soviets produced.

2
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,831
Is this what you need
to reprogram the trigger?

3
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:24,358
In less than an hour, it will detonate and strike
a blow that the Americans will never forget.

4
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,590
When you've finished,
meet me at the safe house.

5
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:31,710
I think some people in this place
have a connection with the terrorist attacks.

6
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,475
<i>- (Sandra) How would you know that?
- They used one phrase several times.</i>

7
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:39,030
<i>"Khamsa ziwar".
Pass that on to the FBI.</i>

8
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,356
I approved the agreement with Assad.

9
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,752
I am prepared to offer you full protection
and a pardon for all crimes in the past.

10
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,398
Is that acceptable?

11
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,391
<i>(Assad) I need to see this in writing.</i>

12
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:53,758
You were right about Curtis and Assad
having a connection. Curtis was in the army.

13
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,434
<i>His squad was ambushed by Assad's people.</i>

14
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,671
They killed five of Curtis's men
and took two hostage.

15
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,355
<i>Assad's lieutenant
personally beheaded them both.</i>

16
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,316
<i>(Jack) Oh, my God.</i>

17
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,868
You still don't remember?

18
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,071
Special Forces Battalion.

19
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,992
Curtis, put your weapon down!

20
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,435
- Stay out of this, Jack!
- I can't.

21
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,954
I gave him my word that
we would protect him.

22
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,634
I can't let this animal live.

23
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,076
<i>(Buchanan) Curtis didn't
leave you any choice.</i>

24
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,116
That's what I keep trying to tell myself.

25
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,475
We're gonna find that suitcase nuke
because of you.

26
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,917
Tell the president that I'm sorry.
I can't do this any more.

27
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:39,274
Mr President, we believe
we've found the suitcase nuke.

28
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,509
<i>(Chloe) TAC team is ready.</i>

29
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,558
<i>(Sabir) Do it now! Do it!</i>

30
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,988
No!

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,150
I just got a message from the FBI.

32
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,673
It's some Arabic phrase.

33
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,113
<i>"Khamsa ziwar".</i>

34
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,235
It means "five visitors".

35
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:06,676
Assad said "visitor"
was a codeword for "weapon".

36
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,320
There are four more of these things out there.

37
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:25,154
<i>The unthinkable has happened. Terrorists
have exploded a nuclear weapon on our soil.</i>

38
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:29,711
<i>Over one square mile of Valencia,
a suburb of Los Angeles, has been destroyed</i>

39
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:33,509
<i>by the most devastating attack
in the series of terrorist activities</i>

40
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,716
<i>that began 11 weeks ago.</i>

41
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:40,112
<i>And one can only imagine the cost in lives
and the suffering of survivors.</i>

42
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,034
<i>Judging from the direction in which
the mushroom cloud is heading,</i>

43
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:49,752
<i>winds may be blowing the airborne radiation
away from the more heavily populated areas.</i>

44
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,755
- How many people died in this?
- Initial estimates, no less than 12,000.

45
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,788
Mr President, I just got off the phone
with Bill Buchanan at CTU.

46
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:09,829
He has intel that four more nuclear weapons
were stolen along with the one that went off.

47
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:14,436
- Do we have any idea where they are?
- We do not.

48
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,432
- I want a meeting with the Joint Chiefs.
- I've told them.

49
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:21,433
- Has civilian air traffic been shut down?
- Yes. As soon as the FAA were informed.

50
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,793
Mr President.

51
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:29,351
Given the current situation, we've decided
to move you down to the bunker.

52
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,796
All right. But Tom, I have to
get in front of the American people.

53
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,235
I wanna make a televised speech
within the hour.

54
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,788
- Yes, sir.
- All right, let's go down.

55
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:58,833
<i>The Department of Emergency Services and
Public Safety urges everyone to return home.</i>

56
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:02,310
<i>We will have an expert in nuclear physics
on our programme...</i>

57
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,359
Have we heard from any of the secondary
teams that were converging on Fayed?

58
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,670
We lost communication
as soon as the blast hit.

59
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,799
- Milo, can you get a visual?
- I just checked the satellite. All...

60
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:17,476
All of our field teams were too close
to ground zero. They're all dead.

61
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,633
- What was the last you heard?
- They had engaged the hostiles.

62
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,918
So they were closing in on Fayed. We need
to know if he was in the bomb's radius.

63
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,228
Absolutely.

64
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,879
Mr President, your office has been prepared.

65
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,758
Continuity of operations plan
has also been activated.

66
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,912
The vice president has been alerted
and is following protocol.

67
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,515
The Joint Chiefs and most of the cabinet
are on their way here.

68
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:45,276
The remaining cabinet members
are being routed to Site R.

69
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,551
Right this way, sir.

70
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,195
<i>(phone rings)</i>

71
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,238
- Yeah?
- Bill? Are you all right?

72
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,470
We're fine. What's going on over there?

73
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,519
We've moved to the bunker. The president
is about to meet with the Joint Chiefs.

74
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,875
Do you have anything new?

75
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,474
The bomb went off
as we were moving in on Fayed.

76
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,630
Do you think that prompted the detonation?

77
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:22,794
It could have. It's possible they were hoping
to move the bomb to a more populated area.

78
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:27,032
Is there any chance that Fayed could still
be alive and have those four other bombs?

79
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,749
- We don't know. We're running the intel now.
- And what about Assad?

80
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,912
He's on his way here.
We're hoping he can help us find Fayed.

81
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,151
Keep me in the loop.
And Bill, please, be careful.

82
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,798
I will.

83
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,513
It's a lot to process.

84
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,431
So many people.

85
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,078
Yeah.

86
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,958
And Curtis? I can't believe this.

87
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,634
I know you and he were friends.

88
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,439
Why do people I know keep dying?

89
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:07,232
- Did you find anything out about Fayed?
- No, we're still positioning satellites.

90
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,309
<i>(sighs)</i>

91
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,517
We've got massive packet loss.
Do you wanna help boot up routers?

92
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,795
Who wouldn't?

93
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,750
- Open Études Five.
- OK.

94
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,473
I just have a really bad feeling
about everything.

95
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,312
Did you know Jack quit?

96
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,868
Yeah, Buchanan said.
What's that all about?

97
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:32,556
I'm sure it's because
he was forced to kill Curtis.

98
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,270
You know I'm here for you, right?

99
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,351
Yeah, I do.

100
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,797
<i>(people shouting)</i>

101
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,397
<i>- (woman) We need help!
- Keep going. Keep going.</i>

102
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:00,196
<i>(man) Ma'am, we're doing the best we can.</i>

103
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,316
Over here!

104
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:18,914
They discovered our location.
The bomb never reached its target.

105
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:25,037
I sold you the weapons. You could've warned
me before you blew them up in my city!

106
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,750
- It wasn't supposed to happen the way it did.
- A little late for apologies, don't you think?

107
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:34,550
My engineer died in the blast. The device
used to reprogram the trigger was destroyed.

108
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,709
That's my problem?

109
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,031
I have four more bombs whose triggers
need to be made operational.

110
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,917
Sorry, Fayed.

111
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,992
- I'm going to Vegas.
- Find me a way, McCarthy.

112
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:48,991
I'll pay you more. Double the amount
from our previous transaction.

113
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,593
That's interesting.

114
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:55,472
You need someone who can replicate
what that device did, with modern equipment.

115
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,358
That's advanced stuff.
I'd have to do some checking.

116
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,159
Do you know someone who can do this?

117
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,357
Even if I found someone who can,
I doubt they will.

118
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:09,434
I don't care how you get them to comply.
I need someone within the next few hours.

119
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,033
Are you in or not?

120
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,759
I'll do some research and get back to you.

121
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:30,514
Help! Somebody help!
Look, I-I-I can't get through to 911.

122
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,794
Would you help? I need a doctor.
I need a doctor. I need a doctor.

123
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,634
<i>- (woman) Get out of my way!
- I need a doctor. Our helicopter went down.</i>

124
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:43,157
There are two others. One's dead,
one's unconscious. Please, please help me.

125
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,231
I'm sorry. Show me.

126
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:54,557
I don't remember anything hitting us.
Itjust went out of control.

127
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,996
- You were hit by a shock wave.
- A shock wave of what?

128
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,038
- A nuclear bomb.
- What?

129
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,475
What are you talking about?

130
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,511
Can you hear me? Can you hear me?

131
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,113
Chuck, is that you?

132
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,509
Yeah, I brought help.
We're gonna get you out.

133
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:36,070
- Be careful, it's about to fall.
- It's jammed.

134
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:59,397
Ready? One, two, three.

135
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,118
Go!

136
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,671
Stay here.

137
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,515

- I think so.

- That's Valencia. That's where I live.

140
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:35,035
- My wife and kids are there. I gotta get them.
- You can't. The radiation will kill you.

<i>- This is Bauer. Let me speak to Buchanan.
- Right away.</i>

You wanna save your friend,
don't let him go home.

<i>- (Buchanan) You all right?

- Where are you?
- I'm still in Granada Hills.

146

You're upwind. Don't go any further north.

147

<i>- How bad is it?
- It took out a square mile.</i>

148

- Do we know if this was Fayed's endgame?
- It wasn't. There are four more nukes.

00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,719
- You need to pick me up.
- You said you were out.

150
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:03,877
- Not after this.
- Tell me where you are, I'll send a car.

151
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:08,351
<i>- I'm on the corner of Glasgow and Fifteenth.
- We'll be there.</i>

152
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:30,075
Fayed has to be at least partially state
supported. Have you identified a country?

153
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:35,029
Not yet, sir. CIA's narrowed down a list.
It's on your screen in the short brief section.

154
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,873
Have you contacted
the ambassadors of these countries?

155
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:43,318
They all extend their condolences, and have,
of course, disavowed any role in the attacks.

156
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:47,712
Well, we know at least one of them's lying.
Maybe all of them.

157
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:53,238
I'm not sure we know that, John. But let's say
it is true. What are you suggesting?

158
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:56,118
We have carriers on standby
in the Persian Gulf

159
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,670
capable of striking multiple targets
in each of these states.

160
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,230
We've been playing games
with these terrorists for 11 weeks now.

161
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:07,632
The only language they understand is force,
so let's speak it to them real clearly.

162
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:12,669
I guarantee if these countries had to sustain
three major metropolitan nuclear strikes,

163
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:16,309
they'd no longer have the time
or the resources to play in our sandbox.

164
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:20,234
If these people wanna live in the Stone Age,
I say let's put them there.

165
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:25,633
I am very sure your emotions are shared by
many in this room and across this country...

166
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,790
It's notjust emotions. Duty demands...

167
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:32,715
The president is talking, Admiral.
Do not interrupt.

168
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,439
We will retaliate, Admiral.
But we will do so, sir, carefully,

169
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:42,832
and with our sights locked on our enemy
and only our enemy.

170
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,320
What has CTU learned
about the remaining weapons?

171
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:49,517
They're assessing
the satellite intel and forensic data.

172
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,158
So what do we know?

173
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:55,028
We're assuming the bomb was meant
to be detonated in a more populated area

174
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,351
and was only being assembled in Valencia.

175
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:03,833
- By the scientist that I released?
- Yes. The scientist was killed in the blast.

176
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,276
And CTU is trying to determine
where Fayed was at the time.

177
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:12,878
The worst-case scenario is that he is still alive
and has the remaining nuclear weapons.

178
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,669
Tell them we're safe.

179
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,032
That we're moving away from it now.

180
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:50,036
Mr Buchanan, this is Hamri Al-Assad.

181
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,793
Mr Buchanan's the director of CTU.

182
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,759
Mr Buchanan, I know that
you see me as your enemy,

183
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,195
but today, I assure you I am not.

184
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,671
Follow me.

185
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,469
There. All right?

186
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:27,078
Why are we treating Assad, one of the most
violent terrorists of our time, like a VIP?

187
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:30,232
No holding room.
Audience with the White House? Sure.

188
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,393
How would you like your mineral water,
Mr Assad? Room temp?

189
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,191
Please have a seat.

190
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,758
Ready?

191
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:01,231
Bill Buchanan, director of CTU Los Angeles.
I'm here with Hamri Al-Assad.

192
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:05,313
Less than 30 minutes ago Abu Fayed
detonated a nuclear weapon in Los Angeles.

193
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:09,154
We believe he's still at large
with four more tactical nuclear weapons.

194
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,629
- Four?
- That's right.

195
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:16,510
Please, you must understand,
I came to the United States to stop Fayed.

196
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,149
I knew he intended to damage,
but not that he had nuclear weapons.

197
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:26,554
There has to be a trail. There had to have been
many people involved in the planning of this.

198
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:29,473
It was planned after
Fayed betrayed me six months ago.

199
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:34,111
- When he learned of your peace plan.
- Which I still intend to broker.

200
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,835
But you knew Fayed was coming to the US.

201
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,718
This information came
only days before the attacks began.

202
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:45,078
- From whom?
- I'm a well-informed man, Mr Buchanan.

203
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:49,431
Are there any other paths
that can lead us to Fayed?

204
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:53,274
- Yes. The source.
- The source of the bomb?

205
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,318
A year ago, I sent Fayed to negotiate
with an ex-Soviet general

206
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:00,473
about tactical nuclear weapons,
but there was no transaction at the time.

207
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,438
- What was the name of the general?
- Dmitri Gredenko.

208
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:08,435
- Can you tell me anything about Gredenko?
- Nothing. Nothing. I've never met the man.

209
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:12,593
Continue questioning him.
I'm gonna check this out.

210
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:16,195
- Gredenko. You got that?
- I'm opening a Russian database now.

211
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,271
Let me know what you find out.

212
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:36,556
- What about this with Gredenko's name on?
- It's a link we're using as a match basis.

213
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:39,029
- No, I understand that...
- Hey, hey, hey.

214
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:45,116
I just compiled a list of people in LA who've
had contact with Gredenko on business.

215
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,430
- That's a lot of names.
- Yes.

216
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:52,479
But one of them kind of floated to the top,
if you know what I mean.

217
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,949
Put it on Buchanan's screen.

218
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,033
Wow.

219
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,918
<i>- (woman) Sir, have you arranged it?
- Yes, they'll fly him up.</i>

220
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,877
<i>- I'll let them know.
- All right.</i>

221
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:08,555
Morris just put something on your B window.

222
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,036
Gredenko contacts. Good.

223
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,429
Look at number 17.

224
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,830
Chairman of BXJ Technologies.

225
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,558
Phillip Bauer.

226
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,829
Jack's father.

227
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:28,512
- Did you get anything more specific?
- No. BXJ does business in Eastern Europe.

228
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,672
- This could be a purely coincidental link.
- What if it's not?

229
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,558
Their contracts are confidential,
but I'll look into it.

230
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,029
- You calling Jack?
- Yeah.

231
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,039
<i>- This is Bauer.
- Jack.</i>

232
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:45,591
Assad gave us the name of a Russian general
Fayed contacted a year ago about the nukes.

233
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,672
- General Gredenko. Do you know him?
- No.

234
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,239
It turns out your father does.

235
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,515
My father? Are you sure?

236
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:58,752
Gredenko did business with BXJ
Technologies specifically with your father.

237
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:02,594
- What kind of business?
- We don't know. We wanna talk to him.

238
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,716
Is my father a suspect?

239
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:08,713
No, his name came up on a list of people
who have had contact with Gredenko.

240
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:12,429
We're gonna question him.
I wanted to see if you could shed any light.

241
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,715
I haven't spoken to him for nine years.

242
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,070
We'll send someone to talk to him.

243
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,230
Bill, wait.

244
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,958
I should do this.

245
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,918
- Jack, we can run this.
- You don't have enough time.

246
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,389
He'll talk to me if I go alone.

247
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,908
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

248
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:36,032
Tell Stokes we'll pick him up.
You take the car.

249
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,111
Thanks, Bill.

250
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,750
You need to pull over.

251
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,834
<i>- (woman) Is he still there?
- Yes, he is. But I don't know exact...</i>

252
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,592
The FBI's here. I gotta go.

253
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,948
- Why did they send you?
- I didn't want to arrest you or your friend.

254
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:02,708
This is Agent Jennings.
He'll be working this with me.

255
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:07,271
- What exactly will you be doing?
- Walid heard conversations about the bombs.

256
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,396
He heard a fragment of a conversation.

257
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:14,270
If there is an active cell inside that detention
facility, we need Walid to find out more.

258
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,635
Agent Jennings will be putting a wire on him.

259
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:21,032
Putting a wire on him? I thought you were
replacing him with an undercover operative.

260
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,716
- Walid isn't trained to do something like this.
- He's already in place.

261
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:29,190
He's established a confidence.

262
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:34,274
- How will you be putting a wire on him?
- Just let us do ourjob.

263
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:54,399
Have you heard anything more?

264
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:58,358
- About what?
- Like what's going on out there.

265
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:02,749
- Well, how would I know that?
- I thought...

266
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,997
I was just wondering if you knew anything.

267
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,152
<i>- No more than you, my brother.
- (speaks Arabic language)</i>

268
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,554
- I'm sorry, I have to get back.
- Sure.

269
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,239
Walid Al-Rezani.

270
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,470
- Yes?
- You and I have to talk.

271
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:28,632
- About what?
- You don't ask the questions, son of a bitch.

272
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,517
I do.

273
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,189
Get out. Get out!

274
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:51,269
- We know who you're involved with.
- I told you people, I work for the IAA.

275
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,591
- I'm not involved in any terrorist activities.
- You're lying!

276
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,796
- I'm no terrorist!
- You're lying!

277
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,474
<i>- (Walid groans)
- What's he doing to him?</i>

278
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:02,677
Don't worry, he's not going to hurt him.
It's just for show.

279
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:06,992
- That doesn't sound like it's just for show.
- Ms Palmer, I advised you to leave.

280
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:10,959
If you wanna stay,
keep your comments to yourself.

281
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,952
- Explain what was in your wallet.
- What are you talking about?

282
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,634
You know damn well
what we're talking about!

283
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,314
He's wiring you. It's a two-way radio.

284
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,029
Now you're gonna tell me what we found
in your wallet. Understand?

285
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:29,510
<i>- What do you know about this guy? Huh?
- (Walid groans)</i>

286
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,719
- This is ridiculous.
- Sit down.

287
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:37,990
Tell me or I'll take you to the
interrogation room. You don't want that.

288
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,516
- I don't care what you do to me.
- You will!

289
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:46,754
You're gonna say that I asked about this man.
Make them believe you're working with him.

290
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,309
I'll be back for you!

291
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,958
- What did they do to you?
- Nothing.

292
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:05,031
I'm fine.

293
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:09,836
They think they can do anything to us,
those bastards.

00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,388

<i>- Hello?
- Sam, is that you?</i>

297
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,078
Yes. Who's this?

298
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,594
- It's Jack.
- Jack?

299
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,317
- How are you, Sam?
- We thought you were...

300
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,868
<i>- Where are you calling from?
- I'm in Los Angeles.</i>

301
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:41,589
I need to speak to my father.
It's really important. Is he there?

302
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,830
<i>- No, he's not.
- Where is he?</i>

303
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:47,435
He left yesterday without saying where
he was going. I haven't heard from him.

304
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,398
- Can I reach him on his cell?
- He left it here.

305
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:56,669
I must admit it's all a bit mysterious. I tried
calling your brother. He didn't know either.

306
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:00,435
<i>- Where is Gray?
- He was at work earlier, but who knows now.</i>

307
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:08,029
- Can I get his cell number?
- Yeah. 818-555-0175.

308
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:14,838
If you speak to my father, tell him to get back
to me. Did my number show on your screen?

309
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,831
- Yes.
- It's really important.

310
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:22,839
I hope you find your father soon.
I know he would wanna talk to you.

311
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:26,799
<i>He regrets the way things ended
between the two of you.</i>

312

<i>- (Jack) Yeah, me too.
- (Sam) Be well, Jack.</i>

313
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,990
<i>(Jack) Thanks, Sam.</i>

<i>(man) Yeah?</i>

316
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,872
It's Liddy. You'll never guess
who just called here.

317
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:46,520
<i>- Who?
- Your brother Jack.</i>

318
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:49,433
Jack's rotting away in some Chinese prison.

319
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,351
No, actually he's here in LA.

320
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,795
<i>- How the hell did that happen?
- I don't know.</i>

321
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:57,429
- What's he want?
- He's looking for the old man.

322
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,431
- Why?
- He didn't say, but...

323
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:03,752
if I were you, I'd expect a call from Jack.
Your name came up.

324
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:07,196
We should've killed Jack
instead of handing him to the Chinese.

325
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,032
We tried.

326
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:14,831
This isn't good. My brother has a way
of digging things up that need to stay buried.

327
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:33,113
<i>(phone rings)</i>

328
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,794
<i>- Hello.
- It's me. Jack.</i>

329
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,869
Jack?

330
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,236
Yeah.

331
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:42,153
Sam said you called, but I didn't believe him.
Are you OK?

332
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:47,075
- Yeah, I'm fine. Is everyone safe over there?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, we're cool, Jack. Wow!

333
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,549
It's blowing my mind hearing from you.

334
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:55,510
When Dad and I found out that you were
in China, we tried everything to get you out.

335
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,830
<i>- Thanks.
- Yeah. How did you get out?</i>

336
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,391
- Some sort of exchange.
- For what?

337
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,075
- I'm not really sure.
- It must've been one hell of an exchange.

338
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:07,277
I'm working with CTU,
trying to help them with something.

339
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,432
Yeah, Sam said that
you were trying to find Dad.

340
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:13,990
- Yeah. Where is he?
- I don't know. He took off yesterday.

341
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:18,358
I assume he went to visit one of his
girlfriends. One of 'em's really kind of hot.

342
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:22,479
- Why'd he leave without his cellphone?
- I guess he didn't want to be bothered.

343
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:25,711
Gray, I need your help.
I need to find him. It's important.

344
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:29,429
Whatever you need. I'll make a few calls.
Can I get back to you at this number?

345
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,795
<i>- Yeah.
- OK. You got it.</i>

346
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:32,869

<i>- Your brother?
- Yeah.</i>

352
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,989
It should be in my family file.

353
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,190
I haven't seen him in years.
Is he still in Malibu?

354
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:59,559
No, he's in Indian Falls. 226 Pinecrest Road.
Do you want his cellphone number?

355
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,551
No, I already have it. I just talked to him.

356
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,595
Why didn't you ask him where he lives?

357
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:09,069
I'll get back to you.

- Yeah. They're talking about nuclear fallout.

363
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:35,557
We'll be fine. In a weird way,
we're actually safer now.

364
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:39,997
They've made their big show in LA with this
nuke. Next, I'm sure it'll be in another city.

00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,718

All right.

368

I just got off the phone with my brother Jack.

00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,111
Jack? How? I thought
the Chinese were holding him.

370
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,919
He's back in Los Angeles.

371
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,831
That's impossible.

372
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:09,832
Apparently not. He's looking for Dad.

373
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:14,759
- Is he coming here?
- Why? Are you hoping he will?

374
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:15,829
Don't go there.

375
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:21,358
I'm looking for a little honesty. You weren't
over Jack when we married. You're still not.

376
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:26,753
OK, how's this for a little honesty:
insecurity in a grown man is not attractive.

377
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,274
"The latest terrorist incident"?

378
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:42,433
This was a nuclear bomb.
Can we call it what it is?

379
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:47,753
It gives the president more flexibility. Use the
word nuclear and they'll hear nothing else.

380
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,796
No, they will hear the truth.

381
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,269
Everybody in this country
knows what happened,

382
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:57,798
and they want reassurances that no matter
how ugly this is, the president is in charge.

383
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:02,510
Listen, we don't have any tangible leads
and confidence is low.

384
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:07,116
Now, if I go out there and lie to the American
public and tell them we're on top of this,

385
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:12,228
then another bomb goes off somewhere, they
won't believe a word I say. That can't happen.

386
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:15,039
I agree, sir, and that's why
I see an opportunity.

387
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,314
Opportunity?

388
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:21,190
This bomb removes any remaining doubt that
we should take more aggressive measures.

389
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:24,511
Suspension of certain freedoms,
internment, deportation.

390
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,795
Now is the time to hit those topics.

391
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,270
Tom, you are counselling
that we embrace the politics of fear.

392
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:33,875
I am saying that we embrace reality.
We are afraid.

393
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:37,111
But if fear consolidates public support

394
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:42,957
for measures that save our nation from
extinction, then you bet I'm in support of fear.

395
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:46,919
Tom, the people cannot be
any more afraid than they are now.

396
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,468
I'd like this message to have a calming effect.

397
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:52,836
We will call this a nuclear bomb,
because that is what it is.

398
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:57,875
But if we expect civil order on those streets,
we cannot stoke the panic.

399
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:00,155
We're not gonna mention policy.

400
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,630
The American public just needs to know
that this administration

401
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:09,511
is working with the sole purpose of restoring
order and making our streets safe again.

402
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:14,915
I don't need a list of names,
I need one person who can do the job.

403

Why couldn't you have
picked me up at my place?

407
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,954
Instead of leaving me on some
street corner looking like some hooker.

408
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,235
Just get in the car.

00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:44,198
Do not... talk to me...

410

like one of your bimbos, you got me?

411
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,960
They just said on the news...

412
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:56,073
that if the wind changes, we're screwed.

413
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:02,078
I just wanna get out of the city
and get to Vegas.

414

We're not going to Vegas.

415
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:07,593
Oh, no, I'm not going to Palm Springs. Again.

416
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:11,958
Just drop me off right here. That place
is like assisted living for an entire city.

417
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:16,192
We're not going there either.
We have some things we gotta do here first.

418
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:21,718
What are you talking about? A nuclear bomb
just went off, like, 25 miles from here.

419
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:24,951
- I'm talking about a lot of money. Shut up.

someone to do your dirty work.

- The money is ready now.

McCarthy will find someone for us. Tell the
men these bombs go off today as scheduled.

I finished with Assad. He gave me a few more
names, but nothing he thought would help.

You believe him?

00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,157
Yeah.

431
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:35,311
The president would like you
transported to Washington, DC.

432

Good luck here in Los Angeles.
I hope the worst is over.

Thank you.

They're sending us live audio.

- They got a guy wearing a wire at Anacostia.

One of the detainees may have
information about Fayed.

Give it to Chloe, make it a priority.

<i>(in Arabic language)</i>

441
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:47,275
- Walid should not be doing this.
- He'll be OK.

442
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,909
- That is not the point.
- It was his decision, and it was the right one.

443
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,391
Usually it takes weeks to develop a cover. He
might be able to find something within hours.

444
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:58,233
If this works, he'll have done an heroic thing.

445
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:01,392
Please, don't give me speeches, OK?
"If it works"?

446
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:04,074
What if it doesn't
and they find out he's wearing a wire?

447
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:07,470
- Guards inside are keeping an eye on him.
- Right.

448
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:11,269
- It's not the best thing that you're here.
- Walid is my client...

449
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:15,558
I know what you told me, and frankly
that carries no weight with the FBI.

450
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:19,838
Let's be honest, the only reason you're here
is you're the president's sister.

451
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,753
Then you remember that and we'll be fine.

452
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,470
You have no trouble bending the rules
when it's to your advantage, do you?

453
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:30,279
<i>(Salim speaks in Arabic language)</i>

454
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:34,158
What did they want with you?

455
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,036
I shouldn't bring you into this.

456
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:40,032
It's all right. You can talk to me.

457
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,676
I heard the guard say
he found something in your wallet.

458
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:50,151
- Yeah, they confiscated it.
- What was it? What did he find?

459
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,991
A phone number.

460
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:55,071
Whose?

461
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:07,632
Listen to me, if you and I are in the same
situation here, we should know each other.

462
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:16,271
- Talk to me.
- Maybe I shouldn't have gotten involved.

463
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:19,750
- I met some people through my organisation.
- What organisation?

464
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:22,718
The IAA. I'm Regional Director.

465
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,313
Go on.

466
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:29,918
Most of what we do has no... teeth. I was
introduced to a man who was more active.

467
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,719
- I wanted to help him.
- That's good.

468
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:37,669
We set up a meeting,
but before I had a chance, I was grabbed.

469
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,915
Who is this person?

470
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,191
Abu Fayed.

471
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,311
You know him?

472
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:50,434
No.

473
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,594
But please, join us, brother.

474
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:09,511
- He did that well.
- What happens now?

475
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:14,549
He's going to have to sell himself
to the others before they open up.

476
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,352
<i>(doorbell)</i>

477
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:28,032
Jack! Uh, I didn't know
that you were coming here.

478
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:31,590
- We need to talk.
- Yeah, sure. Yeah. Come on in.

479
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:39,355
Man, Jack, it's good to see you.
Good to see you.

480
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,389
<i>(clears throat) Um...</i>

481
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,516
- You've never been here, have you?
- No.

482
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:48,319
God, when was the last time
we saw each other?

483
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,154
- When Teri died.
- That's right, at the funeral.

484
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:55,630
- Have you found Dad yet?
- No. I made some calls, but so far nothing.

485
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,995
Hey, Josh, come here.

486
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:02,835
Josh, this is your Uncle Jack. You two
have not seen each other in a long time.

487
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,519
- Hey.
- Hi, Josh.

488
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:13,319
- How you doin'?
- OK, I guess.

489
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,994
It's kind of been a weird day.

490
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:18,913
<i>- Yeah, I know.
- (mother) Josh.</i>

491
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,195
Give your father some privacy.

492
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:29,918
<i>- (Josh) Maybe we can talk later.
- I would like that.</i>

493
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:41,556
I'm sorry for the intrusion. I just need some
information about our father, then I'll leave.

494
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:51,148
Well, that was pleasant, wasn't it?
Come on, let's go to my office.

495
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:07,069
- Have a seat.
- I'm fine.

496
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:10,357
OK. So what are we doing here, Jack?

497
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:14,672
Our father did business with an ex-Russian
general named Gredenko. Do you know him?

498
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:17,991
Um... no, it must be one of the old guard.

499
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,031
We can't believe
the drinking buddies Dad's cultivated.

500
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:25,430
There was one time we were
down in Venezuela, this was before...

501
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,431
Gray.

502
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:31,911
I didn't come here to listen to your stories.
I'm serious. I need to find Dad.

503
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:37,916
OK, we will. Boy, Jack, you could neverjust
walk into a room and get along, could you?

504
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,958
I mean, I know you must've
gone through hell in China,

505
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:45,795
but look at the bright side,
you got out, you're here. Just relax a little.

506
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:30,830
If you try and raise your voice,
I will rip your tongue out. Are we clear?

507
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:34,799
Gray, people in this country are dying,
and I need some information.

508
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,599
Are you gonna give it to me,
or do I have to hurt you?

509
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:42,356
- Actually, you're hurting me now.
- Trust me, I'm not.

510
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,714
<i>(knock at door)</i>

511
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,076
- The speech is in the Teleprompter.
- With the latest changes?

512
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,435
Yes, sir.

513
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,158
OK.

514
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:06,078
Are you all right, sir?

515
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,153
I can't let the American public
see how scared I am.

516
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:13,435
No, you cannot.

517
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:19,516
But we got hit by a nuclear bomb. Bravado
would be no more appropriate than fear.

518
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,833
Thank you, Tom.

519
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,638
My fellow Americans,

520
00:39:56,200 --> 00:40:02,150
there is no easy way to say the words,
"America has been hit by a nuclear weapon".

521
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:05,118
But, as you know, this is now a fact.

522
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:10,354
The question remains, what do we,
as a country, as a people, do about it?

523
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:13,830
How do we rationalise
the fear and sorrow that each of us feels?

524
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:17,799
Do we let our anger
guide us down a dangerous path?

525
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:20,348
Or do we come together,

526
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:25,389
continuing to show courage and strength
in the face of our enemy?

527
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:28,597
This horrible act of evil
which has struck our great nation

528
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:31,353
is the cowardly action of barbaric men.

529
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,958
Say one more thing I don't wanna hear,
and this will hurt.

530
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,508
- What do you want from me?
- The truth!

531
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:41,798
That is the truth!
I swear to you on my family's life.

532
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,990
Not good enough.

533
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:57,831
You brought this on yourself.

534
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,951
