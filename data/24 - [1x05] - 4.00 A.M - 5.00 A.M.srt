1
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,151
Excuse me. Hello?

2
00:03:12,999 --> 00:03:14,318
Hello?

3
00:03:14,399 --> 00:03:16,674
Hello? Excuse me. Hello?

4
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:22,955
Excuse me. There was
a teenage girl in an accident.

5
00:03:23,438 --> 00:03:26,986
- A teenage girl in a traffic accident.
- I'll be right with you.

6
00:03:27,077 --> 00:03:32,833
- We just called. There was a traffic accident.
- Certainly. You have our fax number?

7
00:03:32,917 --> 00:03:35,669
- Excuse me.
- Thank you. You're welcome.

8
00:03:35,756 --> 00:03:38,953
Doctor, did you get the message
about the heart seminar?

9
00:03:39,035 --> 00:03:41,026
- Yes, I did.
- There was a car accident.

10
00:03:41,115 --> 00:03:44,470
- Sorry. My shift starts at four. I just got here.
- Please help me.

11
00:03:44,555 --> 00:03:47,466
- A teenage girl, traffic accident.
- The name?

12
00:03:48,314 --> 00:03:52,670
- Kimberly Bauer or Janet York.
- B-a-u-e-r. Y-o-r-k.

13
00:03:56,993 --> 00:03:59,267
No name listed. Just a Jane Doe.

14
00:04:00,272 --> 00:04:02,911
- Well, maybe...
- Hey! You can't go in there!

15
00:04:10,631 --> 00:04:13,383
Oh, my God. Janet.

16
00:04:22,748 --> 00:04:24,739
I'm sure you're gonna find Kim.

17
00:04:31,908 --> 00:04:33,545
- Hello.
- Honey, it's me.

18
00:04:33,627 --> 00:04:35,538
Jack, I've been trying to reach you.

19
00:04:35,626 --> 00:04:38,857
- Have you found Kim yet?
- No. We're at St Mark's Hospital.

20
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:42,143
- Hospital?
- Kim's friend, Janet, was in a car accident.

21
00:04:42,226 --> 00:04:44,581
- And Kim?
- I don't know. She tried to call me.

22
00:04:44,665 --> 00:04:47,055
She was in a panic, like she was in trouble,

23
00:04:47,145 --> 00:04:49,705
and I tried to get her,
but we were stopped by a cop...

24
00:04:49,785 --> 00:04:52,173
Teri, Teri, Teri, calm down.

25
00:04:52,264 --> 00:04:55,175
- I'm losing my mind. I need you here.
- I know, sweetheart.

26
00:04:55,264 --> 00:04:59,381
I'm gonna get there as soon as I can. Where
was Kim when she called the second time?

27
00:04:59,464 --> 00:05:02,978
I... I don't know. She was... uh...

28
00:05:03,062 --> 00:05:06,135
North Hollywood.
It sounded like she was being chased,

29
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:08,894
and then when we got there, she was gone.

30
00:05:08,982 --> 00:05:12,610
- Kim's friend, Janet. Let me speak to her.
- She's in surgery.

31
00:05:12,701 --> 00:05:15,499
Surgery? Is she gonna make it?

32
00:05:15,581 --> 00:05:17,890
- I don't know.
- Listen to me, Teri.

33
00:05:17,981 --> 00:05:20,335
What I'm trying to do
right now is to find Kim.

34
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:23,412
Stay where you are,
and I will get there as soon as I can.

35
00:05:23,499 --> 00:05:28,129
What do you mean? I've been trying to find
Kim. I've been out all night trying to find Kim.

36
00:05:28,219 --> 00:05:33,133
Teri, I'm gonna explain it to you later, OK?
You're gonna have to trust me.

37
00:05:33,218 --> 00:05:35,857
Teri? Honey, I love you.

38
00:05:37,217 --> 00:05:40,209
I promise you,
we're gonna get through this, OK?

39
00:05:41,337 --> 00:05:43,453
I love you too, Jack.

40
00:05:43,536 --> 00:05:46,369
I'll get back to you
as soon as I know anything.

41
00:06:02,174 --> 00:06:06,405
Yeah, she's here. They say
the other one's dead. Don't worry. I will.

42
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:12,007
OK. Change of plan. Drive to the compound.
You'll get your money there.

43
00:06:12,092 --> 00:06:13,889
- No problem.
- Use a different route.

44
00:06:13,972 --> 00:06:17,088
- I don't want us to look like a caravan.
- Right. OK.

45
00:06:19,012 --> 00:06:23,368
- Let's just split.
- Are you crazy? We have 20 large coming.

46
00:06:23,451 --> 00:06:26,965
- I don't like it. This guy's psycho.
- You're forgetting something.

47
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:29,609
Last month? Phoenix? You owe me.

48
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:32,487
So let's get the money, then split. All right?

49
00:06:47,687 --> 00:06:50,120
Mm-hm. This is fine, Patty.

50
00:06:50,207 --> 00:06:55,519
We'll finish it after the breakfast. Still got
a couple of hours to grab some sleep.

51
00:06:55,606 --> 00:06:57,914
Only if you do.

52
00:06:58,005 --> 00:06:59,996
I made mochas.

53
00:07:00,085 --> 00:07:02,076
Hey. I thought you were down.

54
00:07:03,044 --> 00:07:05,036
I'm up. I couldn't sleep.

55
00:07:05,924 --> 00:07:10,520
The polls open in less than three hours...
Mr. President-To-Be.

56
00:07:11,003 --> 00:07:15,201
- Heavy on the caffeine for me. Patty?
- Nothin' for me. Thanks.

57
00:07:15,283 --> 00:07:17,273
- Mom?
- No.

58
00:07:18,682 --> 00:07:21,594
You look exhausted.
Go to bed. That's an order.

59
00:07:23,042 --> 00:07:26,158
All right. Promise you'll wake me
if you need anything?

60
00:07:26,241 --> 00:07:28,311
- Absolutely.
- OK.

61
00:07:32,521 --> 00:07:34,875
- Night.
- Good night.

62
00:07:39,719 --> 00:07:41,710
David.

63
00:07:42,999 --> 00:07:45,752
You won't say anything
to Nicole about Keith, will you?

64
00:07:45,838 --> 00:07:50,275
We don't even know whether Maureen
Kingsley's going to go forward with the story.

65
00:07:50,357 --> 00:07:52,030
- I have to, Sherry.
- Why?

66
00:07:52,118 --> 00:07:56,746
Because the press is gonna get a hold of this,
whether it's today, tomorrow or next week.

67
00:07:56,836 --> 00:08:00,715
- Nicole should be prepared.
- I thought you said Carl would take care of it.

68
00:08:00,796 --> 00:08:04,835
He'll do what he can, but I don't want her
to suddenly hear something on the news.

69
00:08:04,915 --> 00:08:07,554
- She'd be devastated.
- She's so happy right now, David.

70
00:08:07,636 --> 00:08:10,195
We've gotta take it one step at a time.

71
00:08:10,274 --> 00:08:12,265
Dad, it's ready.

72
00:08:24,232 --> 00:08:29,146
Dad, I've figured it all out. Even if we lose
Orange County, we're still gonna win.

73
00:08:29,232 --> 00:08:31,427
If we win Ventura by a ten per cent margin.

74
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:35,390
No. Even seven.
It's all right there in last night's poll.

75
00:08:36,191 --> 00:08:39,103
You make it look like
there's nothing to worry about.

76
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:42,227
That's because there is
nothing to worry about.

77
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:46,828
- Mm. Dad...
- Nicole...

78
00:08:46,909 --> 00:08:48,945
- No, go ahead.
- No, no, no. You first.

79
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:54,148
I talked to Suzy and Rachel Brenner. They're
flying out. I invited them to the victory party.

80
00:08:54,228 --> 00:08:57,618
My Lord. I haven't seen them
since you all were in high school.

81
00:08:57,707 --> 00:09:00,619
Well, we're gonna see them tomorrow.
Actually, tonight.

82
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:03,779
Ah, that's great. What were you gonna say?

83
00:09:04,706 --> 00:09:06,697
Nothin'.

84
00:09:07,266 --> 00:09:10,655
- CTU, this is Myers.
- Mason looking over your shoulder?

85
00:09:10,745 --> 00:09:14,579
No. He ended the lockdown
as soon as he found out where you were.

86
00:09:14,665 --> 00:09:16,575
Be careful. He'll come after you.

87
00:09:16,665 --> 00:09:20,418
I'm at the precinct. They've got a ring
around the suspect. I need help.

88
00:09:20,504 --> 00:09:24,383
Get Ryan Sealey over at District.
Say it's about Palmer and I need an override.

89
00:09:24,463 --> 00:09:26,454
OK. I'll take care of it.

90
00:09:34,262 --> 00:09:35,661
Damn it.

91
00:09:43,861 --> 00:09:49,014
Tony, I'm still off the net. I need a contact
number for Ryan Sealey at District Two.

92
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,651
Sure.

93
00:09:54,059 --> 00:09:56,209
You still pissed off about the lockdown?

94
00:09:56,299 --> 00:09:59,813
Jack's never gonna trust you again,
and I'm not sure I will either.

95
00:09:59,898 --> 00:10:02,571
You don't trust me, but you trust Jack?

96
00:10:02,658 --> 00:10:05,296
Come on, Nina. He's been lying.

97
00:10:05,377 --> 00:10:09,734
He's been hiding things from us.
It may be OK for you, but it's not OK for me.

98
00:10:10,737 --> 00:10:13,170
Do you have the number?

99
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:22,486
Thank you.

100
00:10:28,134 --> 00:10:32,092
Sorry, but this guy killed a cop.
I won't interfere with booking protocol.

101
00:10:32,174 --> 00:10:36,007
I told you - you'll get a call from Ryan Sealey,
our liaison to the PD's office.

102
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:39,483
Until then, you can have my badge,
my gun, and I will not interfere.

103
00:10:39,573 --> 00:10:42,530
- But I need to see that man now.
- What can I tell you?

104
00:10:42,611 --> 00:10:46,320
- Fine. Where's your lieutenant?
- He checked out. Midnight.

105
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:49,164
But if he was here,
he'd tell you the same thing.

106
00:10:49,251 --> 00:10:54,847
Sergeant, the cop that was killed tonight,
Officer Hampton. Did you know her?

107
00:10:57,770 --> 00:11:00,203
- I knew her.
- I'm investigating a federal case.

108
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:03,964
She was helping me.
Do you want her death to be in vain?

109
00:11:05,128 --> 00:11:09,007
Please forget about the damn chain
of command. I need to see this man now.

110
00:11:09,088 --> 00:11:10,965
Just for a few minutes. Please.

111
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:27,480
Where's the suspect?

112
00:11:27,565 --> 00:11:29,556
Move him to room two.

113
00:11:33,924 --> 00:11:35,915
- Thank you.
- Follow me.

114
00:11:44,163 --> 00:11:47,359
Hold it, Sergeant.
This man's under my authority.

115
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:17,270
We shouldn't have let him take her! There's
two of us, one of him, and we got a gun.

116
00:12:17,358 --> 00:12:21,669
- You don't wanna pull a piece on Mr. Gaines.
- No? Just on girls?

117
00:12:21,757 --> 00:12:25,874
If you had the hots for her,
then you should have done something.

118
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:29,112
I just don't want her to get hurt.

119
00:12:29,196 --> 00:12:32,791
Get real, dude.
She saw our faces. She saw his face.

120
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:35,309
She's not walking. She never was.

121
00:12:36,555 --> 00:12:40,024
- You think he's gonna kill her?
- Maybe he already has.

122
00:12:41,754 --> 00:12:45,462
Rick. Dude. Come on. It's ten grand apiece.

123
00:12:45,553 --> 00:12:49,990
All right? We just wanna get paid
and get going. Forget Kimberly, man.

124
00:12:50,073 --> 00:12:52,108
She's history.

125
00:13:02,471 --> 00:13:06,702
Listen, till you can tell me what you were
doing at Dunlop Plaza with Richard Walsh,

126
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:10,748
- I'm treating you as a prime suspect.
- Why would I kill my only ally at the agency?

127
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:15,061
You tell me. Why'd you blow the whistle on
your own agents, and try to blackmail me?

128
00:13:15,149 --> 00:13:18,026
Because you were
withholding vital information.

129
00:13:18,109 --> 00:13:23,023
I was following orders. I realise that's
a concept you may be unfamiliar with, Jack,

130
00:13:23,108 --> 00:13:26,986
but it's something that some of us
actually do take seriously.

131
00:13:28,187 --> 00:13:33,420
Through there is a suspect who is connected
with the people who want Palmer dead.

132
00:13:33,506 --> 00:13:34,416
How do you know?

133
00:13:34,506 --> 00:13:37,815
Walsh and Baylor died because
they got information that led me to him.

134
00:13:37,905 --> 00:13:40,942
And if you interfere now
and something happens to Palmer,

135
00:13:41,026 --> 00:13:46,622
you'll be seen as impeding this investigation
cos of a grudge against me, so cut the crap.

136
00:13:47,824 --> 00:13:50,702
How do you wanna play this?

137
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:58,494
I'll talk to him myself.

138
00:13:58,582 --> 00:14:03,292
Look, you're lucky I haven't already
put you in cuffs. Just sit down.

139
00:14:11,421 --> 00:14:13,138
- Gaines.
- Have you heard from him?

140
00:14:13,221 --> 00:14:17,691
No. I'm gonna be calling him in about
15 minutes. He should be done by then.

141
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:23,328
I've got the girl and we're on our way
to the compound right now.

142
00:14:23,418 --> 00:14:25,409
Gotta go.

143
00:14:26,178 --> 00:14:28,169
Stop, please.

144
00:14:55,654 --> 00:14:58,964
Listen, I don't have time
for this, you understand?

145
00:15:19,611 --> 00:15:21,840
- Maureen, it's David Palmer.
- Senator?

146
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:25,080
- I'm sorry to wake you.
- Oh, no, no, that's OK. What's up?

147
00:15:25,169 --> 00:15:28,400
- The matter you called about earlier.
- Mm-hm.

148
00:15:28,489 --> 00:15:31,844
- We need to talk about it.
- OK. Um... let's talk.

149
00:15:31,929 --> 00:15:36,285
Since we're just a few floors apart,
I was thinking maybe we could get together.

150
00:15:36,367 --> 00:15:40,519
- OK. How about I meet you in the lobby?
- No, no. The lobby's too public.

151
00:15:40,608 --> 00:15:43,724
The conference room on the third floor -
I'll have it opened.

152
00:15:43,807 --> 00:15:47,355
Just need about ten minutes to get dressed.
How does that sound?

153
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:50,165
- Yeah, that's good.
- I'll see you in ten.

154
00:15:50,246 --> 00:15:52,236
- Thanks, Maureen.
- Sure.

155
00:15:57,565 --> 00:15:59,953
And those are the only places
you know they were?

156
00:16:00,045 --> 00:16:01,477
Yes.

157
00:16:01,564 --> 00:16:05,397
What about this boy, uh, Dan,
who works at the furniture store?

158
00:16:05,483 --> 00:16:08,919
We don't know anything about him,
but the store owner's a . Nowrasteh.

159
00:16:09,003 --> 00:16:11,392
I have his number in here somewhere.

160
00:16:12,523 --> 00:16:14,752
Here you are.

161
00:16:14,842 --> 00:16:16,833
Excuse me.

162
00:16:20,281 --> 00:16:23,512
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me. Is Janet out of surgery yet?

163
00:16:23,601 --> 00:16:26,160
Yeah. The police showed up.
We're talking to them now.

164
00:16:26,241 --> 00:16:28,754
- Anything new?
- No. How about you?

165
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:33,196
I'm at the Van Nuys police station. Someone
here knows where the girls were tonight.

166
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:37,477
- You mean one of the police officers?
- No. They picked him up in North Hollywood.

167
00:16:37,558 --> 00:16:39,515
- I think he saw Kim.
- Who?

168
00:16:39,598 --> 00:16:42,112
- I don't know. A man.
- Well, what did he say?

169
00:16:42,198 --> 00:16:46,827
I'm waiting to talk to him. You've gotta talk to
Janet as soon as she gets out of surgery, OK?

170
00:16:46,917 --> 00:16:48,748
I know. I know, I know.

171
00:16:49,357 --> 00:16:52,110
I'll call you as soon as I can. I gotta go. Bye.

172
00:16:57,835 --> 00:17:00,144
So what did he say?

173
00:17:00,235 --> 00:17:03,431
He says he won't talk to anybody except you.

174
00:17:06,555 --> 00:17:08,590
So, can I go in?

175
00:17:09,474 --> 00:17:11,828
Yeah.

176
00:17:11,914 --> 00:17:13,904
Thank you.

177
00:17:27,511 --> 00:17:30,503
My colleague said
you only wanted to speak to me.

178
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:34,259
Well, here I am. And guess what?

179
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:38,422
- Right now, you're speaking to everyone.
- What the hell is he doing?

180
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:42,464
- I thought we were going to talk alone.
- You killed a cop.

181
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:46,504
What you need to do right now
is start telling me the truth.

182
00:17:46,588 --> 00:17:49,898
It was self-defence. You were chasing me.

183
00:17:50,308 --> 00:17:52,299
What's he saying?

184
00:17:54,188 --> 00:17:57,384
Go to hell! I'm done talking.
Get this guy outta my face!

185
00:18:05,266 --> 00:18:08,177
- You've got nothing. I want my lawyer!
- Settle down.

186
00:18:08,265 --> 00:18:10,256
- I'll take him.
- Come on.

187
00:18:10,345 --> 00:18:13,256
I want my phone call. You've got nothing!

188
00:18:13,665 --> 00:18:17,020
- I want my phone call, now!
- Jack. Great job.

189
00:18:18,024 --> 00:18:20,902
- He knows something.
- So are you gonna beat it out of him?

190
00:18:20,983 --> 00:18:24,895
What's the plan, Jack? Hm? What's the plan?

191
00:18:24,983 --> 00:18:26,973
Take a walk.

192
00:19:06,336 --> 00:19:08,611
- Bauer.
- Is this line safe?

193
00:19:08,696 --> 00:19:11,414
- Tell me about my daughter.
- Not till you get me out.

194
00:19:11,496 --> 00:19:15,283
- How do you know where she is?
- I heard some guys talking. Guys I work with.

195
00:19:15,376 --> 00:19:18,208
- What guys?
- All you need to know is they have her.

196
00:19:18,294 --> 00:19:21,047
- They're gonna call me in 20 minutes.
- Where?

197
00:19:21,135 --> 00:19:23,602
- Back where you first saw me.
- San Fernando Road?

198
00:19:23,694 --> 00:19:27,528
Yeah. But if I don't answer, they'll know
something's wrong, so get me out.

199
00:19:27,613 --> 00:19:31,208
- I don't know if I can.
- I'm the one chance you got to find her.

200
00:19:31,292 --> 00:19:34,125
I'm not there for that call, the chance is over.

201
00:19:34,212 --> 00:19:36,203
Better think of something fast.

202
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:52,809
- CTU. This is Myers.
- Hey. It's Jack.

203
00:19:52,889 --> 00:19:56,927
The suspect's name is Penticoff.
He's expecting a call in 20 minutes

204
00:19:57,009 --> 00:19:59,648
at 18166 San Fernando Road.

205
00:19:59,728 --> 00:20:02,640
I need you to trace all available public lines.

206
00:20:05,248 --> 00:20:10,799
- I see water lines, utilities, no phone lines.
- Keep looking. He said he'd get the call there.

207
00:20:10,887 --> 00:20:13,958
Wait. There's a pay phone
halfway down the block.

208
00:20:14,846 --> 00:20:17,076
- And it's in service.
- Set up a trace.

209
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:20,123
- There's not enough time for a warrant.
- Forget the warrant!

210
00:20:20,206 --> 00:20:23,914
If they're expecting Penticoff,
they'll hang up when they hear your voice.

211
00:20:24,005 --> 00:20:27,280
- They won't. They'll hear Penticoff's.
- Did Mason get him out?

212
00:20:27,365 --> 00:20:30,355
- No.
- So what are you planning? A jailbreak?

213
00:20:31,243 --> 00:20:33,075
Jack?

214
00:20:35,163 --> 00:20:37,154
Set up the trace.

215
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:05,275
Bauer's behaviour is far from
representative of this agency's work.

216
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:10,352
Whether you like it or not, we have to be
involved, because this is bigger than...

217
00:21:13,917 --> 00:21:16,590
Hey. Are you the officer
that interviewed Penticoff?

218
00:21:16,677 --> 00:21:20,556
- No, I just transferred him to a holding cell.
- I still need to see him.

219
00:21:20,636 --> 00:21:23,070
- You Bauer from CTU?
- Yeah, that's right.

220
00:21:23,876 --> 00:21:28,346
Look, the cop that he killed,
she was my partner, you understand?

221
00:21:30,795 --> 00:21:33,593
- I'm sorry.
- I heard you went off on him before.

222
00:21:33,674 --> 00:21:37,223
I want him to go down for it,
which means a clean bust.

223
00:21:37,314 --> 00:21:40,749
- No more extracurricular activities.
- Understood.

224
00:21:41,913 --> 00:21:44,666
All right. But I've got the access card.

225
00:21:45,953 --> 00:21:49,467
Now, you can go in with me...
or you don't go in.

226
00:21:50,152 --> 00:21:52,426
I'm fine with that.

227
00:22:08,269 --> 00:22:10,863
- Keep him away from me.
- Just a few more questions.

228
00:22:10,949 --> 00:22:13,940
No more questions without my lawyer.

229
00:22:14,028 --> 00:22:17,576
- Who are you working for?
- Are you deaf?

230
00:22:17,668 --> 00:22:20,580
I said no questions without my lawyer.

231
00:22:21,627 --> 00:22:23,697
- Your lawyer can kiss my ass.
- Oh, yeah?

232
00:22:23,787 --> 00:22:25,981
- Who do you work for?
- Hey, hey! Back off!

233
00:22:26,066 --> 00:22:28,580
- Get your hands off of me.
- He killed my partner!

234
00:22:28,666 --> 00:22:32,135
- I know. I was there. Where were you?
- What?

235
00:22:32,586 --> 00:22:35,543
Where were you
when your partner really needed you?

236
00:22:41,264 --> 00:22:42,777
Hey!

237
00:22:42,864 --> 00:22:44,980
Get him outta here!

238
00:22:46,384 --> 00:22:50,773
- What the hell's the matter with you?
- He's crazy. I'm filing charges.

239
00:22:55,462 --> 00:22:58,374
You oughta get yourself under control, Bauer.

240
00:22:59,781 --> 00:23:02,500
What's going on? I'll take care of it.

241
00:23:26,338 --> 00:23:31,331
Paediatric resident to Labour and Delivery.
Paediatric resident to Labour and Delivery.

242
00:23:37,256 --> 00:23:39,928
I'm sorry. I... I didn't mean to wake you.

243
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:43,407
- I wasn't asleep.
- I thought you might like some coffee.

244
00:23:43,494 --> 00:23:45,486
Thank you.

245
00:23:56,173 --> 00:23:59,722
- She'll turn up.
- How's Janet?

246
00:24:01,132 --> 00:24:02,485
Um...

247
00:24:03,532 --> 00:24:06,683
They're relieving some pressure on her spine.

248
00:24:07,332 --> 00:24:10,720
But she's gonna be OK.
At least, that's what they say.

249
00:24:10,811 --> 00:24:13,005
Of course she will.

250
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:17,761
Any news from Jack?

251
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:20,966
No. As far as I know,
he's still out looking for Kim.

252
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:25,565
Well, that's good. You said he has
resources the police don't have, right?

253
00:24:32,808 --> 00:24:34,798
Even so, um...

254
00:24:36,127 --> 00:24:38,321
I imagine you wish he were here.

255
00:24:47,965 --> 00:24:49,956
Hands out, please.

256
00:24:55,844 --> 00:24:59,632
- Turn around.
- Oh, enough. Maureen's an old friend.

257
00:24:59,724 --> 00:25:03,033
- It's all right. He's just doing his job.
- Thank you.

258
00:25:03,123 --> 00:25:05,636
Your ID, ma'am.

259
00:25:05,723 --> 00:25:07,713
Would you excuse us?

260
00:25:11,681 --> 00:25:14,196
How long have we known
each other, Maureen?

261
00:25:14,281 --> 00:25:16,875
Come on, Senator. That's not fair.

262
00:25:16,961 --> 00:25:18,997
No, I'm just saying.

263
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,674
You, me, my family.

264
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,751
We made a journey together,

265
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,718
from local politics to where we are now.

266
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:30,678
We helped each other along,
because we cared about the same things.

267
00:25:30,759 --> 00:25:33,831
- I know that.
- Have I ever lied to you?

268
00:25:33,918 --> 00:25:36,591
- No.
- Embarrassed you?

269
00:25:36,678 --> 00:25:39,715
- No.
- Then why are you doing this?

270
00:25:40,158 --> 00:25:44,035
Senator, I wish to God
that I didn't get this information.

271
00:25:44,717 --> 00:25:48,026
- But we're talking about murder.
- A rumour.

272
00:25:48,837 --> 00:25:53,704
Started by my enemies, of whom,
as you well know, I have many.

273
00:25:53,795 --> 00:25:58,107
That's what I thought too, at first. But...

274
00:25:58,714 --> 00:26:00,625
Please. Go on.

275
00:26:01,554 --> 00:26:05,467
- You know I can't tell you my sources.
- Come on, Maureen.

276
00:26:05,554 --> 00:26:08,545
We're not in court here. I'm just an old friend,

277
00:26:08,633 --> 00:26:11,830
with a career and family
that you just may destroy.

278
00:26:12,872 --> 00:26:15,022
You owe me that much, at least.

279
00:26:17,032 --> 00:26:19,023
OK.

280
00:26:20,671 --> 00:26:22,549
Two sources.

281
00:26:23,871 --> 00:26:26,624
One, a man named George Ferragamo.

282
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:30,908
He was your son's therapist for four years.

283
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:33,540
He came to me with the story.

284
00:26:35,229 --> 00:26:37,299
And the second source?

285
00:26:39,269 --> 00:26:44,422
The boy who raped your daughter, then
threw himself off the balcony - Lyle Gibson?

286
00:26:44,508 --> 00:26:49,661
His autopsy showed that he had cuts and
scratches that pointed to "a violent struggle".

287
00:26:50,907 --> 00:26:53,216
Nicole tried to fight him off.

288
00:26:54,146 --> 00:26:56,535
Yes, that was the explanation.

289
00:26:56,626 --> 00:27:00,335
But an hour later, an African-American
teenage boy went to an emergency room,

290
00:27:00,426 --> 00:27:03,019
one block away, with similar injuries.

291
00:27:04,025 --> 00:27:06,174
The name here says Edward Johnson.

292
00:27:06,265 --> 00:27:10,542
The handwriting where
he filled out the form and signed his name?

293
00:27:12,503 --> 00:27:14,494
I had it analysed by an expert.

294
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:18,857
It's your son's.

295
00:27:31,781 --> 00:27:35,932
I don't give a damn about your expert.
My son never killed anybody.

296
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:39,978
- Senator, I would never...
- You do what you have to do, Maureen.

297
00:27:40,899 --> 00:27:43,891
Just be prepared to accept the consequences.

298
00:28:07,495 --> 00:28:12,363
.. truth in the rumour that the Pentagon
wastefully dumped military supplies

299
00:28:12,454 --> 00:28:15,571
costing millions, perhaps billions,
of taxpayer dollars

300
00:28:15,654 --> 00:28:18,327
in the years since the Vietnam War started.

301
00:28:18,414 --> 00:28:21,053
The spokesman, who declined
to be interviewed on camera,

302
00:28:21,133 --> 00:28:24,045
states only that "in the hurly-burly of war

303
00:28:24,133 --> 00:28:27,010
and the constant movement
of perimeters and people,

304
00:28:27,093 --> 00:28:29,765
one must expect that
there would be a certain amount

305
00:28:29,852 --> 00:28:32,810
of acceptable loss
of supplies and armaments. "

306
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:46,838
Hey, Dad.

307
00:28:49,049 --> 00:28:51,039
Somethin' wrong?

308
00:28:51,689 --> 00:28:53,679
I guess you'll have to tell me.

309
00:29:03,127 --> 00:29:08,280
The night your sister was raped, did you have
any contact with the boy who raped her?

310
00:29:09,406 --> 00:29:11,873
- What?
- You heard me.

311
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:16,315
I... I don't believe this. I mean...

312
00:29:17,045 --> 00:29:19,319
What brought this up all of a sudden?

313
00:29:19,405 --> 00:29:22,953
I mean, let's just leave that
all in the past where it belongs.

314
00:29:23,044 --> 00:29:25,035
I'd like to, believe me.

315
00:29:27,164 --> 00:29:29,358
But, as it happens, I can't.

316
00:29:34,362 --> 00:29:39,197
What did you do that night, after you
found out that Nicole had been attacked?

317
00:29:39,281 --> 00:29:41,591
The truth, now. All of it.

318
00:29:43,641 --> 00:29:46,632
I don't think you have a right to ask me that.

319
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:55,072
- You don't think I have the right?
- No, I don't.

320
00:29:55,759 --> 00:30:00,275
See, this thing happened.
Somebody had to deal with it.

321
00:30:00,358 --> 00:30:03,156
But you were in Chicago
givin' a speech, or New York...

322
00:30:03,238 --> 00:30:05,876
We'll deal with
my shortcomings as a father later.

323
00:30:05,958 --> 00:30:09,632
Now I wanna know what you did after
you found out your sister had been raped.

324
00:30:09,717 --> 00:30:13,596
- And I told you. I'm not gonna answer.
- You will answer me!

325
00:30:37,553 --> 00:30:39,908
I apologise about Bauer.

326
00:30:39,992 --> 00:30:43,871
But I'd really appreciate it
if we could handle this internally.

327
00:30:43,952 --> 00:30:46,306
I got no problem with that.

328
00:30:46,392 --> 00:30:50,304
Sergeant, excuse me, but if our federal
colleagues are through with Penticoff,

329
00:30:50,391 --> 00:30:54,178
- I'd like to process him into the system.
- Why are you here? I thought you left.

330
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:58,342
I'm not leaving till Penticoff
is behind bars without bail.

331
00:30:58,430 --> 00:31:00,785
The computer says you left five minutes ago.

332
00:31:00,869 --> 00:31:03,019
All right, guys, we're on the move.

333
00:31:03,749 --> 00:31:05,739
Damn it!

334
00:31:08,868 --> 00:31:11,701
I got this notice in the mail this afternoon.

335
00:31:11,788 --> 00:31:15,019
Actually, it was yesterday afternoon.

336
00:31:15,107 --> 00:31:17,098
Kimberly was failing algebra.

337
00:31:18,387 --> 00:31:23,096
It was the second notice. She intercepted
the first one and threw it away.

338
00:31:24,985 --> 00:31:27,374
When she got home, I was so mad at her.

339
00:31:33,384 --> 00:31:39,573
I guess I accused her, and I...
I said things to her I shouldn't have said.

340
00:31:39,663 --> 00:31:43,099
There isn't a parent in the world
who hasn't been there.

341
00:31:44,023 --> 00:31:49,050
Last night, when I told her good night,
she wouldn't even acknowledge me.

342
00:31:50,982 --> 00:31:53,655
I actually had the thought that I'd be...

343
00:31:53,742 --> 00:31:56,414
I'd be so glad when she got out of the house.

344
00:32:01,701 --> 00:32:05,375
When Janet wakes up, she'll know
where Kim is and then we'll find her.

345
00:32:05,459 --> 00:32:07,530
- I just hope it'll be that easy.
- It will.

346
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:10,497
But why wasn't she with Janet?
It doesn't make any sense.

347
00:32:10,579 --> 00:32:14,093
- Maybe she got freaked out by the accident.
- We should've waited.

348
00:32:14,179 --> 00:32:16,329
- We should've waited.
- No, no, no.

349
00:32:16,418 --> 00:32:21,445
We were right to come here.
All we had to go on was the ambulance.

350
00:32:21,537 --> 00:32:23,846
We had to follow up on it.

351
00:32:29,256 --> 00:32:31,247
Listen, whatever happens,

352
00:32:32,615 --> 00:32:35,414
I'm gonna stay with you until we find Kim.

353
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:39,446
You have my promise.

354
00:32:41,335 --> 00:32:43,325
Thank you.

355
00:32:45,054 --> 00:32:47,284
Come on, Davis, we need that uplink.

356
00:32:49,014 --> 00:32:51,402
He says we oughta have a picture by now.

357
00:32:53,332 --> 00:32:57,564
W-7 satellite was in the southwest sector
when Bauer helped Penticoff escape,

358
00:32:57,652 --> 00:33:02,441
so, with luck, we'll be able to pull up some
visuals that'll help us pinpoint his location.

359
00:33:02,531 --> 00:33:04,806
- That's it.
- Here we go. All right.

360
00:33:04,891 --> 00:33:08,644
Davis, the link's up.
Now I gotta get a back trace.

361
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:11,603
This is the roof of the building
from 200 miles up.

362
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:14,123
About how long
would you say since they got out?

363
00:33:14,209 --> 00:33:16,962
I don't know. Seven or eight minutes?

364
00:33:17,049 --> 00:33:21,564
OK. Davis? I wanna go back ten minutes,
and give me stills at 30-second intervals.

365
00:33:21,649 --> 00:33:25,481
Look for two men
exiting the building together.

366
00:33:25,568 --> 00:33:28,036
As often minutes ago...

367
00:33:28,128 --> 00:33:30,687
- 30...
- There they are.

368
00:33:31,687 --> 00:33:34,723
- OK, you can speed it up.
- All right. Speeding up.

369
00:33:36,246 --> 00:33:38,202
- Slow it down now.
- You got it.

370
00:33:38,285 --> 00:33:40,276
You got a mark on that car?

371
00:33:43,045 --> 00:33:45,764
- Coming to you now.
- All right.

372
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:48,276
Where are you headed, Jack?

373
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,319
- All set?
- All set.

374
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,675
- How much time do you need?
- A few seconds.

375
00:34:23,279 --> 00:34:25,554
- Who are these guys?
- I told you. I don't know.

376
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:29,234
They tell me what to do.
I do it, they pay me. That's it.

377
00:34:29,318 --> 00:34:32,116
It's ringing.

378
00:34:32,197 --> 00:34:33,870
- Yeah?
- I'm not showing anything.

379
00:34:33,957 --> 00:34:35,072
Yeah?

380
00:34:35,158 --> 00:34:39,786
- It's a cellphone.
- We're screwed. I don't know the frequency.

381
00:34:40,197 --> 00:34:41,788
- I'll get back to you.
- Jack?

382
00:34:41,877 --> 00:34:44,595
- Yeah?
- It's Gaines. There's a change of plan.

383
00:34:44,676 --> 00:34:49,908
Nothing you can't handle. Taped to the back
of the phone is a set of keys with a remote.

384
00:34:52,315 --> 00:34:55,067
- Got 'em.
- It's for a parked car on Avenue 26.

385
00:34:55,154 --> 00:34:59,305
Nevada plates, 782NOF.
Find it with the remote.

386
00:34:59,394 --> 00:35:01,953
There's a body in the trunk. Get rid obit.

387
00:35:02,633 --> 00:35:04,624
- What does he mean, body?
- I don't know.

388
00:35:04,713 --> 00:35:07,307
- Whose body is in the trunk?
- I don't know!

389
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:25,781
Walk in front of me.

390
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:28,623
Come on.

391
00:35:42,427 --> 00:35:46,943
Kneel up against that wall and interlock
your fingers behind your head. Now.

392
00:35:47,427 --> 00:35:49,656
Don't move.

393
00:35:54,185 --> 00:35:56,177
Oh, my God.

394
00:36:15,382 --> 00:36:17,896
- Hey, Jack.
- Hey, we had a deal.

395
00:36:17,982 --> 00:36:20,177
Shut up.

396
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:22,980
- Put him in the car.
- Hey! Hey!

397
00:36:23,061 --> 00:36:24,699
Bauer!

398
00:36:24,781 --> 00:36:28,091
That's pretty quick work, George.
Trackin' me on a satellite?

399
00:36:28,181 --> 00:36:32,651
- I'm takin' you in, Jack.
- He had evidence on the Palmer hit.

400
00:36:32,739 --> 00:36:35,128
That's why I broke him out.

401
00:36:38,898 --> 00:36:41,618
- So who was this?
- I don't know yet.

402
00:36:45,538 --> 00:36:49,166
You're havin' quite a night here,
aren't you, Jack?

403
00:36:49,617 --> 00:36:52,256
Why don't you tell me
what the hell is going on here?

404
00:36:52,336 --> 00:36:56,649
Unless you want me to throw you
back to the cops? They're ready for you.

405
00:36:58,816 --> 00:37:02,888
There are people within the agency
that are supporting the Palmer hit.

406
00:37:02,975 --> 00:37:05,967
That's why Walsh and Baylor were killed.
They found out.

407
00:37:06,054 --> 00:37:08,488
The truth is, I thought you were a part of it.

408
00:37:08,574 --> 00:37:11,088
I apologise if I was wrong.

409
00:37:11,174 --> 00:37:14,883
George, as crazy as this sounds,
you're gonna have to trust me.

410
00:37:14,973 --> 00:37:20,127
This is gonna look very bad for us
if something happens to Palmer tonight.

411
00:37:25,932 --> 00:37:28,890
- So what's next?
- I need to take the body down to CTU,

412
00:37:28,971 --> 00:37:31,121
and try and make an ID.

413
00:37:31,211 --> 00:37:34,248
I'll go grill Penticoff,
get what I can outta him.

414
00:37:36,051 --> 00:37:38,405
- We never had this conversation, right?
- Right.

415
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:43,483
I'll be at District. OK. Call the precinct,
tell 'em we've recovered Penticoff.

416
00:38:00,127 --> 00:38:02,880
- What have we got?
- Body. Male. Badly mutilated.

417
00:38:02,966 --> 00:38:05,878
I need a positive ID now.
Who's our best forensic?

418
00:38:05,966 --> 00:38:08,604
- Perry Tanaka.
- Get him. I'll be there in ten minutes.

419
00:38:08,686 --> 00:38:10,164
- I'm on it.
- OK.

420
00:38:17,404 --> 00:38:19,280
- Yes, Doctor.
- Clamp, please.

421
00:38:21,363 --> 00:38:23,399
Hello?

422
00:38:23,483 --> 00:38:26,395
- Hey. It's me.
- Jack, did you find out anything?

423
00:38:26,483 --> 00:38:29,155
- Maybe. I'm not sure yet.
- What have you been doing?

424
00:38:29,242 --> 00:38:32,200
- I'll be there in 20 minutes. I'll explain then.
- All right.

425
00:38:32,282 --> 00:38:35,830
- Janet out of surgery yet?
- No, not yet. She should be soon.

426
00:38:35,921 --> 00:38:38,640
Good. It's really important I talk to her.

427
00:38:38,721 --> 00:38:42,759
I know it sounds cold, sweetheart,
but she's our only link to Kimberly.

428
00:38:42,841 --> 00:38:46,071
Hang in there, honey.
I love you. I'm on my way, OK?

429
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,151
OK.

430
00:39:12,756 --> 00:39:14,747
Just be cool.

431
00:39:29,233 --> 00:39:32,509
We'd like our money now,
if that's like, you know, OK.

432
00:39:35,233 --> 00:39:40,181
Well, just so we're, like, you know, clear...
what happened to the other girl?

433
00:39:40,272 --> 00:39:43,263
Janet? It's like I told you. We had to kill her.

434
00:39:44,671 --> 00:39:46,946
My people say someone
fitting her description

435
00:39:47,031 --> 00:39:49,942
was taken to a hospital
near to where you were.

436
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:53,225
How do you explain that?

437
00:39:55,469 --> 00:39:57,585
Well, the thing is...

438
00:40:00,228 --> 00:40:02,743
Maybe, uh, she wasn't quite dead.

439
00:40:05,148 --> 00:40:08,777
Well, I'll tell you, Dan,
you're either dead or you're not dead.

440
00:40:08,867 --> 00:40:11,506
There's no such thing as sorta dead.

441
00:40:11,587 --> 00:40:13,338
Here. Let me show you.

442
00:40:13,587 --> 00:40:15,498
No!

443
00:40:22,225 --> 00:40:24,819
You've just been promoted.

444
00:40:26,465 --> 00:40:28,455
