1
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,073
- For God's sake, pull yourself together.
- You didn't have to kill her.

2
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,709
Yes, I did. Because you didn't
have the courage to kill her yourself.

3
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,076
Courage? To poison a girl
who did no harm to you at all?

4
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:31,039
This is my husband Navi.
This is Debbie's mother.

5
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:34,908
- Is she here?
We haven't seen her since yesterday.

6
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,949
Get in the car. Follow her.
Make sure she doesn't go to the police.

7
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,079
You're out of here.
Chloe.

8
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,197
Don't worry. Driscoll doesn't know
you were helping me.

9
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,110
She doesn't?

10
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,919
I'm the one that got you into this.
I'm not gonna sell you out.

11
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,629
Tell me what I need to know.

12
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,598
Richard, your father
was kidnapped by terrorists.

13
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,309
Our analysis shows that you're hiding
something that might help us find him.

14
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:05,349
There are people on the outside
looking for us. You cannot give up.

15
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,273
I have to do something while I still can.

16
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,989
This trial is gonna be a spectacle,
broadcast all over the world.

17
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,958
Designed to humiliate
and degrade this country.

18
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,519
There's a gas pipe.

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,594
- You've checked out the briefcase?
- It's fine.

20
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,433
I was afraid it might be damaged
in the train crash.

21
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,158
The case is very strong.

22
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,595
Get them out! Now!

23
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,595
Hurry! Open the door, now!

24
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,039
I know you.

25
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,718
She recognised me.
She has to be killed.

26
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,754
- Erin, I'm on site.
- Jack, stand down.

27
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,955
What are you talking about?

28
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,476
The president wants to take out
the building with a missile strike.

29
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,597
- With the secretary and his daughter inside?
- <i>Yes. </i>

30
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,674
<i>I'm sorry. You're gonna have to clear the area. </i>
<i> Jack, don't go in there alone. </i>

31
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:58,435
<i> Jack, clear the area!</i>
<i>The building is going to be destroyed. </i>

32
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:12,474
James Heller, you have been
brought before this court of law

33
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,438
to stand trial as a war criminal.

34
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,798
We will prove to the people of the world
that these crimes against humanity

35
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:24,317
are the direct result of the policies
initiated by you in your capacity.

36
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,749
Since the true extent of your evil legacy
is immeasurable,

37
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:40,676
we have done our best to document the acts
witnessed directly by the chosen followers.

38
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:44,150
Under your orders,
the death squads of America

39
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:48,199
continue their imperialist crusade
against the true believers.

40
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,714
How long till we're ready
to launch the missile?

41
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,758
Command and control
is locking on target now.

42
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,513
<i> Mr President?</i>
<i>Erin Driscoll on line three. </i>

43
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:08,354
Mr President, I'm calling to ask you
to abort the missile strike.

44
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:12,069
- Based on what?
- We are attempting a rescue operation.

45
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,709
I was told the marine strike force
was ten to 20 minutes away.

46
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,395
They are, sir. Jack Bauer went in by himself.

47
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,434
A terrorist group is moments from executing
the secretary of defense in front of the world.

48
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,512
- I cannot allow that to happen.
- I understand, sir.

49
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,194
But if Jack can effect a rescue before that?

50
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:40,398
In that case, I'll abort the missile strike,
but he's running out of time.

51
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,869
How long does he have, sir?

52
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,358
Seven minutes.

53
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,235
Try and make a sound
and I'll blow your head off.

54
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:01,515
This is a map of the complex. Where are
they holding the secretary of defense?

55
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:06,628
I'm either gonna kill you now or you're gonna
tell me where they're staging the trial.

56
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,234
Point. Now. Where's the secretary?

57
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,110
<i>There is no place in this world</i>

58
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:29,512
<i>where your evil has not scoured</i>
<i>the sacred land of the true word. </i>

59
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:34,830
<i>Your imperialist legacy</i>
<i>has devoured the lives of the innocent. </i>

60
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,797
- <i> Jack?</i>
- Yeah?

61
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,270
- <i>Keeler won't call off the missile strike. </i>
- How much time do I have?

62
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,476
Less than six minutes.

63
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,393
Did you get a thermal read
on how many hostiles?

64
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,472
We estimate 16. Jack...

65
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,154
I'm not turning back, Erin.

66
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,398
Understood.

67
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,675
Good luck.

68
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,115
<i>... the injustices he has committed. </i>

69
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,678
<i>Obedience is a master</i>
<i>who engages the world... </i>

70
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:18,194
Stop this. Please.

71
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:21,590
Just stop this, please.
You've got to stop this.

72
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,911
My father hasn't done anything to hurt you.

73
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,594
He's an innocent man. Please.

74
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:32,918
- <i>Your ignorant followers obey... </i>
- He's innocent.

75
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,276
- Please.
- <i>... while the true believers wait patiently. </i>

76
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,828
Please, listen to me.

77
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:44,708
Please. No, no, wait. Please.
You've got to stop it. Listen!

78
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,035
Audrey? Behind you.

79
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,275
Oh, my God. Jack.

80
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:58,476
- Are you all right? Did they hurt you?
- I'm OK. You've got to stop them.

81
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,915
- I will.
- Get my father first.

82
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,950
Go.

83
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,158
Take this.

84
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,794
Press the button on the handle.

85
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,630
You use that if you have to.

86
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,435
I'll be back for you. I promise.

87
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,879
Jack.

88
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,919
Finally, we hold you responsible
for blasphemy.

89
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,037
For desecrating holy lands and shrines.

90
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,476
<i>And for spilling the blood of our brothers. </i>

91
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:00,839
<i> James Heller, your guilt on these charges</i>
<i>is not a matter of dispute. </i>

92
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:07,075
<i>I have here a full confession</i>
<i>which you have signed. </i>

93
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,709
So now it is time for your sentence to be read

94
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,509
and for the execution of that sentence
to be carried out.

95
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:20,637
James Heller, before the eyes of God,
I sentence you to death.

96
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,838
Carried out immediately.

97
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,953
- Call off the missile.
- Abort. Please confirm.

98
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,871
He's doing it.

99
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:08,188
- There's one in the pipe. We gotta get Audrey.
- Down the hall.

100
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,635
- It's been aborted.
- Where are the marines?

101
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,359
They haven't crossed the perimeter.
I'll get an ETA.

102
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,516
We're clear.

103
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:47,310
She was here. We gotta go. Move, move!

104
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:11,156
Take the two shooters at your 11 o'clock.
You ready?

105
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,708
- Ready!
- Go!

106
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,795
Gimme a clip.

107
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,916
Jack!

108
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,958
It went off my vest.
It's all right. Keep firing.

109
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,317
I'm out!

110
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,315
I'm out too.

111
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,476
It's the marines. Stay down.

112
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,515
Mr Secretary, stay down.
Just stay down until this area's secure.

113
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,435
Jack!

114
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:13,318
- Stand down!
- Step back or I'll kill her.

115
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,756
- Put your gun down now.
- Step back! I'll kill her!

116
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,798
I will kill her!

117
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,269
Do it! Do it!

118
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:25,796
OK. Just relax. Audrey, stay calm.

119
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,157
Just relax.

120
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,233
This is over. You are surrounded.

121
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,791
You're right. But first you'll watch her die.

122
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,474
Yes, sir.

123
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,633
- The president sends his gratitude.
- I'm just glad you both are all right.

124
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,474
It's a while since you been in the field.
You haven't skipped a beat.

125
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,950
- Audrey and I owe you our lives.
- Thank you, sir.

126
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:52,875
I've arranged transportation back to CTU.
I'd like you and Audrey to be debriefed there.

127
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:57,875
As long as we don't lose time finding out who
these terrorists are and where they're from.

128
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:02,795
I'll set up a live feed with the office
in Washington. You won't miss a step.

129
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,634
- Those soldiers are waiting to take us to CTU.
- Thanks.

130
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,869
How is she?

131
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:13,919
A doctor needs to check out
these contusions and she's dehydrated.

132
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,197
- Thank you. We should go.
- Where?

133
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:20,431
I'm taking you and your father back to CTU.

134
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,159
When I was inside,
I recognised one of the men.

135
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,310
- Who?
- I don't know.

136
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,631
I can't place him,
but I know that I saw him before today.

137
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,077
They're gonna correlate a photo file
of the casualties. Then you can make your ID.

138
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,469
Excuse me. Bauer.

139
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:39,030
<i> Agent Bauer, this is CTU.</i>
<i>I've got Paul Raines on the line. </i>

140
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,396
<i>He'd like to speak with his wife. </i>
<i>Is she with you?</i>

141
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,630
Hold on one second.

142
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:49,395
It's Paul. He wants to speak with you.

143
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,036
Paul.

144
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:57,749
- Audrey. Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

145
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,434
- <i>Thank God. </i>
- Where are you?

146
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:04,513
As soon as I heard about you and your father
I got on a plane.

147
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:08,388
- You're in LA?
- <i>Yeah, I'm at CTU.</i>

148
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:11,309
- Audrey?
- <i>Yeah?</i>

149
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,633
See you soon.

150
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,711
I'll see you soon.

151
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,351
We need to go.

152
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,431
You all right?

153
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,515
OK.

154
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,635
- Make sure Edgar gets this.
- Got it.

155
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,679
Find anything?

156
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:52,311
I'm trying to connect to the feed from the site.
Division's using up our bandwidth.

157
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,312
Tell them to multiplex.
We need to go through the debris.

158
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,153
Now Heller's safe,
we're no longer in first position.

159
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,992
Ms Driscoll?

160
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:03,231
- I took care of it.
- What's that?

161
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:06,949
A list of pass codes for the FBI fibre.
You can use their feed.

162
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:11,318
- How did you get that?
- I used to consult there. Still have friends.

163
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:14,836
I saw the load on the routing table
and knew we'd run into a traffic jam.

164
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,639
Good. Install it.

165
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:22,952
Start cataloguing whatever's there.
Anything that flags, promote it up to me.

166
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,712
Yeah.

167
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:34,959
You know, if you let me, Curtis,
I could help you a whole lot more.

168
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,793
I don't even know
why you have a problem with me.

169
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:41,236
Cos I'm ambitious?
OK, I'm ambitious. Aren't you?

170
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:44,153
I don't sleep with people
to get ahead in my career.

171
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,950
Neither do I. I slept with you
because I was attracted to you.

172
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,235
I still am.

173
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,669
Deal with it.

174
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,993
<i>The White House has confirmed</i>
<i>that the interrupted video transmission</i>

175
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:09,471
<i>was caused by a raid mounted by the marines</i>
<i>and the Counter Terrorist Unit</i>

176
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:14,475
<i>who rescued secretary of defense</i>
<i> James Heller moments ago. </i>

177
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,279
- Of course I'm watching.
- <i> Things look good. </i>

178
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,511
God willing our good fortune
will continue for the rest of the day.

179
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,591
What are you talking about?

180
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,911
It's over, they found Omar.
The government stopped the trial.

181
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,754
- Yes, I know.
- Then how can you say this is good fortune?

182
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:33,913
Everything is ruined. You made me
kill someone I cared about over nothing.

183
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,596
No, not for nothing, Behrooz.
The trial was only our first step.

184
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:44,634
- I don't understand.
- There were certain things we kept from you.

185
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,917
- What things?
- Please. I'm busy.

186
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,436
You forced me to kill my girlfriend.
You owe me an explanation.

187
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:54,637
I don't owe you anything.

188
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,835
See who it is. See who it is.

189
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,194
It's Tariq.

190
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,395
Why is he here?

191
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,316
Tariq.

192
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:28,158
- Behrooz, you remember Tariq?
- Of course he does.

193
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,391
I just spoke with Marwan.

194
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,597
- He assured me everything is on schedule.
- Why are you here?

195
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:40,514
Your mother told Marwan
you took care of the American girl?

196
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,876
- Yeah.
- Then you need help getting rid of the body.

197
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,951
I don't need help. I can do it myself.

198
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,998
I'm sure you can,
but we can't afford any more mistakes.

199
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,674
Show Tariq where the body is.

200
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,751
Go.

201
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:19,030
OK, Agent Manning, this is the last
of the bodies. You should see them now.

202
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,078
All right. Got it. What's next?

203
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:27,356
<i>Here's some of the terrorist gear</i>
<i>we collected out of the warehouse. </i>

204
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:35,519
- Wait a second. Stop. Go back.
- You need me to retransmit?

205
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,717
No. In front of you,
gimme a shot of that briefcase.

206
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:42,395
- This?
- Yeah, can you open it?

207
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:50,510
- It's empty.
- Are there any identifying marks on it?

208
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,831
- Some kind of logo engraved near the lock.
- Let me see. Zoom in.

209
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,429
- Make sure that's on the next transport.
- <i>Will do. </i>

210
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,590
Sarah, I need a corporate logo search.

211
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:10,229
I may have a link between the crash
and the abduction. I'll send it now.

212
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,878
We'll pick this up later.

213
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,837
The man I recognised at the warehouse?
I want to make that ID.

214
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,992
As soon as you've been checked out
I'll get the photos.

215
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:22,993
- Excuse me, Ms Raines. This way, please.
- It's all right, go ahead.

216
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:27,073
I need you to handle this.
I need to trust you'll take care of it.

217
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,749
OK. Good. Excuse us.

218
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:40,799
I need your station. Have Driscoll
send me a pass code for the outside feed.

219
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,030
- OK.
- Thanks.

220
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,269
Does he know?

221
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,957
About you and Jack.

222
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:57,510
- How long have you known?
- Not until today.

223
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:01,318
I'm surprised I hadn't figured it out till now.

224
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:05,837
It's not what you think. Paul and I were over
before I started seeing Jack.

225
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:11,313
Paul doesn't think it's over. Last time I spoke
with him, he thought he had a second chance.

226
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:15,837
That's more about fixing his wounded pride
than fixing this relationship.

227
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,388
So, he doesn't know about it?

228
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,471
Not yet.

229
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,319
I'll take care of it.

230
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,718
Ms Raines? Right through here.

231
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:51,714
Yeah. No, not till I get back.

232
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:55,270
You have a thread connecting the bombing
to the abduction?

233
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:59,638
Yeah. About an hour ago.
NTSB reported that a passenger was killed.

234
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:04,589
But not as the result of the crash.
He was shot at close range.

235
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,796
- Who is he?
- Still trying to find out.

236
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,998
He had no ID and his face and prints
don't show up on any database.

237
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:15,039
But whoever killed him stole something
he had chained to his wrists.

238
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,429
I think it may have been this.

239
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:22,035
A witness on the train saw
a man with a briefcase handcuffed to him.

240
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:26,511
Take a look at the damage.
Could've been sustained during the crash.

241
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,319
We recovered this
where Heller was being held.

242
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:35,748
What are you telling me, the train bombing
was a cover for the theft of this briefcase?

243
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,718
- What was in it?
- It was empty.

244
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,598
But we traced the corporate logo
on the briefcase

245
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:45,389
- to McLennen-Forster.
- The defence contractor?

246
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,630
- Yeah.
- Have you contacted them?

247
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,439
Just got off the phone to their CEO.
He stonewalled.

248
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:55,514
Said before he disclosed anything we'd need
clearance from the Department of Defense.

249
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,229
The secretary should be able to get us
whatever clearances we need.

250
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:02,551
- Let's get a printout of all this.
- Yeah.

251
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,832
<i>Our top story, only moments ago</i>
<i>a second broadcast</i>

252
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:10,310
<i>showing secretary of defense James Heller</i>
<i>was put on the Internet. </i>

253
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,552
<i>This image was captured from that broadcast. </i>
<i>The transmission then ceased. </i>

254
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,791
<i>At this time we have</i>
<i>no confirmed report on why... </i>

255
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,235
The girl's mother went home.

256
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,596
Even if she calls the police it will be too late.

257
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,197
I heard the news in the car.
Everything was accomplished?

258
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:34,910
Yes. The trial was cut short,
but it served its purpose.

259
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:41,153
When they search the warehouse,
will they figure out what we're doing?

260
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:45,313
Doesn't matter.
It's too late for them to stop it.

261
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:53,230
If everything is working on schedule,
why do you look so troubled?

262
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,320
Where's Behrooz?

263
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,158
He went to bury the girl.

264
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,391
- But his car is still in the driveway.
- He didn't take it.

265
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,551
I don't understand.

266
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,071
He went with Tariq.

267
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:32,272
Tariq was here?

268
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:36,035
My God, he's going to kill my son.

269
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:44,549
My God.
He's going to kill our son.

270
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,588
Yes.

271
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:49,672
I told Marwan
that Behrooz took care of the girl.

272
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,479
Marwan must not have been satisfied.

273
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:55,916
He must have decided
that Behrooz was a liability.

274
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,310
How could you let this happen?
How could you let them kill our son?

275
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:05,111
- What could I do? What could I do?
- He's our son! Our flesh and blood.

276
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,988
- Dina, listen to me.
- How could you let them kill our son?

277
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,514
Behrooz stopped being our son
a long time ago.

278
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,194
- How can you say that?
- Because it's true.

279
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:18,239
Living here has changed him.
He's been like a stranger to us.

280
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:23,440
He proved it to me today,
that he no longer believes in our cause.

281
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,557
Maybe he never did.

282
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,319
Behrooz. Behrooz. Oh, my God.

283
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:57,714
Secretary Heller would like
to say a few words to you.

284
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:16,033
I'm incredibly privileged to have the finest
people in the world behind me - all of you.

285
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,829
It's gonna take a lot more
than a few words to express my feelings,

286
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:25,311
but for now,
from the bottom of my heart, thank you.

287
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:29,718
- Curtis Manning, head of tactical.
- Curtis.

288
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,950
An honour, sir.

289
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,549
Please, sit down.

290
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:43,110
Erin, my daughter and I owe you our lives.

291
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,716
Sounds like you had to make some
tough calls, but you made the right ones.

292
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:53,670
I'll see to it that you get full recognition
for a job exceptionally well done.

293
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,032
Thank you, sir.

294
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:05,310
Now, before we start the debriefing,
I'd like to visit with my son. Where is he?

295
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:09,552
- We're actually holding Richard here, sir.
- Why's that?

296
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:12,313
When we brought Richard in,
we gave him a polygraph.

297
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,313
It indicated that he was possibly
withholding information from us.

298
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,076
About my kidnapping?

299
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:24,871
We have wildly different political views,
but I can't believe that he was involved.

300
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,599
We don't think he had knowing participation.

301
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:31,036
We believe he shared knowledge
of your whereabouts with someone

302
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:35,113
and he refuses to divulge that information
or their identity.

303
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,316
And what are you doing about that?

304
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:41,518
We discussed a number of options.
You have to understand the circumstances.

305
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,636
Stop BS-ing me. What did you do to him?

306
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:46,996
A technique that's noninvasive -
sensory disorientation.

307
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,913
You subjected my son to SDT?

308
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:53,353
Yes, but it was stopped
the moment you were rescued.

309
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,113
- Jack, did you know about this?
- No, sir.

310
00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:00,079
- I want to see my son now.
- Of course. Curtis.

311
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:04,595
Erin, I realise you've been
under pressure these past few hours,

312
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:07,274
but you'd better have cause for this.

313
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,199
Jack?

314
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:18,916
I appreciate you not involving the secretary
in our differences on this operation.

315
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,991
We both did what we thought was right.

316
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:25,312
I'd like to put the past behind us, Jack.
I could use your help.

317
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,391
What do you need?

318
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:32,759
I'd like you to function in Ronnie's position
as head of field ops until we avert this crisis.

319
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:37,356
- Whatever I can do to help.
- Let me make one thing clear.

320
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:41,914
Ronnie was under my command
and you will be too.

321
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,230
Understood.

322
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,278
The photos from the warehouse,
are they ready for Audrey?

323
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:51,433
I believe so. I'll have Edgar
port them to a work station.

324
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,511
OK. Thank you.

325
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,111
Dad.

326
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:07,317
They said you were OK. Audrey too.
Thank God.

327
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:20,991
I said some aawul things before. I was afraid
I'd never get a chance to apologise.

328
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:24,038
I said some pretty harsh things myself.

329
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:29,069
But no matter what was said, you're still
my son and I will always love you.

330
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,549
Me too, Dad.

331
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:42,199
They said they were using
some interrogation techniques.

332
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:46,239
<i>They were totally out of line. </i>
<i>I'm gonna sue them blind. </i>

333
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:50,677
I think it'll be a little more effective
if you let me deal with it.

334
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:55,754
I promise you,
if they were out of line, heads will roll.

335
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,876
What do you mean, "if"?

336
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:03,438
Why did they think you were
holding something back from them?

337
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,398
I don't know.

338
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,836
If you know something
that would shed some light...

339
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:13,037
You don't think I'd tell them
if I thought it was relevant?

340
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:17,477
- So there is something?
- Now you're giving me the third degree?

341
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:21,872
Son, do you have any idea
what your sister just went through?

342
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:27,432
If you know anything that would help us
find the people behind this, tell me now.

343
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,513
Dad.

344
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,955
I'm glad you're alive, I really am.

345
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:38,194
But I am not going to tell these people things
about my private life they don't need to know.

346
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,999
That you don't <i>think</i> they need to know.

347
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:45,551
Richard, these people
were trying to save our lives.

348
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:49,474
These people can't be trusted!
What they did to me is proof.

349
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:59,590
Agent Manning,
could you come in here, please?

350
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:11,709
Agent Manning, I am authorising you
to do whatever you feel is necessary

351
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:15,952
- to get this information out of my son.
- Dad.

352
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:20,750
I love you, son,
but I have a duty to my country.

353
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,593
You can't be serious.

354
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,117
Dad!

355
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:52,358
Bring the shovels from the back.

356
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,911
Come on. Help me.

357
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:58,554
They said it was OK to come in.

358
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:02,555
Hi, Paul.

359
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,949
My God, I was so worried.

360
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:12,272
- Are you hurt?
- Just cuts and scrapes. Nothing serious.

361
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:16,239
- Sure?
- Yeah, really. I'm OK, Paul.

362
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,515
They've OKed me for my debriefing.

363
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:35,151
On the flight over,
I couldn't stop thinking about us.

364
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,754
How, when we separated, we said

365
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:44,598
that we'd both take time
to figure out what we wanted. Now I know.

366
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:48,311
- Paul...
- I want us to be together again.

367
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,595
I'm ready to work at it.

368
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:54,229
I'll make our marriage the first priority.

369
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,550
Just give us a chance.

370
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,235
I'm sorry, Paul.

371
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,710
That's not what I want.

372
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,319
Audrey.

373
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:16,916
I am a fool for bringing this up. You can't
make decisions when you're in this state.

374
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,116
Paul.

375
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:25,555
I'm seeing someone.

376
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:36,757
Well, how long's this been going on?

377
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,195
Six months.

378
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:44,034
- Do you love him, or...
- Yes.

379
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,677
Audrey?

380
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,554
I'm sorry, excuse me.
I'll come back later.

381
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,517
No, um...

382
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,875
Paul, this is Jack Bauer.

383
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:01,551
- Nice to meet you.
- You're the one that saved Audrey's life.

384
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,870
Thank you.

385
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,356
You're welcome.

386
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,113
- Those photos are ready for you to look at.
- OK.

387
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:16,112
- Paul, we'll talk later?
- Yeah.

388
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:38,075
You all right?

389
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,032
Yeah.

390
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,315
You ready to go?

391
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,391
Not yet.

392
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,800
Now I am.

393
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:38,232
No. No.

394
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,515
You're certain you saw this guy before?

395
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:43,592
Positive, and I could tell
that he recognised me.

396
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,598
No. No.

397
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:52,273
- That's all of them.
- He must've gotten out before the rescue.

398
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,555
We should go through them again
to be sure.

399
00:35:54,640 --> 00:36:00,590
I will, but there are only two men here that
aren't Middle Eastern and neither were him.

400
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:06,397
What?

401
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,119
- I remember where I saw him before.
- Where?

402
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:13,079
There was a Heritage Foundation dinner
about two months ago at the Hyatt.

403
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:17,995
- Do you remember his name?
- No, but maybe I can get the guest list.

404
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:21,436
Driscoll wants you in a conference call
that starts in a minute.

405
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:24,478
OK. Get hold of the Hyatt hotel
security department.

406
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:27,836
Access their archival surveillance.
Audrey'll give you a date.

407
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:31,310
Set a parameter, keep Driscoll informed.
Be right back.

408
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,396
It's hot.

409
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,389
You brought me here to kill me. Why?

410
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:38,078
Why are you doing this?
I did everything they told me to do.

411
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:41,277
- You know why.
- I took care of the girl. Marwan knows.

412
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,999
It's not Marwan who wants you dead.

413
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:46,594
Then who wants me dead?

414
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,671
Who?

415
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,876
Who wants me dead?

416
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,875
I want to know! Tell me!

417
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,394
Your father.

418
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,835
No! No!

419
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:09,469
It's not true! No! No!

420
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:32,556
Dad!

421
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,870
Please!

422
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:37,520
No!

423
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:47,512
Mr Reiss, I'm Erin Driscoll,
director of CTU, Los Angeles.

424
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:50,592
My colleagues Curtis Manning
and Sarah Gavin are present.

425
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:53,194
Also Jack Bauer,
advisor to Secretary Heller.

426
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:57,637
<i>I hope you understand McLennen-Forster</i>
<i>couldn't give you details about that case</i>

427
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,995
<i>until we received permission from DOD.</i>

428
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:04,232
Understood, Mr Reiss. May we begin?
What was your courier transporting?

429
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:08,632
<i>It's a device we developed under the NRC's</i>
<i>emergency management programme. </i>

430
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,109
<i>It's a Dobson-type override. </i>

431
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,350
What exactly does this override do?

432
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:17,877
<i>It can remotely take control</i>
<i>of a nuclear power facility. </i>

433
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:20,952
Under what circumstances
would the override be used?

434
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,793
<i>The government wants</i>
<i>to control a plant's nuclear pile</i>

435
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:26,519
<i>in case of a disaster</i>
<i>necessitating evacuation. </i>

436
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:29,751
A person with this program,
could they do the opposite?

437
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,990
Create a disaster at a plant, a meltdown?

438
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:35,231
<i>Theoretically, but possession</i>
<i>of the override isn't enough. </i>

439
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,709
- <i>There are safeguards. </i>
- What safeguards?

440
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:41,793
<i>Anyone using the override</i>
<i>would have to hack into the reactor's firewall. </i>

441
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:46,715
<i>That would take massive computer power,</i>
<i>which NRC could see coming a mile away. </i>

442
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,109
Is it possible NRC could miss this

443
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:52,112
- due to heavy traffic on the Internet?
- <i>I don't follow. </i>

444
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,714
Less than an hour ago millions of computers

445
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,872
were streaming the trial
of the secretary of defense.

446
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:01,635
Is it possible that this trial
was just some kind of a Trojan Horse

447
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:05,759
to disguise a massive attack
on a nuclear power plant's firewalls?

448
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,956
<i>It might be possible. </i>

449
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:11,350
How many nuclear plants
in this country would be vulnerable?

450
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,432
- <i>All of them. </i>
- How many is that?

451
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:18,635
<i>At this time the United States</i>
<i>has 104 nuclear power plants online. </i>

452
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:23,714
Assume they've used this override to take
over the plants. Get me NRC and find Heller.

453
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,074
Thank you.

454
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:28,630
- Set up a briefing.
Get me NRC. Pipe it through here.

455
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:32,030
I want all personnel
in the conference area.

456
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:36,272
Edgar, can you monitor
my allocation tables for a few minutes?

457
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,237
Sure.

458
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:01,358
- <i> Yes?</i>
- It's me.

459
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,431
- <i>You're on a secure line?</i>
- Yes.

460
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:06,159
I'd have checked in sooner.
This was my first chance.

461
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,515
<i>All right. Go on. </i>

462
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:11,637
They found out about the override.

463
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:00,432
