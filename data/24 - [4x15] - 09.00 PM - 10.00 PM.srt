1
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,950
Jack, look out!

2
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,038
Paul?

3
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,031
Get me a medic.

4
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,917
He's losing pressure.
I need ten cc's of adrenaline.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,389
He was hit before I could do anything.

6
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,277
How bad is it?

7
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,715
We don't know. We just don't know.

8
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,917
Please tell me he's not gonna die.

9
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,308
Why should I help you?

10
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:40,996
I'm offering you freedom. You and Behrooz
will go into a witness protection programme.

11
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,230
You'll be given new names,
identities, everything.

12
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,833
What do you need me to do?

13
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:48,708
I need you to go to Fayed, and tell him
that you need to speak to Marwan.

14
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,793
He won't let me through his front door,
let alone get near Marwan.

15
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,519
He will when you tell him
that you've got a hostage that can help him.

16
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,158
Who?

17
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,593
Me.

18
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,992
- What if Fayed doesn't believe us?
- Then we're both dead.

19
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,632
Close the door.
Put your gun over there. Do it.

20
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,355
What is it?

21
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,476
<i> A woman named</i>
<i>Dina Araz came to me. </i>

22
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,790
- <i>What does she want?</i>
- She has a hostage.

23
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,950
<i>A CTU agent named Jack Bauer. </i>

24
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,915
You've caused me a lot of trouble.

25
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,873
Kill him.

26
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,395
Just what I thought.

27
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,357
Let's go. Come on, let's go.

28
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,717
Meet them at the hotel.

29
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:51,918
I'll need his flight package,
including clearance and identification codes.

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,399
You'll have whatever you need.

31
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:57,234
Get your things.
We've got a plane to catch.

32
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,073
Let me talk to my family.

33
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:03,676
Your family is dead. And so are you.

34
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,194
Edgar, have you found any way
to locate Jack?

35
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,669
We're trying. Marwan covered his tracks.

36
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,116
Michelle.
What do we have, Chloe?

37
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,919
- The PD found the van Jack and Dina were in.
- Where?

38
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,834
Abandoned at an industrial warehouse
at the far end of San Fernando Road.

39
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,115
Dina's body was in it.

40
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,839
OK. Tell local police to look for witnesses.

41
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,957
We need a licence plate,
something to follow. Edgar.

42
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,554
- Pull up satellite from 8:45 to 9:00.
- I'm on it.

43
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,676
All right, everyone, listen up.

44
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,751
Jack Bauer is missing.

45
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:00,549
There's a good chance he's being held
by our primary target, Marwan.

46
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,235
We believe Marwan is preparing
for another domestic attack today.

47
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,959
We need to pool all our resources to find him.

48
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,349
All comm teams, coordinate with Edgar.

49
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,431
Thank you.

50
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,557
- Yes.
- There's a problem.

51
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,436
<i>What?</i>

52
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,876
Got onto the base and through security
using the pilot's ID.

53
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:47,350
As I was about to do a pre-flight check,
they grounded the plane.

54
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,555
Why?

55
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:54,317
Checking a trouble sensor.
They might have to swap out a defective part.

56
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,596
- How long will it take?
- I don't know yet.

57
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,719
Resolve this now.
It's time to earn your money, Mr Anderson.

58
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:09,270
The window of opportunity
on the target closes in an hour.

59
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,351
I understand.

60
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,675
- Excuse me.
- Yes, sir.

61
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:30,712
- You working on the Phoenix?
- Yes, Captain. Sent me down from Hawkins.

62
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,315
- You taking her up?
- What's the ETA on getting me into the air?

63
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,188
The sensor's correct.
There was a hairline fracture on a strut pin.

64
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,238
But, uh, a replacement
won't be until morning.

65
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,311
Is that the only problem? A strut pin?

66
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,756
Yes, but it would be one hell of a problem
when you try to land.

67
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:52,631
Rear assembly would disintegrate on impact.
Only way out would be to parachute out.

68
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,032
- Did you report to the chief officer?
- I'm about to head over there now, Captain.

69
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,953
Then I'm gonna head up to Ventura
for a little R and R.

70
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:04,591
- Sounds great. Don't let me hold you up.
- All right, thanks, sir.

71
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,031
Thanks.

72
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,274
ME says Dina's been dead
less than 30 minutes.

73
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,750
We can only assume that
that's when Marwan grabbed Jack.

74
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:24,719
- What's the search range on Marwan?
- 1500 square miles and increasing.

75
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,789
Chatter?

76
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:29,668
I filtered through everything
from Langley, NSA and Interpol.

77
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,876
- None of it's correlating.
- Volume?

78
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:37,273
It's actually slowing down, which may mean
we've incurred all the damage we will today.

79
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,397
- Or it could be the calm before the storm.
- Yeah.

80
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:44,678
The one thing we know for sure is if Jack's
alive, he'll find a way to contact us.

81
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:49,788
We just have to wait
until we pick up the thread on Marwan.

82
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,951
- Tony.
- Yep?

83
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,476
So I heard Jack called you earlier today.

84
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,152
Yeah.

85
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,674
And that you saved his life.

86
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:07,396
Well, we both know I owed him one, right?

87
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:15,151
Audrey's been waiting
for her husband to get out of surgery.

88
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,073
I think we should tell her about Jack.

89
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,196
Why?

90
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:23,033
- They're involved.
- She's married.

91
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,793
Separated.

92
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,474
- Then I'd prefer not to tell her anything.
- Why?

93
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,677
We may have to make
a very tough call on Jack's capture.

94
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:36,276
She's a professional. She knows it's
a possibility. It'd be wrong to keep it from her.

95
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:40,831
- I don't want her interfering.
- I think she has a right to know.

96
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,829
But, hey, you're the boss. It's your call.

97
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,878
Excuse me.
- How's Paul doing?

98
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:52,112
He's still in surgery.
I won't know until he gets out.

99
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,953
Have you heard anything from Jack?

100
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,035
Jack is missing.

101
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,838
Missing?

102
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,718
We think he was taken by Habib Marwan.

103
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,439
Oh, my God.

104
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,711
- What are we doing to get him back?
- Everything we can.

105
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:13,634
I thought we were tracking him.
He's supposed to be protected.

106
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:18,077
- No one is fully protected in the field.
- Who was in charge of this operation?

107
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,752
I was.

108
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:24,232
Get him back, Michelle.

109
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,036
I have a few questions.

110
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,396
If you answer them, there's a chance
you might survive today.

111
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,675
Don't waste your time.

112
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,035
You located me through a man named Fayed

113
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:54,272
who, you might be interested to know,
has since martyred himself.

114
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:59,434
It would help me if I knew
he was the only link you had to me.

115
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:04,799
Whatever you've planned next is going to fail,
just like everything else you've tried today.

116
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,677
Fail?

117
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:12,710
Almost 40 dead in the train crash, many more
near the San Gabriel Island nuclear plant.

118
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,711
That wasn't really your plan.

119
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,190
We managed to stop the other 103
power plants from melting down.

120
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:21,397
That's what America will remember,
that we stopped you.

121
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:24,916
No, they'll remember the image
of Secretary of Defense Heller

122
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,790
held hostage on your own soil,
and it will burn in their psyches.

123
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:33,350
This country will be afraid
to let their leaders appear in public.

124
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:38,560
For all the hatred that you have for this
country, you don't understand it very well.

125
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,913
Whatever you throw at us, I promise you,

126
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,991
that'll never happen.

127
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,113
- Marwan, we have a problem.
- What is it?

128
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:02,034
- The family of the pilot that we killed.
- What? We disposed of the bodies.

129
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:06,432
Yes. A relative showed up at the house and
became suspicious when no one was home.

130
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:10,115
- He called the police who are looking into it.
- Has it gotten to CTU?

131
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,988
No, but he was a military pilot.
It will be flagged by other agencies

132
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,311
and will get to CTU within the hour.

133
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,470
What do you think we should do?

134
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:23,348
We have to make sure CTU is too busy
to realise its significance.

135
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,431
- Distract them.
- How?

136
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,070
Tell me about the boy.

137
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,276
- What boy?
- Behrooz Araz.

138
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:48,119
- What do you care about him for?
- Does CTU have him in custody?

139
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,794
Yes, he's safe.

140
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,350
You answered the question,
but are you telling me the truth?

141
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,193
Call CTU, ask them yourself.

142
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,951
- <i>Edgar Stiles. </i>
- What's the password for the central server?

143
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,238
- I'll get you on.
- Don't get me on, just give me the password.

144
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:42,471
- It's not your area any more.
- What? You work for me.

145
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,519
No, I worked for you.
Worked, with an "ed" at the end. Past tense.

146
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:50,388
I've been reinstated. Quit being
territorial and give me the password.

147
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,799
No.

148
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:10,031
Curtis, could you please explain to Edgar
that I've been rehired as head of comm?

149
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:15,353
Things have changed, Chloe. Edgar took over
for you. You'll be working for him now.

150
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,389
You're kidding. Michelle called me in because
things were falling apart here under Edgar.

151
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,789
Now, give me my command or I walk.

152
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,509
You have equal authority.
On paper it has to look like you work for him.

153
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:30,957
- I won't do it as a matter of principle.
- You'll be bumped up to a term-four analyst.

154
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,838
That's a 35 per cent increase in salary,
plus bonus.

155
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,469
I should get that anyway.
That's not my point. Edgar works for me.

156
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,869
Not today, Chloe.

157
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:44,391
Fine.
What's the password to the central server?

158
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,755
C- I-S-1-5-A

159
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,149
Thanks.

160
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:54,030
A man who says he's Habib Marwan is on line
one. He wants to speak to the director of CTU.

161
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:58,477
Put it through a high-risk filter,
activate all tracers and recorders. Michelle.

162
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,028
Someone claiming
to be Habib Marwan is on line.

163
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,398
- Are you prepped for the call?
- Yeah, take it there.

164
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,869
Put him through.

165
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:13,270
This is Dessler, Director of CTU.
To whom am I speaking?

166
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,998
This is Habib Marwan.

167
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:18,675
- Jack Bauer is alive and in my custody.
- I'll need to speak to him.

168
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:22,548
I will return him to you unharmed
in exchange for Behrooz Araz.

169
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,996
You have ten minutes
to secure clearances with your people.

170
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,913
- I'd need more time to agree to that.
- Ten minutes.

171
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,120
I will call you then with exact details
on how the exchange is to proceed.

172
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:38,670
Did you get a trace?
OK, confirm Marwan's identity off voice.

173
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,115
And we may need to move Behrooz Araz.

174
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,476
Why is Behrooz Araz
worth trading for Jack?

175
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:50,112
I don't know. Have all tactical teams
meet me in the situation room.

176
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:26,119
Have the police sent the report
about the pilot's missing family to CTU yet?

177
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:30,239
I don't think so, but our contact at LAPD
says the report has been flagged.

178
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,312
It will go out to all the agencies
within 15 minutes.

179
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,437
If CTU gets a hold of it a minute too soon,
they can stop us.

180
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:40,672
- Tell me the second that report gets released.
- Yes, Marwan.

181
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,756
Marwan wants to exchange Jack Bauer
for Behrooz Araz.

182
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:49,436
- The obvious question is why?
- The way I see it, there are two possibilities.

183
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,511
One, there's a personal connection.

184
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,910
Two, Behrooz has information
that can damage Marwan.

185
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,152
I agree. Edgar, have your team sift through
everything we have on Behrooz Araz.

186
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:03,028
Go back as far as you can.
See if there's a family link between them.

187
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,839
Did the interrogation reveal
that he knew anything

188
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,990
that might make him valuable to Marwan?

189
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:11,868
No, but the focus was on the mother.
We really didn't push him very hard.

190
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:15,350
Curtis, push harder.
See what you can find, but do it now.

191
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,035
My guess is Marwan will want
to make this exchange within the hour.

192
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,159
Tony, monitor him from the observation
room. Chloe, what do we have on audio?

193
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:28,633
- The voice print matched. It was Marwan.
- So, how are you gonna handle this?

194
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,918
He thinks his mother made a deal
to protect him. I'll tell him that deal's off.

195
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,436
- The psychological approach is too slow.
- What do you suggest?

196
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:39,830
He'll drag his feet unless we put
some physical pressure on him.

197
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,151
He's a kid. I'm pretty sure
he's given us everything he knows.

198
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,834
You're pretty sure?

199
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,753
- I'll call Richards.
- Tony.

200
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:53,072
- Go ahead, I'll catch up.
- Have you heard anything on Jack?

201
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,549
We got some information
a couple minutes ago.

202
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,996
- Why didn't you let me know?
- Things are going pretty fast here.

203
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:02,231
Look, Jack's alive.
He is being held by Marwan.

204
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,278
- How did you confirm that?
- Marwan contacted us.

205
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,828
He contacted you? Why would he do that?

206
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:13,313
- He wants to make a trade. Jack for Behrooz.
- When is that gonna happen?

207
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,233
- We don't know if it is gonna happen.
- What do you mean?

208
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,471
If he wants to trade,
it means Behrooz has tactical value.

209
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,950
If that's the case,
then we may have to hold on to him.

210
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,350
There's a lot we have to go over
before anything happens.

211
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:31,798
I'll keep you posted, but right now I have
to get in that room with Behrooz, all right?

212
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,110
Thank you.

213
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,669
All right, keep it at that level.

214
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:42,957
Let me know if the readings fluctuate.

215
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,836
- He doesn't know his mother's dead.
- I know.

216
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:04,078
- Hello, Behrooz.
- How much longer do I have to stay here?

217
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,277
- These things take time.
- Where is my mother?

218
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,148
- She's still in the field.
- With Jack Bauer? Is she OK?

219
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,879
Yeah, she's fine.

220
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:24,471
- Tell me about Habib Marwan.
- Why are you doing this?

221
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:29,877
Your mother gave us a little information.
She said you could give us some more.

222
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,952
You promised not to hurt me!
Get this guy away from me!

223
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:37,716
Back over here.
We're just gonna have a little talk.

224
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,360
Marwan's the leader.
That's all I know.

225
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:44,115
I heard my parents talk about him, that's it.

226
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,994
Go ahead.

227
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,275
What are you gonna do?

228
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:59,512
- What is he gonna do to me?
- We don't have a lot of time.

229
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,556
No! No!

230
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,393
No! Please don't do this! Please, no!

231
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,759
This is Marwan.
Get me Michelle Dessler.

232
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:10,035
Ms Dessler, it's Marwan.

233
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,671
Everyone on this!

234
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,032
- This is Dessler.
- Union Conduit Dam, 30 minutes.

235
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,475
I need to know Jack Bauer is still alive.

236
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:30,634
Very well. Michelle Dessler
wants to make sure you're alive.

237
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,952
I'm being held in a warehouse
somewhere downtown.

238
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,996
Satisfied?

239
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:40,709
- I can't make this happen in 30 minutes.
- You'll find a way.

240
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,870
Wait, I...

241
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,549
Dammit.

242
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:49,153
CTU will never go through with the exchange.

243
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,231
I'm expendable.

244
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,356
Yes, you are.

245
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,194
If Behrooz is of value to you,
he's of value to them.

246
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,272
They'll never let you have him back.

247
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,637
Marwan.

248
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:22,915
In the next few minutes CTU will be alerted
that the pilot and his family are missing.

249
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,991
All right.

250
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,552
<i>The LAPD hourlies are here. </i>
<i>What do you do with them?</i>

251
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,313
<i>I promote any flagged items to the analysts. </i>

252
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,516
I can't do that now. I have to get ready.

253
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,354
I can't. I'm tracking Behrooz.
I'd get on those hourlies if I were you.

254
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:50,355
I'll tell Meg to sift through it and deal
with any flagged items after the exchange.

255
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,431
OK, boss.

256
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,154
This is Meg.

257
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:00,550
Hourlies just came in.
Chloe and I need you to sift through them.

258
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,428
- Do you know how backed up we are here?
- It's worse up here. Just do it, OK?

259
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,795
Fine. Send it to four.

260
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:26,597
- Phoenix is ready to go.
- I thought we were waiting on a part.

261
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:31,515
It's a good thing they called me in. That
strut's fine. It was just a faulty trouble sensor.

262
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,670
- You're sure?
- I triple-checked it.

263
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,832
It's just a false alarm. Here's my report.

264
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,512
All right. I'll clear it for takeoff.

265
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,796
- <i> Flight Ops. </i>
- This is Hoader.

266
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,394
Yeah, Phoenix is clear for takeoff.

267
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,471
All right.

268
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,678
- Were you able to narrow it down?
- So far, nothing.

269
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:14,230
We need to get this out
to all departments.

270
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,631
Chloe, what's wrong?

271
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:25,068
Nothing. There's no bad news about Jack,
if that's what you're asking.

272
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:28,277
Since Jack isn't here,
you're the DOD representative.

273
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:32,558
These are some standard nondisclosures.
Read them whenever you get a chance.

274
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:37,236
- I've flagged where you need to sign.
- I'll do that now.

275
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:47,558
- I'm really sorry about your husband.
- Thank you.

276
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,833
I can't imagine how I'd feel
right now if I were you.

277
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,559
I feel like someone
afraid of losing her husband.

278
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:59,714
No, I meant, you know, you and your husband
are separated, and you fall in love with Jack,

279
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:04,476
then your husband takes a bullet that saves
Jack's life. What do you do with that?

280
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:08,075
I can't think about that now.
I just need Paul to pull through this.

281
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:11,072
You just assume
that the terrorists won't kill Jack?

282
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,832
Chloe.

283
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:15,639
I don't wanna talk about it. Here.

284
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:20,191
I was inappropriately blunt, wasn't I?
I do that a lot.

285
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,911
Sorry.

286
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,676
Sorry, I'm gonna go.
I have a... field meeting anyway.

287
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,835
When your father spoke to Marwan,

288
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:43,310
was that on the phone
or did he come to your house?

289
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,789
Both.

290
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:50,192
Did you ever speak to Marwan alone,
away from your parents?

291
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,952
No.

292
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:56,955
When they made the preparations
for today's attacks, were you in the room?

293
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,918
I told you, they didn't want me in there.

294
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,958
Almeida.

295
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:07,636
- <i> Tony, the briefing's about to start. </i>
- All right, I'll be right there.

296
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,518
If he produces something relevant,
let me know.

297
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,591
Yes, sir.

298
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:17,675
O'Brien.

299
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,832
Is anything you're doing
yielding a military connection?

300
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,717
- No, why?
- It may be nothing,

301
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:26,076
but there's an incident report
that might be worth looking at.

302
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,149
What is it?

303
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:31,995
An Air Force pilot's wife and kids were
reported missing as of two hours ago.

304
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,674
How can someone be missing in two hours?

305
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:37,433
I'm just telling you what it says.
Should I run it?

306
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:41,877
- No, we have to do it up here.
- Then why did you send it down here?

307
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,952
- It was Edgar's decision.
- Should I give it to you?

308
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:48,191
I'm the main tactical in the trade for Jack.
Give it to Edgar.

309
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,555
He said he's too busy.

310
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,713
- Just run it through county and get it to him.
- OK.

311
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,469
- Edgar.
- <i>What?</i>

312
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:11,518
Meg found something in the hourlies
I need you to look at.

313
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,556
- I'm preparing.
- <i>Can't Meg do it?</i>

314
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:17,269
It's the job of the lead tactical.
Isn't that what you think you are?

315
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:21,433
- <i>I don't need your sarcasm. I'll take care of it. </i>
- Fantastic.

316
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:33,393
- Hey. Is this briefing about Jack?
Yeah. Marwan called us again.

317
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,471
Has a decision been made?

318
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,949
- It'll be decided in this meeting.
- By whom?

319
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:41,032
Division. Look,
they sent someone down to run point.

320
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,475
Is Division thinking about not doing it?

321
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:46,074
Honestly, it could go either way.

322
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:52,190
But Jack would want us to do what's best
for this country, not what's best for him.

323
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,840
- I know.
- I'll let you know as soon as I can.

324
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:57,115
All right. Thanks, Tony.

325
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,116
Did you get anything out of Behrooz?

326
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:06,432
I don't think he knows anything,
but, uh, Curtis is still trying.

327
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,999
OK. Bill.

328
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:12,120
- Are you up to speed?
- I got briefed on the way.

329
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:16,557
All right, everyone, listen up.
This is Bill Buchanan from Division.

330
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,838
He'll be overseeing the operation.
Run everything through him. Bill?

331
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:25,710
Habib Marwan wants to make an exchange
at the Union Conduit Dam,

332
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,631
Behrooz Araz for Jack Bauer.

333
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:31,918
Now, before we decide whether or not
to go forward, I need to know a few things.

334
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,436
Why does Marwan want the boy?
What's his value?

335
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,751
We could not find evidence
that Behrooz had any information.

336
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:41,912
- Did you push him?
- Yeah. I don't think he knows anything.

337
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:47,279
- Who's doing backgrounds?
- Me. Nothing ties these two people together.

338
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:51,399
Could Behrooz have had something
implanted in his body?

339
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,550
He was scanned when he was brought in.

340
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:56,313
- Did you do an MRI?
Yeah.

341
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,919
I don't like giving him up
unless I know his value.

342
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,560
What happens if we don't
agree to the exchange?

343
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,871
- We don't get Bauer back.
- That can't be the deciding factor.

344
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:10,272
If we don't go through with this,
we may lose an opportunity to trap Marwan.

345
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:13,158
Marwan has to know
that's what we're thinking.

346
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:16,118
The chances of him actually
being present are small.

347
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,715
But we could put a tracer on Behrooz.
He might lead us to Marwan.

348
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:23,793
We tried to trace Dina and Jack.
He grabbed Jack and killed Dina.

349
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:28,908
We'll take a different approach. Two tracers.
One to be found, the other subcutaneous.

350
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,073
- There's no guarantee he won't find that one.
- There are no guarantees.

351
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:36,072
But the fact is we have
no viable leads on Marwan.

352
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:39,311
We have to run with every chance we get.

353
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:46,597
Have tactical finish up the profiles. Let's get
field teams on their way to the dam now.

354
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:51,310
- How do you wanna approach the site?
- We'll figure that out when Marwan calls.

355
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,197
Go.

356
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,837
Yeah.

357
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:06,037
- <i> What's your status?</i>
- Airborne in 30 minutes.

358
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,111
Very well.

359
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,391
Get Bauer.

360
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,072
We've got him.

361
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:14,719
We have to have a satellite repositioned
before the exchange takes place.

362
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:18,588
Edgar, Chloe wants you to take a look at this
when you have the time.

363
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,671
Hang on, let me write that down.

364
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:24,036
Just put it right there. Thank you.

365
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,315
Yeah, OK. Got it.

366
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:39,309
Mrs Raines? The doctor says your husband
should be out of surgery in the next hour.

367
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,994
- How is it going?
- That's all he said.

368
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,071
Thank you.

369
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,838
Audrey.

370
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:51,878
- Any word on Paul?
- We still don't know yet.

371
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:57,273
We've decided to go ahead with the exchange.
We're getting Behrooz ready right now.

372
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,670
- It's not gonna be that simple.
- These things are never simple,

373
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:04,878
but if Marwan really wants the kid,
he's got no reason to hurt Jack.

374
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,952
- And if he doesn't and it's a trap?
- We'll be prepared.

375
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:11,476
- Our field agents have the area fully covered.
- Will you be there?

376
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:17,556
No, I'm gonna be running point from here.
But Curtis will be on the ground.

377
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:22,870
Is the operational objective to get Jack?

378
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,991
No, it isn't.

379
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,751
Audrey...

380
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,880
We have to consider Jack expendable.

381
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:40,676
This thing's about creating
an exposure point for Marwan.

382
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,751
I know.

383
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:50,310
Thank you for being straight with me, Tony.

384
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,111
Look.

385
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,152
Jack's about the only friend I have left,

386
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:00,152
so I'm gonna do everything I can
to keep him safe.

387
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,390
All right?

388
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,277
OK.

389
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:23,477
What are you doing?
Where are you taking me?

390
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:26,996
Habib Marwan offered to exchange
one of our operatives for you.

391
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:31,278
- We accepted that offer.
- What? What does he want with me?

392
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:35,751
We don't know. We'll be behind you every
step, and recover you as soon as possible.

393
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,559
Does my mother know about this?

394
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,517
Yes.

395
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:45,711
You made a deal with her,
to put us both in witness protection.

396
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:49,679
- We'll do everything to abide by that deal.
- Then don't do this!

397
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,557
That's not an option.

398
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:56,149
- Now put this watch on.
- No.

399
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:01,910
- Get off me!
- These devices will help us track you.

400
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,994
And I give you my word,
I'll do everything in my power for you.

401
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,475
Hang on. This will sting.

402
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:16,079
It's a microtracker, implanted under your skin.

403
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,151
You don't care about me,

404
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,670
or your word.

405
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:23,513
You're just using me.

406
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,471
Let's go.

407
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,508
I need you to sterilise a video feed to the van.

408
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,989
I got teams that need tactical uploads.

409
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:42,517
These hourlies need are 30 minutes past due.
And now I gotta put video together?

410
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:46,593
- Video's a priority. I'll see to the uploads.
- What about the hourlies?

411
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:52,117
Get on it as soon as the link's in place.

412
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,750
- Is it working?
- The red dot is the decoy.

413
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:05,515
When they remove the watch,
we can still trace the tracker in his neck.

414
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,876
Edgar, make sure all cellular stations
are put on autotrace.

415
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,949
Got it.

416
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:13,191
When our vehicles are two miles
from the dam, have them hold.

417
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,669
Nobody goes in until we hear from Marwan.

418
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:19,435
Castle's team will be there as soon
as possible. Behrooz is on his way.

419
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:22,318
We don't have time
to make sure it's not a trap.

420
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:25,358
We don't have a choice.

421
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,113
- CTU, Edgar Stiles.
- This is Marwan. Get Dessler.

422
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,395
Ms Dessler, it's Marwan.

423
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,113
- Dessler.
- I'll give you final instructions now.

424
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:41,317
Make sure you follow them implicitly.
Are you ready?

425
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:44,392
- Go ahead.
- How are you transporting Behrooz?

426
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,710
- In one of our tactical vehicles.
- Good.

427
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:51,191
Now, approach via the Frontage Road.
Pull up at the back gate of the dam,

428
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:54,716
and have Behrooz get out by himself
and walk toward the gate.

429
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:58,236
- A van will be there to pick him up.
- What about Jack Bauer?

430
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,709
<i>He'll be in the van. </i>

431
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:05,952
That doesn't work for me.
I wanna see Jack before I give up Behrooz.

432
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,508
- That's acceptable.
- <i>And I want him unharmed. </i>

433
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:11,558
- Your boy scout is just fine.
- OK.

434
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:14,712
Remember, Behrooz gets out by himself.

435
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:18,349
If any of your agents interfere, Bauer dies.

436
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:21,352
- Understood.
- Don't be late.

437
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:26,878
- Our vehicle's five minutes away.
- Then we'll see you in five minutes.

438
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:31,511
- That should keep them busy.
- What do you want to do about Bauer?

439
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,990
As soon as we have Behrooz, we kill Bauer.

440
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:23,240
- Who's going to protect me?
- We are. That's why we put trackers on you.

441
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:26,437
You don't think Marwan will find them?
He will.

442
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:29,318
Hopefully it won't
come to that, Behrooz.

443
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:32,278
What does that mean?

444
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:35,670
We're gonna have the area surrounded.
We will protect you.

445
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,991
Why would you protect me?
I'm nothing to you people.

446
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:41,594
You think I'm a terrorist.

447
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,910
I don't believe you are.

448
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:50,119
If Marwan is going to be there,
why don't you grab him when we get there?

449
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,236
He's probably not gonna be there.

450
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:56,598
- We need you to lead us to him.
- Oh, God.

451
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:59,319
- It's gonna be all right.
- It's not.

452
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,316
- I'm in position.
- Does CTU have anyone there yet?

453
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:13,155
Rasheed has spotted vehicles at the edge of
the access road. We think it might be them.

454
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:18,030
OK. Wait until the exchange,
then I'll give you the word to take out Bauer.

455
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:20,429
<i>All right. </i>

456
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:24,752
Once the trade is made, how much longer
do we need to keep CTU distracted?

457
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:27,912
Ideally until we hit the target,
but as long as possible.

458
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,596
And what should my men do
with Behrooz once we have him?

459
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:34,796
I haven't decided yet.

460
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,118
- Yes.
- They are here.

461
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,589
Good. Send in the van.

462
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,996
I don't wanna do this. I'm afraid.

463
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:15,312
- We'll be behind you every step of the way.
- What good is that if he wants me dead?

464
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:20,793
He's not going through all this
just so he can kill you. All right?

465
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,550
All right, the van's here.

466
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,435
Come on, move it.

467
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:48,319
- I see Jack.
- We could converge on them now.

468
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,234
Is there any indication that Marwan
has other personnel in the area?

469
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,073
No, just the van.

470
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:58,429
Marwan's not gonna be there.

471
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:02,274
If we close in now,
they could take the van out themselves.

472
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,669
We proceed.

473
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:09,311
- Curtis, it's a go.
- All right. I'm sending Behrooz.

474
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,789
Go ahead. It's all right.

475
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,471
Go.

476
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:41,916
Is my mother in the van?
She was working with you. Where is she?

477
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,878
- I don't know.
- I don't wanna die.

478
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,714
<i> They have Behrooz. </i>
<i>Bauer's in my sights. </i>

479
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,836
Take him out.

480
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,832
No!

481
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:05,314
Sniper's down! Move out!
Take cover!

482
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,234
Why'd you give 'em that kid?

483
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,788
He's double-tagged.
We'll be tracking him.

484
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:14,633
All right, you two, secure the area!

485
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,711
Let's go.

486
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,518
Almeida.

487
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:30,990
- Tony, it's Jack.
- I've got Buchanan here. You're on speaker.

488
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,513
- OK.
- You OK?

489
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:36,639
Fine. I need you to pick up a phone matrix
within a 20-mile radius of the dam.

490
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:41,157
- What are you thinking?
- I managed to short-circuit some phone lines.

491
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:45,836
If you can find two service obstructions at
the same coordinates, we can get to Marwan.

492
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:49,356
- I'm opening up an interface now.
- We don't have a lot of time.

493
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,193
Marwan's not gonna stay
at the building for long.

494
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:55,590
We have tactical teams ready.
I'll reposition for assault.

495
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:59,036
- OK. I know the layout. I'll run point.
- <i>Copy that. </i>

496
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:02,631
The van's heading west.
Both trackers are registering.

497
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:06,998
- Good. Let me know if anything changes.
- OK, I will.

498
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,872
Marwan, we have the boy.

499
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,430
<i> They will have placed</i>
<i>tracking devices on him. Find them. </i>

500
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:20,479
- We are looking for them now.
- <i>When you destroy them, report back to me. </i>

501
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,710
Very well.

502
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:32,310
- Where is my mother?
- Your mother is dead.

503
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:37,035
No.

504
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,315
I don't believe you.

505
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:54,034
What are you gonna do to me? No!

506
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:59,718
Curtis.

507
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:03,031
- They found the decoy.
- How's the injected device looking?

508
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:05,111
Still tracking.

509
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,711
Wait. No, it's not!

510
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:13,439
- <i>They must have found it. </i>
- Damn. Can you get me a visual on the van?

511
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,238
Hold on.

512
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,750
Yeah.
- <i>We need a satellite pumped into the servers. </i>

513
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:29,070
- I got something you should see.
- <i>Later. </i>

514
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:32,550
We need that satellite to find
Behrooz Araz before they kill him.

515
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,631
<i>I'm on it. </i>

516
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:07,438
We have a location from the phone company -
where Marwan was holding Jack.

517
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:11,718
Edgar, download these coordinates
to tactical right now.

518
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:16,836
Our window's closing.
We will only have this one opportunity.

519
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:22,916
- <i>You've gotta get into the air now. </i>
- No problem. I'm ready and on the move.

520
