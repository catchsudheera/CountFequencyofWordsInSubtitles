1
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,557
<i>Previously on 24:</i>

2
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:17,714
<i>- Almeida.
- Tony, it's me. Gael's dead.</i>

3
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,674
He was suffering so badly. No one
should have to go through what he did.

4
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,554
There are children upstairs
who are going to die in agony.

5
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,240
Unfortunately,
there's nothing we can do for them.

6
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,276
Actually, there is.

7
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:36,469
Suicide capsules.
For the people down at the hotel.

8
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,309
- It's against every regulation in the book.
- Yeah.

9
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,156
Do it.

10
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,396
Get down!

11
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,952
Saunders' computer file.
What server did you store it on?

12
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,479
A 5.

13
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,394
Chase. We got a bomb.

14
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,511
- How much time?
- None.

15
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,517
I got it. Go! Go!

16
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:06,275
Chappelle.

17
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,678
Ryan, it's Jack. Almost the entire Ml6 office
has been wiped out.

18
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,873
One of the things Saunders was trying to
destroy was the information Ml6 had on him.

19
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,833
I retrieved the hard drive.
Got anything yet?

20
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,677
I'm following the money trail.

21
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,360
- What do you want?
- To give you your next assignment.

22
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:25,876
There's a man named Ryan Chappelle,
regional director of CTU.

23
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,793
- I want him killed.
- It's out of the question.

24
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,472
Before you decide,

25
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,673
you might want to drop by the Chandler
Plaza Hotel, look at what's happening.

26
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,839
Then imagine the same taking place
at hundreds of locations all over the country.

27
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,598
You're insane.

28
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:49,594
The following takes place
between 6am and 7am.

29
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,880
This office isn't above the law. How can
I authorize the murder of an innocent man?

30
00:01:55,915 --> 00:02:00,590
David, we're fighting a war.
Ryan Chappelle is not a civilian.

31
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:04,434
I still can't order him to be killed.

32
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,376
So what's the alternative?
Yes, David, I know it's extreme, I realize that.

33
00:02:09,411 --> 00:02:14,192
But it's the only move we have. Look at
what's happening at the Chandler Plaza.

34
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,550
Saunders has proven he will use this virus

35
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,719
to inflict mass casualties
if you don't do what he says.

36
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,389
How long am I supposed
to let Saunders dictate my actions?

37
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,592
- How long does he hold us hostage?
- Until we catch him.

38
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,188
- And what if we don't?
- We will.

39
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:35,155
But until we do your only
option is to sacrifice Chappelle.

40
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,559
The hard drive from Ml6 is at the IT lab.
They're sorting the data now.

41
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,117
- London wants you to debrief them on Ml6.
- Are we any closer to finding Saunders?

42
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,845
He's using a scrambler
to contact the president.

43
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:59,158
- It could take 24 hours to trace.
- That's the only search we've got going?

44
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,880
Saunders transferred money
to Amador using a server in Los Angeles.

45
00:03:02,915 --> 00:03:06,156
I'm following Amador's money
to see if it leads to Saunders.

46
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,396
- You haven't turned up anything.
- No.

47
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,717
The computer we confiscated
from the "Go" club is a dead end.

48
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,513
I'm back-tracing Saunders' offshore accounts.

49
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,870
- OK, fine.
- Jack, the president's holding.

50
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,873
- Transfer it here.
- He has to speak to you in private.

51
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,430
He's on the line at station seven.

52
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,596
Excuse me.

53
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:38,433
<i>- This is Bauer.
- Agent Bauer, please hold for the president.</i>

54
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,791
<i>Mr President, I have Jack Bauer for you.</i>

55
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,845
- Jack?
- Mr President?

56
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,269
- Are you alone right now?
- Yes, sir.

57
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,960
Saunders called. He's made another demand.

58
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,918
What is it?

59
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:59,949
This is a hard one, Jack.
So I'm gonna be as direct as I can be.

60
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:05,232
- He wants Ryan Chappelle dead.
- I'm sorry, I don't understand.

61
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,797
- He wants his body at the train yard.
- Why would Saunders want Chappelle dead?

62
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:15,637
<i>He wouldn't say. But he was emphatic about
the consequences if his demand wasn't met.</i>

63
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:22,880
Jack, I feel as though I'm crossing a line
that I will never be able to step back from.

64
00:04:22,915 --> 00:04:25,440
So then you've made your decision, sir.

65
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,952
Unless you can suggest a way to handle this.

66
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,845
- What time is this supposed to happen?
- Seven o'clock.

67
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,880
- We need to find Saunders before then.
- That's in less than an hour.

68
00:04:38,915 --> 00:04:41,872
- Yes, I know, sir. I should get going.
- Jack.

69
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,355
I'm sorry to put this on you,
but I didn't know who else to call.

70
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,870
I understand, sir. I'll get back to you.

71
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:57,077
Chloe, what are you doing
right now to help find Saunders?

72
00:04:57,112 --> 00:05:00,395
- We're relaying our data streams to Division.
- Why there?

73
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,637
They're the hub now.
They gather information for us...

74
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:08,550
- Forget that. Search from here.
- What kind of search?

75
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,636
What's the largest base
of knowledge on Saunders?

76
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,512
- Financial.
- Follow the banks.

77
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,996
- I'll have to clear it with Chappelle.
- No, you can't do that.

78
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,276
He gave the order. He outranks you.

79
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,517
Do what I ask you.
And don't let Chappelle know, you got it?

80
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,955
No, I don't. He's mad at me already. I'm not...

81
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,349
Chloe!

82
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:31,471
Chloe, I wouldn't ask you to do it
like this if it wasn't very important.

83
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,398
OK? So please, just do this for me.

84
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,757
- Fine.
- Thank you.

85
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,997
Nearly a third are symptomatic,
and it's getting worse.

86
00:05:53,032 --> 00:05:56,395
<i>They should have the choice
to end their own lives.</i>

87
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,875
The capsules should be there soon.

88
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,599
Tony?

89
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,636
<i>Yeah?</i>

90
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,845
I realize we've both been
talking around this, but...

91
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:13,873
<i>- if my test comes back positive...
- Michelle, don't go there.</i>

92
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:19,473
Sweetheart, we both know
my chances of survival are low.

93
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:24,794
You still have a chance, and while there's
still a chance, I don't want to talk about this.

94
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,440
OK. Just...

95
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:33,759
No matter what, I just want you to know...

96
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:38,431
the last three years
have been the best years of my life.

97
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,872
I should be there with you.

98
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:47,839
- You are.
- No. It's not the same.

99
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:58,159
The best thing you can do for me right now
is to make sure those capsules get here.

100
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,038
I'll do my best.

101
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,869
I know you will.

102
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,919
Tony, I need to speak to you.

103
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,836
- Michelle?
- Yeah.

104
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:34,876
- Did she get her test results back yet?
- No, they won't be back for another hour yet.

105
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,509
What's going on?

106
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:41,589
Do you know if Saunders and Chappelle had
any history, if their paths had ever crossed?

107
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:46,111
Not that I'm aware.
What kind of connection you looking for?

108
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,796
The kind that would make
Saunders want Chappelle killed.

109
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,880
Cos that's what he just
ordered the president to do.

110
00:07:52,915 --> 00:07:56,111
By 7am he wants Ryan Chappelle dead.

111
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,232
- Why?
- That's what I'm trying to figure out.

112
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,873
And the president put this on you?

113
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,676
I don't know what I'm gonna do
if we don't find Saunders by seven.

114
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,030
Have you told Ryan about this?

115
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,549
No, not yet.

116
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,875
I should change his clearance before you do.

117
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,117
- You think he's a flight risk?
- We can't take a chance now.

118
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:29,798
I'll get Chappelle to send his data to Chloe.
Prep her and whoever you can spare to sort it.

119
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:33,668
- They'll want to know what's going on.
- They don't need to know.

120
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,234
- I'll take care of it.
- Thank you.

121
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,553
<i>- Field Ops. O'Brian.
- Chloe.</i>

122
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,916
<i>- Put all protocols on hold for the next hour.
- Got it.</i>

123
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,032
- OK.
- All right.

124
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,880
What did the president
want to talk to you about?

125
00:08:49,915 --> 00:08:51,711
You.

126
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,910
Me? What about me?

127
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,996
Ryan, come with me.

128
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,836
Just take a seat.

129
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,836
- What's going on here?
- Saunders has another demand.

130
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,871
What does he want now?

131
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,076
Jack.

132
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,839
He wants you killed.

133
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,713
- Is this some kind of a joke?
- It's no joke.

134
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:33,154
He's threatened to release the virus into
the population unless we deliver you by 7am.

135
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:36,716
Did Palmer actually go along with this?

136
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,269
My God, Jack.

137
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,068
He'll use the virus.
The president had no choice.

138
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,192
- He sent you to kill me?
- Not if we can find Saunders by 7am.

139
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:49,871
Ah, great.
That gives us a lot of time, doesn't it?

140
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,109
- I don't understand. Why me?
- We don't know.

141
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,233
Think hard. Do you have any connection
with Saunders we don't know about?

142
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:03,150
No. The first time I heard
the name Stephen Saunders was today.

143
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,198
The transactions
you investigated triggered this.

144
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,276
I haven't traced them to Saunders yet.

145
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,870
The fact that he wants you dead
proves that they lead back to him.

146
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,845
And you expect
to figure this out by seven o'clock?

147
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,270
Finding Saunders in time
is the only way to keep you alive.

148
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:22,393
And I will use everything
at my disposal to do that.

149
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,350
Ryan, I need your help.

150
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:31,910
I need all your files, everything, sent over
to Chloe so she can start going through it.

151
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,235
I'm sorry, Ryan.

152
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,836
Let's find this guy.

153
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,875
- What have you got?
- I've found Saunders' offshore bank account.

154
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:28,790
I accessed his account off their network,
but it's encrypted. Another brick wall.

155
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,440
Send it to Chloe.
If anyone can break it, she can.

156
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,035
- Not in the time we have.
- You don't know that.

157
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,870
It has to be now, Jack, now.
This is it. Don't you understand?

158
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:44,072
Oh, of course you understand.
You're the one who's gonna kill me.

159
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,431
We're doing everything we can.

160
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,958
Don't you realize the possibility
that this might not even be relevant?

161
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:55,231
Saunders knows killing me
doesn't kill the investigation.

162
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,396
It might be something else I know,

163
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:01,354
- that I haven't made a connection with yet.
- Then, think, Ryan, think.

164
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:08,312
But don't give in to this bastard. With all of us
working together, we're gonna find this guy.

165
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:13,309
Send the encrypted account over
to Chloe's desk. I'll explain it to her. Come on.

166
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,069
Chloe. Ryan's forwarding a file to you.

167
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,870
Please let me... let me call my wife.

168
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:53,475
We're under orders to keep this secret,
so we don't create a panic.

169
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:58,196
Yeah, I won't tell her anything,
and your people can listen in.

170
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,959
That order comes directly from the president.

171
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:05,039
I have done everything
I can do to help you. Please.

172
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,592
I just want to... I just want to hear her voice.
Please.

173
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,991
I'm sorry.

174
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,317
- Sir?
- I'm so sorry.

175
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,039
There you go.

176
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,313
Can I have your attention, please?

177
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:40,880
What I'm about to tell you
will be difficult to hear.

178
00:13:40,915 --> 00:13:43,519
But it's important
you have all the information,

179
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:46,518
so you can each make your own decision.

180
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,551
First, I want all of you to know that...

181
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:59,153
once symptoms of infection appear,
there is no chance of recovery.

182
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:06,237
As the virus progresses, it attacks
the body's organs and major blood vessels.

183
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,555
This process is extremely painful.

184
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:14,434
The estimated time of death
is within six hours.

185
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,599
I'm telling you all of this
as directly as possible because...

186
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,156
we can offer each of you an alternative.

187
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:28,276
Some pills that you can take that will
make you feel like you're going to sleep.

188
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,479
It will be up to each
one of you to decide when,

189
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,717
and if, you want to use these drugs.

190
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,873
They will be available shortly.

191
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,589
Thank you.

192
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,596
Michelle, we have a situation.

193
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:58,236
A woman told us she can't find the man she
was here with. She hasn't seen him for hours.

194
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:01,238
- Sure he's not in isolation?
- Yeah, we let her look.

195
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,114
- What's his name?
- That's the problem. She doesn't know.

196
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:12,470
- I'm Agent Michelle Dessler.
- I'm Kathy, Kathy McCartney.

197
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,751
You realize how important
it is we account for everyone?

198
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:20,237
- Yes. That's why I came forward.
- We need you to be completely honest.

199
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:25,388
I am. All I know is that his name is Bill,
and I'm not even sure if that's real.

200
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,913
What do you mean?

201
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:33,513
We met tonight at a club on Hill, and we really
connected, so we decided to come here.

202
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:36,029
- Who booked the room?
- I did.

203
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,230
When was the last time you saw him?

204
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:42,751
We fell asleep in the room, and when
the fire alarm woke me up, he was gone.

205
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:49,393
- Do you remember what time you fell asleep?
- I know, I looked at the clock. It was 4.02.

206
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,869
Stay here, please.

207
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,473
Sunny.

208
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,718
If she's right, then this man was
in the hotel when the virus was released,

209
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,678
and he got out of the building
before it was locked down.

210
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,791
Is it possible he's in the hotel?

211
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,952
No. No. We've accounted
for everyone in the guest rooms,

212
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:09,789
and we've done an infrared
sweep of all the public areas.

213
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:13,916
Ed. Get a forensic team up to her room.
Dust for prints.

214
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,156
- There'll be dozens of prints.
- Do it.

215
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,475
This is Miller. We need a forensic team.

216
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,955
- Kathy. I need you to come with me.
- Why?

217
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:26,359
You need to show me every surface
that Bill may have touched. Come on.

218
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,192
Thanks.

219
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:35,837
Chloe needs processing power. I need you to
open up another socket in the network for her.

220
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,916
How's he doing?

221
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,559
He's scared.

222
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:44,996
Chase has a strike team ready to go
as soon as we get a location.

223
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,715
I ordered a helicopter from Air Tactical.
Train yard's across town.

224
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,513
- We can't be slowed down by traffic.
- OK, good.

225
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,995
- I'll get the socket open for Chloe.
- Thanks.

226
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,908
Jack. The bank used deep encryption.
We'll have to use a password crack.

227
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,996
- How long?
- It could take 90 minutes.

228
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,350
- We don't have time.
- I'm doing my best.

229
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,040
Maybe if you told us why
this overrides our protocol...

230
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,429
All you need to know is,
I need these files now.

231
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,358
I'm doing my best.
Your tone is not a morale booster.

232
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,789
Chloe, please, just do it.

233
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,437
- Let me help with the parallel processing.
- Good idea.

234
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,516
Send it to my station.

235
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,355
Ryan.

236
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:43,239
I'm sorry, Mr Chappelle.
We can't let you leave.

237
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,749
- What?
- Please return to CTU, sir.

238
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,871
- Who the hell do...
- We have orders.

239
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,436
From who? I'm regional director,
I countermand any order given.

240
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:54,996
<i>-  Ryan.
- What the hell's going on here, Jack?</i>

241
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,590
Why aren't I being allowed
to leave the building?

242
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,114
You think I'm trying to run?

243
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:09,991
I'm going out to smoke a cigarette. I wouldn't
condemn millions to death so I could live.

244
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,680
Let me see the cigarettes.

245
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,553
These men will escort you back to holding.

246
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,592
- I don't think so.
- I'm not asking, Ryan.

247
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:27,670
Under the authority given to me by the
President of the United States, I order you.

248
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:04,710
Tony, we have a problem. We determined
a man who was exposed to the virus got out.

249
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,876
Son of a bitch! How'd that happen?

250
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:11,597
Got out before we reinforced the perimeter.
Probably didn't know he'd been exposed.

251
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,845
Have you notified Health Services?

252
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,845
They're aware.
The problem is, we don't know who he is.

253
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,880
- He wasn't a registered guest.
- What was he doing inside the hotel?

254
00:19:20,915 --> 00:19:24,350
Having a one-night stand.
The woman he was with came forward.

255
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,237
Any sign of him on the cameras?

256
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:29,716
Nothing at the front desk,
and no one saw him come or go.

257
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,752
- What are we doing to find him?
- Our best shot is prints.

258
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,589
We've pulled dozens from
the light switches, bathroom fixtures.

259
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,880
Send the prints to us.
See what else you can get from this woman.

260
00:19:39,915 --> 00:19:42,553
Got it.

261
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,193
- Sorry I can't be more helpful.
- You're doing great.

262
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:52,393
Let's just go over this one more time.
The two of you came into the room.

263
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:55,876
I had the key,
so I'm the one who opened the door.

264
00:19:56,120 --> 00:20:00,113
- We didn't turn the lights on or off.
- Did he go to the window, draw the blinds?

265
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,515
No, we just started kissing right away.

266
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:07,310
- And where were you standing?
- I was here, by the bed.

267
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,917
- And then what happened?
- He started taking my clothes off.

268
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:15,199
- The clothes you're wearing now?
- Yeah. He pulled my shirt over my head,

269
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:18,676
- and then my pants, and then...
- I need your belt.

270
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,871
Miller, try the buckle.

271
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:34,280
Couple of prints look like hers.

272
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,598
- Hold it. I got a partial thumb.
- It's not hers?

273
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,845
Checking.

274
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,792
No. She's got inverse swirls.
This print doesn't.

275
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,916
Upload it to CTU. Now.

276
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:55,190
If we don't find this guy before he becomes
symptomatic, we might have an outbreak.

277
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,871
Where have you been?

278
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,676
I had a client meeting. I told you that I
wouldn't come home if it went too late.

279
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:28,833
That's right. Kinda wish
you would have called, I was worried.

280
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,394
I didn't want to wake you up.

281
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:54,510
Jack, I think I'm getting something.
Applying last layer keywords.

282
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,592
We cracked it.
We have access to Saunders' bank account.

283
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,679
- Tell me what address they've got on him.
- Several, one in Los Angeles.

284
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:05,832
- An apartment five minutes away.
- How do we know it's real?

285
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,872
When money is moved,
the location of the call is confirmed.

286
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,878
Saunders called 45 minutes ago,
from that address.

287
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,880
- I'll call Chase.
- He can't let Saunders see us.

288
00:22:14,915 --> 00:22:17,792
Good work. Great work. Thank you.

289
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,676
Open it.

290
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,876
- Ryan, I think we've found Saunders.
- Through his bank account?

291
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:30,750
45 minutes ago he called from an apartment
near here. Chase is leading a team there now.

292
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,589
Good, Jack. Thank God.

293
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,994
Ryan.

294
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:40,029
- We still need to go to the train yard.
- Now? What are you talking about?

295
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:43,909
We have to be in place,
in case the strike team isn't successful.

296
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,845
But you said they know
he was there 45 minutes ago.

297
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:51,795
This is just a precaution. We have to do it
until we have him in custody, you know that.

298
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:55,111
I've got a helicopter waiting for us,
but we should go now.

299
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,396
- All right, Jack.
- OK.

300
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,515
- We'll be in touch as soon as we're airborne.
- All right.

301
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:19,110
Mr Chappelle, Division confirmed
your three o'clock briefing. That OK?

302
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,998
Sure.

303
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:42,435
<i>Mr President. Helen Stoopen
from the LA Timesjust called my office.</i>

304
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:47,111
She was asking about some kind of toxic
accident at the Chandler Plaza Hotel,

305
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:51,399
- and if it was connected to the red alert.
- What exactly did she say?

306
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,557
Not much. She was fishing.

307
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,919
I appreciate you need to keep things
from me, but this story will get out,

308
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:05,079
- and when it does I'll need to have answers.
- Jerry's right, David.

309
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:09,153
The sooner we bring him into the loop,
the better he can handle the press.

310
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:18,874
A weaponized virus was released
into that hotel's ventilation system.

311
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,516
Oh, my God.

312
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,551
When will you go public with this?

313
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:33,719
Once we're sure the virus has been contained,
and there's no longer a threat.

314
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:38,868
- Are you certain that it will be contained?
- We're doing everything possible.

315
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,871
Yes, sir.

316
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,034
Jack. Tony said you're not
coming with me to get Saunders.

317
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:09,950
- You and Baker head up the strike team.
- I don't understand. Saunders is the priority.

318
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:14,835
I've ordered Jack downtown
to answer a few more questions.

319
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:19,632
You know what, Ryan?
All you do is put obstacles in our way.

320
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:23,230
We need our best people.
You tie us down with your bureaucratic BS.

321
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,511
Chase.

322
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,996
Those are the orders.

323
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:36,752
- What's going on, Jack?
- Just take care of the strike team.

324
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:56,872
<i>-  Any sign that he's in there?
-  I can't get a visual inside.</i>

325
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:09,845
- Three men outside the building.
- We can take 'em out with a sniper.

326
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:14,192
No, we can't. If we miss, Saunders will
know we're here. I want to do this up close.

327
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:18,880
- It's in the open. They'll see us a block away.
- That's why he picked the place.

328
00:27:18,915 --> 00:27:23,874
I don't see how we get to them
before they can warn Saunders.

329
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,871
I do.

330
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:36,351
- They're grounding flights from LAX.
- Did the couriers get out with their vials?

331
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:40,753
New York, Washington, San Francisco
made it through. They're on their way.

332
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:46,796
I rerouted Las Vegas, our man is driving there
now. But we missed Chicago and Cleveland.

333
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,871
Did you revise the casualty projections?

334
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,845
- Of course. Here they...
- Just give me the number.

335
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:57,398
- Two to five million dead within 48 hours.
- Good enough.

336
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,880
There is a chance the outbreak
will spread beyond the Americas.

337
00:28:00,915 --> 00:28:03,792
We'll be fine, don't worry.

338
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:16,874
Tony. We got results back
on the fingerprint from the hotel.

339
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:20,845
- What you got?
- For a complete print, there'd be one match.

340
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:25,078
But it's a partial, so we get results from
anyone whose prints match that quadrant.

341
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,919
How many potential matches
we talking about?

342
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:32,318
The FBI database gave
us almost 300 possibilities.

343
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,397
Upload the pictures to the hotel,
have that woman check 'em.

344
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:40,752
- OK, I'm on it.
- Tony. Ryan Chappelle on line three.

345
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,155
<i> Ryan?</i>

346
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:52,033
What's taking Edmunds so long?
Has he called in yet?

347
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,879
He's moving into position
around the building.

348
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:57,434
Why are they waiting?
Why haven't they gone in?

349
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:00,154
They're preparing a covert entry. Takes time.

350
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,999
Well, get on 'em, Tony.
Get them into that building.

351
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,510
<i>Chase is running this operation.
He needs to make this call.</i>

352
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,990
Ryan, Chase knows what's at stake here.

353
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:12,351
He's gonna go in when it's safe.
Just try and relax.

354
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,516
<i>- Ryan, you still there?
- I'm here.</i>

355
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:19,356
- I'll hook you up to the real-time com feed.
- Good.

356
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:23,509
<i>- Tony, I've got a visual on the train yard.
- Copy that.</i>

357
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:10,236
<i> No one in the lobby.
Baker and I are moving up the stairs.</i>

358
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:14,399
<i>Grahams and Martinez
are coming down from the roof.</i>

359
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:48,352
<i>The guard at the top of the stairs has been
taken out. Proceeding down the hall.</i>

360
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:08,670
You got one man by the door.
We're gonna have to move fast. My lead.

361
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,595
Set.

362
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:40,874
- Clear.
- No one's here.

363
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:50,396
It's a switching node.

364
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:54,069
<i> He's been relaying calls
from this location. Dammit!</i>

365
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:28,919
- This is Bauer.
- You underestimate me, Jack.

366
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,553
Why are you doing this?

367
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:33,035
Even if I told you, you wouldn't understand.

368
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,752
Try me.

369
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:39,516
Tell your people not to bother tracing
that relay. I've switched to another node.

370
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:43,991
- Stephen.
- A van will be arriving shortly.

371
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:49,240
Leave Chappelle's body with the driver.
Do not attempt to follow the van.

372
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:55,873
If you don't follow my directions,
I will release the virus immediately.

373
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:35,877
Can I have everyone's attention, please?

374
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:39,516
These are the drugs
Agent Dessler told you about earlier.

375
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:44,475
Anyone who wants to exercise
this option can step forward.

376
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,476
Thank you.

377
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,112
- Michelle.
- Did you find a match?

378
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:20,870
Partial print gave us a few hundred possibles,
which we narrowed down to a dozen men.

379
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:23,873
Ms McCartney's looking at 'em now.

380
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:27,315
That's not him.

381
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,359
No.

382
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,713
No.

383
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,514
- This one. I think that's him.
- Are you sure?

384
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,875
Yeah. I'm sure.

385
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,436
Find him.

386
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:53,234
<i> Are you OK, William?
You've been in there for a while.</i>

387
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:57,148
- Uh, I have some kind of bug.
- Do you want me to make some tea?

388
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,436
No, I'm fine.

389
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,790
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

390
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,871
Yeah, I gotta go to the office.

391
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:07,873
- I have a staff meeting.
- OK.

392
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:30,192
<i>Kaufman.</i>

393
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,754
This is Jack.
Have you got satellite coverage?

394
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,678
- Not yet, I'll reposition.
- Black van, no plates.

395
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:38,155
Do everything you can to follow it.

396
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,474
OK.

397
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,433
- We have to go, Ryan.
- Yeah.

398
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:11,793
- My legs are shaking.
- I've got you.

399
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:36,912
Ryan, is there anyone you want to talk to?

400
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:39,390
What do you mean, to say goodbye?

401
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,590
To say whatever you have to.

402
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:47,593
I have a brother I haven't spoken to in years.

403
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:54,793
I don't have that many friends.
Just the people at work.

404
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:58,634
So, no. There's no one.

405
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:06,310
I'm sorry, Ryan, we gotta do this.

406
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,396
Get on your knees.

407
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:18,878
All right, there's no way around this,
right, Jack? We don't have any outs here.

408
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,876
Not that I can see.

409
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,798
Wait.

410
00:38:26,833 --> 00:38:28,836
I...

411
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:32,314
Let me do this myself.

412
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:38,310
At least give me the dignity of taking
my own life. That's something you can do.

413
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:41,830
- No, Ryan, I can't do that.
- Yes, you can.

414
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:46,829
You were right, back at CTU, to put me under
watch. I wasn't going out for a cigarette.

415
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:50,873
I was trying to bolt.
But I know this has to happen.

416
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:56,553
I can't take that chance.

417
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,830
I'm giving you my word, Jack.

418
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:03,631
I won't run. I swear.

419
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:09,590
I-I'd be lying if I said I wasn't scared,
but I'm not gonna run.

420
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:15,875
I couldn't live with myself, knowing I was
responsible for the deaths of all those people.

421
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,871
You've gotta believe me.

422
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,872
I can't. I can't.

423
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,516
It's all right.

424
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,872
I'm sorry we let you down, Ryan.

425
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,956
God forgive me.
