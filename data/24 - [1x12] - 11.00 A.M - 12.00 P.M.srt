1
00:00:13,133 --> 00:00:18,002
Right now, terrorists are plotting
to assassinate a presidential candidate.

2
00:00:18,413 --> 00:00:21,485
My wife and daughter have been kidnapped.

3
00:00:21,573 --> 00:00:24,645
And people that I work with
may be involved in both.

4
00:00:25,413 --> 00:00:30,692
I'm Federal Agent Jack Bauer.
This is the longest day of my life.

5
00:00:34,253 --> 00:00:35,686
What's this about Ferragamo?

6
00:00:35,773 --> 00:00:38,571
What difference does it make,
if you're protected?

7
00:00:38,653 --> 00:00:41,042
What difference?
That someone may be murdered?

8
00:00:41,133 --> 00:00:45,365
Power has a price and that price
has to be paid. Always.

9
00:00:45,773 --> 00:00:48,845
What are we supposed to do?
Shoot our way out?

10
00:00:48,933 --> 00:00:53,006
They're gonna kill us.
This time they mean it.

11
00:00:53,293 --> 00:00:56,603
Eli, tell the drivers
to make their final preparations.

12
00:00:57,573 --> 00:00:58,926
Then kill the women.

13
00:01:07,373 --> 00:01:10,445
I don't know where Jack is.
I haven't seen him since this morning.

14
00:01:10,533 --> 00:01:12,763
Since he escaped
from custody with a hostage?

15
00:01:12,853 --> 00:01:14,844
- Yes.
- I'm not sure I believe you.

16
00:01:15,213 --> 00:01:17,932
After Jamey,
we don't know who we can trust.

17
00:01:20,173 --> 00:01:21,811
Where's my wife?

18
00:01:21,933 --> 00:01:23,332
Agh!

19
00:01:23,413 --> 00:01:27,167
We are talking about my family.
Do you understand me?

20
00:01:27,653 --> 00:01:32,602
All I want is to get them back. As soon as
I know they are safe, I will let you go.

21
00:01:32,693 --> 00:01:34,684
That is the agreement.

22
00:02:00,973 --> 00:02:04,409
- Take the next exit.
- Placerita Canyon Road?

23
00:02:04,493 --> 00:02:07,212
- Yeah.
- How much further is this place?

24
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:11,172
I told you I'd take you to your family
and I will. That was the deal.

25
00:02:11,613 --> 00:02:16,767
The deal is you'd better hope my wife
and daughter are still alive. That's the deal.

26
00:02:24,653 --> 00:02:27,804
I'm sure my being here
has been a big adjustment.

27
00:02:27,893 --> 00:02:32,489
I appreciate the hard work
and long hours you're all putting in.

28
00:02:32,573 --> 00:02:35,485
There's a high probability
that Palmer is still in danger,

29
00:02:35,573 --> 00:02:38,167
but we are making progress on several fronts.

30
00:02:39,013 --> 00:02:42,926
Senator, if we could just
get one statement from you, sir...

31
00:02:43,013 --> 00:02:44,924
Yes, sir, please.

32
00:02:54,453 --> 00:02:57,604
Our most promising lead
continues to be Jack Bauer.

33
00:02:57,693 --> 00:03:02,369
Local and federal law enforcement
have made finding him a priority.

34
00:03:02,453 --> 00:03:07,322
We're trying to locate the man who posed as
a photographer at the senator's appearance.

35
00:03:07,413 --> 00:03:09,847
This man may have been
involved with Bauer.

36
00:03:09,933 --> 00:03:15,690
I've told the agencies we're working with they
can expect full cooperation... from all of us.

37
00:03:17,053 --> 00:03:21,444
Hopefully, we can repair some of the damage
caused by Bauer's recent actions.

38
00:03:22,213 --> 00:03:24,204
Thank you. That's all.

39
00:03:31,413 --> 00:03:33,324
- Bauer.
- Jack.

40
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:36,962
You were right. Kevin Carroll showed up
with the information we need.

41
00:03:37,053 --> 00:03:39,772
I'm on my way to where
Teri and Kim are being held.

42
00:03:39,853 --> 00:03:42,367
- Where?
- Somewhere in the north valley.

43
00:03:42,453 --> 00:03:46,890
East of the 5 between Tampa and Reseda.
I'm coming up to some orange groves now.

44
00:03:46,973 --> 00:03:50,045
Activate the GPS function
on the PalmPilot you sent me.

45
00:03:50,133 --> 00:03:53,170
I need satellite photos
so I can see what I'm going into.

46
00:03:53,253 --> 00:03:56,563
Make them high res so I can
identify structures and personnel.

47
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:59,645
OK. I'll need a few minutes
to download off the satellite.

48
00:03:59,733 --> 00:04:02,884
- It won't be a fresh image.
- Fine. Get me what you can. I'll wait.

49
00:04:02,973 --> 00:04:05,407
- Jack?
- What?

50
00:04:05,493 --> 00:04:08,769
Green. She's still squeezing
everyone here to bring you in.

51
00:04:10,253 --> 00:04:13,245
I will turn myself in
as soon as I know my family is safe.

52
00:04:14,213 --> 00:04:17,523
- She thinks I've been in contact with you.
- Deny it. I'll back you up.

53
00:04:17,613 --> 00:04:22,892
- I know you've put yourself on the line...
- No one's twisting my arm. I gotta go.

54
00:04:26,653 --> 00:04:28,644
Excuse me.

55
00:04:29,973 --> 00:04:31,122
- Was that Jack?
- Yeah.

56
00:04:31,213 --> 00:04:34,444
- Where is he?
- The north valley, closing in on Teri and Kim.

57
00:04:34,533 --> 00:04:38,048
- You gonna tell Green about this?
- Not until he gets them out.

58
00:04:38,133 --> 00:04:40,124
What if he can't?

59
00:04:41,093 --> 00:04:43,891
I'm gonna have to live with my mistake.

60
00:04:43,973 --> 00:04:47,090
Tony, I appreciate
you looking the other way on this,

61
00:04:47,173 --> 00:04:50,006
but don't feel you've gotta help me
cover for Jack any more.

62
00:04:50,093 --> 00:04:52,129
I'm not doing this for Jack.

63
00:05:23,293 --> 00:05:27,002
Kimberly. He tried to kill us.

64
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:30,563
I didn't have a choice.

65
00:05:30,653 --> 00:05:35,010
Taking a person's life, believe me,
I... I feel sick.

66
00:05:35,093 --> 00:05:38,324
That's just it, Mom. I don't feel bad at all. I...

67
00:05:38,413 --> 00:05:41,086
I don't feel anything except happy he's dead.

68
00:05:43,813 --> 00:05:45,804
They're looking for him.

69
00:06:00,813 --> 00:06:05,284
OK. We have to get outta here
before they find him. Cover up the blood.

70
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:17,450
Yeah, that's right, man.
No time for this.

71
00:06:20,253 --> 00:06:24,565
There's two of them.
When they're gone, we'll move.

72
00:06:55,013 --> 00:06:58,403
- Nina.
- I have the photos. They're a few hours old.

73
00:06:58,773 --> 00:07:00,764
Hold on.

74
00:07:03,693 --> 00:07:06,002
- OK. I'm ready to receive.
- Are you there yet?

75
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:08,607
I'm just outside the perimeter.

76
00:07:08,693 --> 00:07:12,527
I see a dozen people on the ground.
Some look like they're carrying weapons.

77
00:07:12,613 --> 00:07:16,049
- That looks right.
- There could be more inside the buildings.

78
00:07:16,133 --> 00:07:20,490
We should bring Green into this. Come
clean with her so she can authorise backup.

79
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:24,452
I don't want backup.
Not until I know my family is safe.

80
00:07:24,533 --> 00:07:27,252
You cannot go into
an armed camp by yourself. If...

81
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:30,962
Nina. My family's being
held hostage because of me.

82
00:07:31,053 --> 00:07:34,204
If you bring CTU in, they could screw up
and make this another Waco.

83
00:07:34,293 --> 00:07:36,284
Send me the photo. Now.

84
00:07:38,213 --> 00:07:40,204
- I'm sending.
- Thank you.

85
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:43,528
I'll get back to you.

86
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:02,322
Get outta the car.

87
00:08:02,413 --> 00:08:04,404
What are you doing, Jack?

88
00:08:05,853 --> 00:08:08,686
Dammit, Jack.
Will you get a hold of yourself?

89
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:12,848
We had an agreement.
I bring you here, you let me go.

90
00:08:13,813 --> 00:08:18,443
The agreement was as soon as
my family is safe, I will let you go.

91
00:08:18,533 --> 00:08:22,651
Jack, don't be stupid. Even if you get in there,
you'll never find them without me.

92
00:08:22,733 --> 00:08:24,724
Come on!

93
00:08:27,773 --> 00:08:29,809
Jack, please.

94
00:08:31,013 --> 00:08:33,322
All right. All right.

95
00:08:37,533 --> 00:08:38,852
You drive.

96
00:08:38,933 --> 00:08:42,926
Jack, if Gaines thinks for a moment
that I brought you here,

97
00:08:43,013 --> 00:08:45,447
he'll have no problem killing us both.

98
00:08:45,533 --> 00:08:47,524
Then we should avoid Gaines.

99
00:08:47,613 --> 00:08:49,922
Get in the car.

100
00:08:50,013 --> 00:08:52,811
OK. OK. Just relax.

101
00:09:17,013 --> 00:09:21,245
Real or not, the threat on your life will
probably give you a bounce in the polls.

102
00:09:27,093 --> 00:09:29,971
- What's wrong, David?
- I'm tired.

103
00:09:30,893 --> 00:09:32,884
There's something else.

104
00:09:32,973 --> 00:09:36,010
You've been off your game
since you spoke to Carl.

105
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:44,884
Carl's gonna stop the Kingsley story
coming out... by cutting off her source.

106
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:47,284
- Keith's therapist?
- Yeah.

107
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:53,453
- Did Carl say how he planned to do this?
- No. He just said I'd better stay out of it.

108
00:09:53,533 --> 00:09:56,001
Maybe that's good advice.

109
00:09:57,893 --> 00:10:01,932
Well, you don't seriously think Carl
would do something to hurt this guy?

110
00:10:02,013 --> 00:10:05,005
You know Carl better than I do. You tell me.

111
00:10:07,253 --> 00:10:09,323
I think you're being paranoid,

112
00:10:09,413 --> 00:10:14,885
but if you're really concerned
I'll call this therapist, tell him to be careful.

113
00:10:14,973 --> 00:10:17,965
I already tried. I got his voice mail both times.

114
00:10:18,053 --> 00:10:21,523
You called him? Exposing yourself like that?

115
00:10:25,213 --> 00:10:28,728
For God's sakes, David,
you're running for president.

116
00:10:29,213 --> 00:10:31,204
What were you thinking?!

117
00:10:43,093 --> 00:10:47,484
Anything goes wrong, everyone
around the car dies, starting with you.

118
00:10:54,973 --> 00:10:58,170
- Gaines has been waiting for you.
- I know.

119
00:10:58,253 --> 00:11:01,529
- What happened to you?
- I had a fight with your wife.

120
00:11:01,613 --> 00:11:05,049
Are you gonna open up the gate
or do I have to do it myself?

121
00:11:11,533 --> 00:11:13,967
Roll up the window and go.

122
00:11:49,613 --> 00:11:51,604
Stop here.

123
00:11:55,453 --> 00:11:59,526
- How many men on site?
- 15, 20.

124
00:11:59,933 --> 00:12:03,721
- Which is it? 15 or 20?
- I didn't do the hiring.

125
00:12:06,653 --> 00:12:09,725
My wife and daughter are in
one of these buildings. Which one?

126
00:12:09,813 --> 00:12:12,646
- I don't know.
- Take a guess.

127
00:12:15,613 --> 00:12:17,683
This whole rescue act...

128
00:12:17,773 --> 00:12:22,563
You really think it's gonna make up for
how you screwed up your marriage, Jack?

129
00:12:22,653 --> 00:12:24,803
Teri's told me everything.

130
00:12:25,413 --> 00:12:29,042
How you were never around,
the separation... I mean...

131
00:12:29,133 --> 00:12:31,363
You're wasting your time.

132
00:12:32,733 --> 00:12:34,769
Teri's been very lonely.

133
00:12:38,813 --> 00:12:42,886
For the last time, which building are they in?

134
00:12:47,373 --> 00:12:51,810
It's this one.
It used to be used for cold storage.

135
00:13:02,613 --> 00:13:04,604
Dammit.

136
00:13:13,653 --> 00:13:15,803
- Yeah.
- You understand my concern.

137
00:13:15,893 --> 00:13:19,363
- Yeah.
- You do realise what's at stake, don’t you?

138
00:13:19,453 --> 00:13:21,648
You know we're working against the clock?

139
00:13:21,733 --> 00:13:25,772
Don't worry, . Drazen.
Yeah, we'll be outta here within the hour.

140
00:13:25,853 --> 00:13:29,732
- If there's a problem, you'll be first to know.
- I want an update soon.

141
00:13:29,813 --> 00:13:31,451
Yeah.

142
00:13:31,533 --> 00:13:33,330
Hey, Rick.

143
00:13:34,093 --> 00:13:36,368
- Where's Eli?
- I haven't seen him.

144
00:13:36,453 --> 00:13:40,048
I sent him to take care of the women
a while ago. See what's taking so long.

145
00:13:40,133 --> 00:13:42,772
You want me to load this up first?

146
00:13:42,853 --> 00:13:45,048
Yeah.

147
00:15:09,613 --> 00:15:11,604
Dammit.

148
00:15:37,613 --> 00:15:40,081
- Hello.
- This is Dr Ferragamo.

149
00:15:40,173 --> 00:15:42,164
Thank you for returning my call.

150
00:15:42,253 --> 00:15:46,451
- Your message said it was urgent.
- Yes. I wanted to talk to you about my son.

151
00:15:47,173 --> 00:15:52,566
- I can't do that. Doctor-patient privilege.
- It didn't stop you from talking to the press.

152
00:15:52,653 --> 00:15:56,566
- If you're calling to threaten me...
- I am not the one who's threatening you.

153
00:15:56,653 --> 00:15:58,848
Really?

154
00:15:58,933 --> 00:16:03,961
Whatever you leaked to Kingsley, certain
people wanna stop you from confirming it.

155
00:16:04,053 --> 00:16:06,692
I assume you're referring to yourself?

156
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:09,203
No! I'm trying to protect you.

157
00:16:09,293 --> 00:16:13,332
You've covered up one murder, and now
you're threatening me if I don't keep quiet?

158
00:16:13,413 --> 00:16:16,610
- You're twisting my words.
- I think I'm hearing you clearly.

159
00:16:22,293 --> 00:16:26,844
You've reached the office of Dr. Ferragamo.
Please leave your name at the tone.

160
00:16:26,933 --> 00:16:30,892
Dr. Ferragamo, pick up the phone, please.
I need you to hear me out.

161
00:16:31,893 --> 00:16:33,770
Dr. Ferragamo.

162
00:16:38,133 --> 00:16:40,601
Doesn't sound like it went very well.

163
00:16:40,693 --> 00:16:42,968
I need to see him. Talk to him face to face.

164
00:16:43,053 --> 00:16:44,532
- Later.
- Now.

165
00:16:44,613 --> 00:16:47,650
You're supposed to be delivering
your policy statement

166
00:16:47,733 --> 00:16:50,372
on public health care in one hour.

167
00:16:50,453 --> 00:16:53,251
- I'll be late.
- What are you going to do?

168
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:55,927
Pull up to his office with your motorcade?

169
00:16:57,933 --> 00:17:00,242
I'll ride with Secret Service.

170
00:17:02,573 --> 00:17:04,962
You're getting in way over your head.

171
00:17:06,573 --> 00:17:08,450
Pull over.

172
00:17:18,413 --> 00:17:20,404
They're gone. Let's go.

173
00:17:24,533 --> 00:17:26,524
Are you ready?

174
00:17:28,613 --> 00:17:31,207
- Kimberly...
- Mom, don't say anything. I know.

175
00:17:33,973 --> 00:17:35,372
I love you too.

176
00:17:59,373 --> 00:18:03,286
Sh. Teri, it's me. It's Jack. Sh.

177
00:18:05,733 --> 00:18:07,724
It's me, baby.

178
00:18:12,813 --> 00:18:14,371
- You OK?
- Yeah.

179
00:18:14,453 --> 00:18:16,569
- Where's Kim?
- She's here.

180
00:18:16,653 --> 00:18:19,884
- Kim? Sweetheart, come here.
- Daddy! Oh!

181
00:18:21,773 --> 00:18:24,685
- It's gonna be OK.
- I knew you'd come.

182
00:18:25,613 --> 00:18:28,207
It's all right, baby. It's all right.

183
00:18:32,053 --> 00:18:35,011
- Can we leave now?
- Baby, we're gonna get outta here soon.

184
00:18:35,093 --> 00:18:37,084
OK? Just one minute.

185
00:19:04,413 --> 00:19:06,404
Making any progress?

186
00:19:07,653 --> 00:19:12,568
- We're working on the threat assessment.
- I think you both know where Jack is.

187
00:19:12,653 --> 00:19:16,362
You're interfering with a criminal
investigation, harbouring a fugitive...

188
00:19:16,453 --> 00:19:18,364
Jack is not a threat to Palmer.

189
00:19:18,453 --> 00:19:21,923
How do you know if you haven't talked
to him? And why is he still missing?

190
00:19:22,013 --> 00:19:26,211
- Polygraph us if you think we're lying.
- So you can stall some more?

191
00:19:29,213 --> 00:19:33,126
Save us all a lot of time and trouble
and just tell me where he is.

192
00:19:37,373 --> 00:19:39,682
Tony, go to holding room two.
I'll be there soon.

193
00:19:39,773 --> 00:19:42,890
- Nina, go to one.
- What are you doin'?

194
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:44,964
- I'm suspending you both.
- What?

195
00:19:45,053 --> 00:19:49,285
- Until one of you tells me where Jack is.
- You don't have the authority to do that.

196
00:19:49,373 --> 00:19:52,285
The first one to tell me
will have a career and a future here.

197
00:19:52,373 --> 00:19:55,490
The other one will be
prosecuted and discharged.

198
00:20:16,773 --> 00:20:19,765
Rick! I thought I told you to go check on Eli.

199
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:22,324
Yes, sir!

200
00:20:33,013 --> 00:20:36,130
- Who is he?
- They sent him to kill us.

201
00:20:36,213 --> 00:20:38,727
- When?
- About a half-hour ago.

202
00:20:40,093 --> 00:20:43,130
That means someone's
gonna come looking for him.

203
00:20:46,853 --> 00:20:50,732
- Hey, sweetheart, come here. Come on.
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

204
00:20:50,813 --> 00:20:52,849
Kim, it's me!

205
00:20:52,933 --> 00:20:55,527
- It's OK. He gave us the gun.
- Get away from the door.

206
00:20:55,613 --> 00:20:57,683
- Dad!
- Go back to your mother.

207
00:20:57,773 --> 00:20:59,764
Kim? Kim?

208
00:21:01,053 --> 00:21:03,169
Dad, stop it. No!

209
00:21:03,973 --> 00:21:06,567
Jack. Jack! You're killing him.

210
00:21:06,653 --> 00:21:09,486
He wants to get outta here
just as much as we do.

211
00:21:09,573 --> 00:21:11,848
It's true. Jack! Please!

212
00:21:15,933 --> 00:21:17,969
Why are you helping them?

213
00:21:18,053 --> 00:21:21,568
Cos I got Kim into this. But I didn't know
how heavy it was gonna get.

214
00:21:21,653 --> 00:21:23,644
Get away from him.

215
00:21:23,733 --> 00:21:25,883
Get up.

216
00:21:29,813 --> 00:21:32,247
- Is anyone else coming?
- Not that I know of.

217
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:35,131
Good. Go sit with your partner.

218
00:21:37,373 --> 00:21:39,364
I'm glad you're OK.

219
00:21:50,693 --> 00:21:52,968
We both know why Nina's covering for Jack.

220
00:21:53,053 --> 00:21:57,843
But I think the only reason
you're covering for him is to cover for Nina.

221
00:21:57,933 --> 00:22:01,687
From where I'm sitting, Tony,
it looks like she's using you.

222
00:22:01,773 --> 00:22:06,289
- You don't know what you're talking about.
- I want to help you see the situation clearly.

223
00:22:06,373 --> 00:22:10,366
Somehow, Jack Bauer is connected
to the threat against Palmer.

224
00:22:11,133 --> 00:22:14,205
By not telling me where he is,
you're endangering the life of a senator

225
00:22:14,293 --> 00:22:18,366
who stands a damn good chance
of becoming the next president.

226
00:22:40,973 --> 00:22:44,363
What's Jack doing, Tony?
Why did he show up at the Palmer breakfast

227
00:22:44,453 --> 00:22:49,163
- and grab the gun of a Secret Service agent?
- He claims he was creating a diversion.

228
00:22:49,253 --> 00:22:52,643
Yeah, I know what Jack said.
I wanna know what you think.

229
00:22:53,613 --> 00:22:57,401
- Look... if I knew where Jack was...
- You do know.

230
00:22:57,493 --> 00:22:59,449
- You're wrong.
- No, I'm not.

231
00:23:04,333 --> 00:23:08,042
Help me here, Tony, or getting fired's
gonna be the least of your problems.

232
00:23:08,133 --> 00:23:11,887
I will make sure you're prosecuted.
You will go to prison.

233
00:23:15,293 --> 00:23:17,887
I'll give you ten minutes.

234
00:23:17,973 --> 00:23:22,763
Take the time to decide if it's really
worth ruining your life over this.

235
00:23:38,973 --> 00:23:41,328
The car is on the north end of the compound.

236
00:23:41,413 --> 00:23:45,042
I just need to go get it and I'm gonna
pick you both up right there. OK?

237
00:23:45,133 --> 00:23:49,649
- You're not leaving us.
- Sweetheart, I'm not. I'll be right back.

238
00:23:49,733 --> 00:23:53,089
Every bad thing that has happened
has been because we weren't together.

239
00:23:53,173 --> 00:23:55,243
We're not separating again, Jack.

240
00:23:55,973 --> 00:24:00,649
Maybe you don't have to.
There's another way out. A better way, I think.

241
00:24:04,933 --> 00:24:07,322
- How?
- Gaines still thinks I'm on his side.

242
00:24:07,413 --> 00:24:10,530
So I can get one of the vans
without them noticing.

243
00:24:10,613 --> 00:24:15,482
Even if they stop me, your car'll still
be there. And you can all be together.

244
00:24:18,653 --> 00:24:21,326
He's right, Jack.

245
00:24:23,373 --> 00:24:26,729
- You trust him?
- I do.

246
00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:29,324
Rick, it's Gaines.

247
00:24:30,533 --> 00:24:33,127
Rick, what's going on down there?

248
00:24:34,133 --> 00:24:36,931
- Answer it.
- Mr. Gaines.

249
00:24:37,013 --> 00:24:41,643
- Where's Eli?
- He's outside digging a hole to bury the girls.

250
00:24:41,733 --> 00:24:45,328
Get him, dammit.
I need him back here right now.

251
00:24:46,373 --> 00:24:50,924
When Eli doesn't come back, Gaines is
comin' down here. Let me get the van.

252
00:24:55,373 --> 00:24:57,364
You've got five minutes.

253
00:26:10,493 --> 00:26:14,452
Stack those on the side, you know.
They don't have to be upright.

254
00:26:14,533 --> 00:26:17,684
- Can I bring it out on the other side?
- If it'll fit.

255
00:26:24,893 --> 00:26:28,602
We ain't got no time for lunch.
We gotta take care of this right now.

256
00:26:31,053 --> 00:26:34,284
Then handle it.
There's been a change of plan.

257
00:26:34,373 --> 00:26:36,887
No, I need to know now. Not later - now.

258
00:26:38,533 --> 00:26:40,922
What's so hard to understand about that?

259
00:26:43,533 --> 00:26:45,364
Come on, guys. Let's go.

260
00:26:47,733 --> 00:26:51,931
- Will you guys hurry with the truck there?
- I'll take it, Mr. Gaines.

261
00:26:59,253 --> 00:27:01,847
Hey, Joe, where's Eli?

262
00:27:08,493 --> 00:27:10,370
Get him, OK?

263
00:27:28,293 --> 00:27:30,090
- What are you doing?
- Taking the van.

264
00:27:30,173 --> 00:27:32,733
I can see that, Rick.
Where are you taking the van?

265
00:27:32,813 --> 00:27:35,247
To help Eli get the bodies
from the guesthouse.

266
00:27:35,333 --> 00:27:37,722
You can't move
a couple of women by yourselves?

267
00:27:37,813 --> 00:27:43,046
He told me to get the van, so I'm getting
the van. But if it's a problem, I don't have to.

268
00:27:43,133 --> 00:27:45,124
Mr. Gaines.

269
00:27:46,413 --> 00:27:49,211
- What?
- I was out on patrol and I found Kevin.

270
00:27:50,293 --> 00:27:52,523
What? Is he alive?

271
00:27:52,613 --> 00:27:56,322
Yeah, but he's out cold.
Someone messed him up pretty good.

272
00:27:56,413 --> 00:27:59,962
- Where are you?
- I'm in the north grove, near the generator.

273
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:01,452
I'll be right there.

274
00:28:01,533 --> 00:28:03,524
You're driving. Let's go.

275
00:28:07,813 --> 00:28:09,804
Open the damn door.

276
00:28:31,013 --> 00:28:34,323
At the very least
be careful what you say to Ferragamo.

277
00:28:35,173 --> 00:28:40,486
- I'll be careful.
- I mean, it's not like he's so squeaky clean.

278
00:28:40,573 --> 00:28:44,248
By talking about Keith to the press
he violated every professional ethic.

279
00:28:44,333 --> 00:28:46,893
I know what he did, Mike.

280
00:28:57,893 --> 00:28:59,565
Pull over here.

281
00:29:00,933 --> 00:29:03,049
Here's the office.

282
00:29:08,293 --> 00:29:12,684
No, no, no. Let me find out
what happened. I'll be right back.

283
00:29:23,573 --> 00:29:26,371
What happened? What caused this?

284
00:29:26,453 --> 00:29:28,444
A possible gas explosion.

285
00:29:42,053 --> 00:29:45,090
- It's Ferragamo, isn't it?
- There was a fire.

286
00:29:45,173 --> 00:29:47,892
They say it might have been
a broken gas line.

287
00:29:47,973 --> 00:29:51,090
- He didn't get out in time.
- Dammit!

288
00:29:51,173 --> 00:29:55,212
They torched his office.
And you can bet his records were destroyed.

289
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:57,329
We don't know anything yet.

290
00:29:57,413 --> 00:30:02,533
- It could have been an accident, David.
- But it wasn't. It was murder.

291
00:30:02,613 --> 00:30:06,367
- David, stop. No, wait, wait. Listen.
- Get out of my way.

292
00:30:07,253 --> 00:30:12,964
Hear me out here. Just hear me out here.
Look, David, think this through.

293
00:30:13,613 --> 00:30:18,129
Even if you're right, this is
the absolute wrong way to play it.

294
00:30:28,653 --> 00:30:30,644
Dammit!

295
00:30:38,093 --> 00:30:40,129
Go.

296
00:30:53,253 --> 00:30:55,642
Time's up, Tony.

297
00:30:55,733 --> 00:30:58,122
Have you thought about what I said?

298
00:30:59,293 --> 00:31:01,648
- I have.
- And?

299
00:31:10,133 --> 00:31:13,603
- Excuse me. You have a call.
- I said no interruptions.

300
00:31:13,693 --> 00:31:15,684
It's Bauer.

301
00:31:20,053 --> 00:31:21,327
Where the hell are you?

302
00:31:21,413 --> 00:31:24,803
You might have my office,
but if you wanna do my job, listen to me.

303
00:31:24,893 --> 00:31:28,363
- I don't take orders from you.
- I found the people behind the Palmer hit.

304
00:31:28,453 --> 00:31:31,126
You're one of 'em
unless you can prove otherwise.

305
00:31:31,213 --> 00:31:34,728
They had kidnapped my family - my wife
and daughter. But I'm with them now.

306
00:31:34,813 --> 00:31:37,646
It's why I worked underground
and couldn't contact CTU.

307
00:31:37,733 --> 00:31:41,931
- You haven't spoken to anyone here?
- I couldn't risk it. Believe me, I wish I could.

308
00:31:42,013 --> 00:31:44,891
It's not my job to believe you, Jack.
It's my job to find you.

309
00:31:44,973 --> 00:31:49,012
I'm at an orange grove three miles
north of the split on the 5. Hold on.

310
00:31:50,053 --> 00:31:54,649
34 degrees, 17 minutes north,
118 degrees 28 minutes west. You got that?

311
00:31:54,733 --> 00:31:57,406
- Yeah.
- I've identified 11 hostiles.

312
00:31:57,493 --> 00:32:01,042
They're going west on the compound
service road. Bring in air support.

313
00:32:01,133 --> 00:32:02,885
I'll get back in touch.

314
00:32:08,413 --> 00:32:13,692
Get Central Dispatch. And find out where
Jack's family has been for the last six hours.

315
00:32:14,893 --> 00:32:16,884
Dammit.

316
00:32:36,173 --> 00:32:38,812
- Are you ready to go home?
- Definitely.

317
00:32:42,373 --> 00:32:45,843
- We get to finish our chess game.
- I'm two moves from checkmating you.

318
00:32:45,933 --> 00:32:48,811
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. We'll see.

319
00:32:56,573 --> 00:32:59,371
Hey. We're gonna be all right.

320
00:33:00,573 --> 00:33:02,723
I promise.

321
00:33:06,013 --> 00:33:09,767
- Let me know as soon as you see him.
- Yeah. OK.

322
00:33:16,173 --> 00:33:18,812
Teri, it's gonna be OK.

323
00:33:20,893 --> 00:33:23,361
Between us. You and me.

324
00:33:26,453 --> 00:33:31,208
I love you. And I promise you everything's
gonna be different from now on.

325
00:33:52,933 --> 00:33:56,687
No, I want two choppers. If Villa has
a problem with that, he can call me.

326
00:34:00,373 --> 00:34:04,525
Jack called with his location.
I sent three field units to back him up.

327
00:34:04,613 --> 00:34:07,730
- Is he all right?
- We'll find out soon enough.

328
00:34:08,733 --> 00:34:13,329
- So which one of us are you gonna suspend?
- Neither of you.

329
00:34:13,413 --> 00:34:18,612
Only because I don't have enough actionable
evidence that you withheld information.

330
00:34:20,813 --> 00:34:22,883
But I plan to keep looking.

331
00:34:28,493 --> 00:34:33,886
I wanna know who's running point in the field
units so we can monitor what's happening.

332
00:34:39,133 --> 00:34:42,409
- Are you OK?
- Alberta worked me pretty hard in there.

333
00:34:44,493 --> 00:34:46,643
Yeah, I know.

334
00:34:47,813 --> 00:34:51,726
I gotta tell you,
if Jake hadn't have called when he did...

335
00:34:52,973 --> 00:34:56,409
You took a lot of chances for me.
I won't forget it.

336
00:35:12,333 --> 00:35:14,847
Kevin. Kevin!

337
00:35:15,973 --> 00:35:18,362
Kevin, what the hell happened?

338
00:35:20,413 --> 00:35:23,644
- Bauer. He's here.
- What?

339
00:35:27,853 --> 00:35:32,085
I went to meet Cofell,
but Bauer had already gotten to him.

340
00:35:32,173 --> 00:35:34,926
- How long have you been here?
- I don't know.

341
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:44,043
Rick!

342
00:35:47,133 --> 00:35:49,886
Bauer's here.
Those near the guesthouse, go in strong.

343
00:35:49,973 --> 00:35:52,328
Seal the gates. Make sure no one gets out.

344
00:35:59,093 --> 00:36:01,368
Stay in the door.

345
00:36:24,973 --> 00:36:27,328
It's him. He brought the van. Come on.

346
00:36:34,653 --> 00:36:37,406
- In you go. Go on.
- Gaines is coming.

347
00:36:37,493 --> 00:36:40,610
- He found the guy you came in with.
- I'll drive.

348
00:37:51,213 --> 00:37:53,283
Hold on!

349
00:38:08,013 --> 00:38:09,765
Get down! Get down!

350
00:38:15,013 --> 00:38:16,605
Hold on!

351
00:38:26,493 --> 00:38:28,688
Stay down!

352
00:38:34,013 --> 00:38:37,085
- Get up to the van.
- Everybody out and stay low!

353
00:38:40,293 --> 00:38:43,444
Get to the back of the van.
Use the wheels for cover.

354
00:38:48,773 --> 00:38:50,650
Take cover.

355
00:38:57,413 --> 00:38:59,847
- Cover me. I'm going across.
- Move! Move!

356
00:39:01,853 --> 00:39:05,641
On the satellite photos you'll see
an old water tower by the service road.

357
00:39:05,733 --> 00:39:10,523
Go straight through these woods, follow
the creek bed and run. I'll see CTU finds you.

358
00:39:17,653 --> 00:39:21,202
- What about you, Jack?
- I'll be right behind you.

359
00:39:22,253 --> 00:39:24,642
- There's too many of them.
- Not if I help.

360
00:39:25,373 --> 00:39:27,728
- You know how to use that thing?
- Yeah.

361
00:39:27,813 --> 00:39:29,246
Teri, stay there!

362
00:39:35,173 --> 00:39:36,731
Wait for a clear shot!

363
00:39:36,813 --> 00:39:41,250
- I'm not leaving you, Jack.
- You won't be. You'll be taking care of Kim.

364
00:39:41,333 --> 00:39:44,689
- But Dad...
- Don't argue with me. Both of you, go now.

365
00:39:47,573 --> 00:39:49,564
Go! Run!

366
00:40:04,013 --> 00:40:05,844
Keep covering me!

367
00:40:22,373 --> 00:40:24,364
Go to the tree line.

368
00:40:28,173 --> 00:40:30,164
Go. Go.

369
00:40:36,213 --> 00:40:37,328
Stay down.

370
00:40:44,293 --> 00:40:46,602
Hit the deck!

371
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:52,609
Come on. Get up.

372
00:40:53,493 --> 00:40:55,484
Move!

373
00:41:01,493 --> 00:41:03,484
Let's go.

374
00:41:12,213 --> 00:41:13,771
Keep moving.

375
00:41:23,693 --> 00:41:26,207
I can stop it bleeding
when we're through the trees.

376
00:41:26,293 --> 00:41:28,727
Come on. I'm not leaving you behind.
