00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:15,039
Let me speak to Audrey.

2
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,715
Her wellbeing is entirely up to you,
Mr Bauer.

3
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,429
What we want is the component
from the triggering mechanism.

4
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,511
<i>The FB-sub-circuit board.</i>

5
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,672
You give me the component,
I give you Audrey.

6
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,513
- Stand down, Jack!
- I can't.

7
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:36,479
- I won't say it again. Drop it!
- Agent Doyle, I am following orders...

8
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,755
Take him out!

9
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:44,758
It's my understanding, Jack, that component
holds the key to Russian defence codes.

10
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:48,116
The Chinese need to believe
I will go through with this exchange.

11
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,351
I will destroy that circuit board
with a concealed charge of C4.

12
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,954
- You'll sacrifice yourself?
- If I have to.

13
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:57,828
You're asking me
to sign off on a suicide mission.

14
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,754
Mr President... you owe me.

15
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:05,396
<i>(Jack) I want you to help me
retrieve one of those circuit boards.</i>

16
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,708
<i>(Chloe) I'm sending it.</i>

17
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,758
The Russians have kept that
out of Chinese hands for years.

18
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,149
- I did it for Jack.
- What will the Russians say

19
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,958
when they find we gave it to them?

20
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,998
- It's not gonna get that far.
- You have to tell Buchanan.

21
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,196
Chloe, I want you to stand down on this.

22
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,510
You've shown me I can't trust you.

23
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,830
First, I wanna say
that I am grateful to report

24
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,275
that all nuclear devices
have been recovered.

25
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:29,272
Based on the intelligence,
I can say with full confidence

26
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,157
that... that... that we will...

27
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,071
<i>(gasps)</i>

28
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,476
<i>(woman) Call Medical right away.</i>

29
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:40,750
Notify the Senate. Have the SecDef
and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs

30
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,559
authorise me under the 25th Amendment.

31
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,232
Wayne Palmer issued a finding

32
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:49,313
allowing Jack Bauer to hand
Russian technology over to the Chinese

33
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,358
in exchange
for the return of a covertly held hostage.

34
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:57,150
Bauer has guaranteed that the technology
will not fall into the hands of the Chinese.

35
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,277
Even Jack Bauer
can't guarantee that outcome.

36
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,430
Tell CTU to stop Bauer.

37
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,360
CTU has the signal.
They're monitoring the device.

38
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,873
We're set. Let's go.

39
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,678
<i>(phone rings)</i>

40
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,159
Doyle.

41
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,276
Noah Daniels is acting president.

42
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,591
He wants the operation shut down
and Jack brought back to CTU.

43
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,669
Understood.

44
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,908
- Don't you move.
- Jack...

45
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,833
Slowly, I want you to pull over.

46
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,955
Now.

47
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,830
This is gonna end badly, Jack.
You can't go against the White House!

48
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,360
Wait! Wait! Stop! Stop!

49
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,871
<i>- Stop! Stop!

<i>- Wait, wait, stop the car! Stop!

51
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,598
Stop!

52

<i>(man) What the hell?! Are you crazy?</i>

54
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:02,279
- I'm a federal agent. I need the vehicle.
- Where's your badge?

55
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,118
<i>- (phone rings)
- Pressman.</i>

56
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,839
<i>Milo, it's Doyle.
I need to speak with Buchanan.</i>

57
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,708
Hold on. Sir, Doyle's on line one.

58
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,871
Mike, do you have Jack in custody?

59
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,997
No. He got the drop on me
before I could get the component.

60
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,514
- Where are you?
- In a vehicle in pursuit.

61
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,478
- Morris, do you have Jack's position?
- Yeah.

62
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,710
- Heading north on the 180.
- Copy that.

63
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:46,715
- Mike, Jack's gonna disengage that tracker.
- I'll get him before he does.

64
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,792
All right, listen up.
Jack Bauer's gone rogue.

65
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:53,873
He has in his possession the FB-sub-circuit
board. Mike Doyle is in pursuit.

66
00:03:53,960 --> 00:04:00,354
He needs all available resources to stop Jack
before he gives it to the Chinese.

67
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,919
Chloe.

68
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,070
- I need you on task.
- You said...

69
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,957
I know what I said.

70
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,918
I need my best people looking for Jack.

71
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,958
Can I trust you to help me do that?

72
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,190
- Yes, sir.
- Good. Thank you.

73
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,678
That's bloody marvellous.
I just lost Jack's signal.

74
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:33,038
- How'd you do that?
- I didn't do anything. Itjust disappeared.

75
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:06,593
- There must be something in the transit path.
- You don't have to state the obvious, Chloe.

76
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,716
This doesn't have to be personal.

77
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,952
It's not personal. This road runs along
the main voltage feed for the valley.

78
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:17,636
Jack is using the power lines as a shield
while he separates the tracker from the board.

79
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,314
Can you keep an eye on things? Can you?

80
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,278
I have to explain this to Buchanan.

81
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,909
Hey, I thought you got sidelined.

82
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,232
Buchanan wants me to help find Jack.
Now he's dumped the tracker.

83
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,834
- Did you pull up Caltrans?
- Yeah.

84
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,992
I can't believe Jack would give
the board to the Chinese.

85
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,640
Jack would die before
he gives up that component.

86
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,510
I agree with you. The question is,
would Jack give up Audrey's life?

87
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,669
Exactly.

88
00:05:54,760 --> 00:06:00,118
Look, uh, I'll check the satellites, see if
they've restored any coverage in that area.

89
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:03,988
If you find anything,
send it to me, Doyle and LAPD.

90
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,231
- How much farther?
- We lost Jack eight miles north of you.

91
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:10,790
He used the power lines as a shield
while he removed the tracker.

92
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,395
- See if you can pick up a trail.
- I'll call you back when I get closer.

93
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,596
- Thank you, Morris.
- All right.

94
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22,036
I have a brief statement and I will not
be taking any questions at this time.

95
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:26,511
The president is en route to Bethesda
Naval Hospital and will arrive shortly.

96
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:31,674
The doctors have no idea whether or not
President Palmer will come out of this coma.

97
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:37,676
Vice President Daniels will be addressing
the country at 9am Eastern time. Thank you.

98
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,191
That's all, everyone.

99
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,233
- Tom.
- Yes, sir.

100
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:49,632
- Stick around. I wanna talk to you.
- All right, sir.

101
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,191
We need to clear the air, you and I.

102
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:02,116
You still have evidence that could hurt me,
and I'd like to know what your intentions are.

103
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,590
Truthfully, sir,
I haven't given it much thought.

104
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,274
Why don't you think about it now?

105
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,832
All right, sir.

106
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:14,993
It concerns me that you engaged
in conspiracy and perjury

107
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,150
to achieve political ends.

108
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:22,314
I don't think that's behaviour befitting
the acting President of the United States.

109
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,799
Tom,

110
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:27,429
the world has changed
in the last half-hour.

111
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,274
Right now this country
above all needs stability.

112
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,275
If I'm brought up on charges, then
America's left without elected leadership.

113
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:42,151
Sir, I made that tape both to back you off
your challenge to President Palmer,

114
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,754
but also to protect me.

115
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:48,515
Now, that was and remains my only reason.

116
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:54,709
- What about forcing my resignation?
- That was Wayne Palmer's idea, not mine.

117
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,791
So...

118
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,998
you're OK, then, with me in this chair?

119
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,956
Sir, it's no secret that policywise
you and I are in alignment.

120
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,918
I just simply hate how we got here.

121
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,318
Now that we are here...

122
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,872
Yes, sir. You have my support.

123
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,240
<i>(Daniels exhales)</i>

124
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:27,748
In the event that we ever get out of alignment,

125
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,719
I can't have you holding
this evidence over my head.

126
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,509
That's understood, sir. You have my word.

127
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,909
All right, Tom.

128
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,195
Glad to have you with me.

129
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:45,758
Now, what do you suggest we do with
Karen Hayes? Will she slow us down?

130
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:51,354
Well, of course she might, but she is smart.
She brings balance.

131
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,831
Fine, then she stays.

132
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:57,514
- May I let her know, sir?
- Sure.

133
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,471
Tom.

134
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,709
- Thank you.

Good. Go east on the 118...

No. From this point forward
we do this my way.

139
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,037
Don't test me, Mr Bauer.

140
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:28,238
Yes, I want the component,
but Audrey Raines' life means nothing to me.

141
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,710
Listen. CTU is looking for me.
They want to stop the exchange.

142
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:36,271
I know their satellite coverage.
I need to pick the location.

143
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,874
All right. Where?

144
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,870
There's an abandoned motel
called the Calderone off highway 305.

145
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:48,114
Come through the front door alone.
We'll make the exchange there.

146
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,272
We both have a chance to get
what we want here, Mr Bauer.

<i>(speaks Chinese)</i>

has deployed all its resources to find Bauer.

151
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:34,998
I don't wanna hear about their assurances,
Karen. They let Bauer steal the component.

00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:40,154
Well, if I may, sir, I could authorise
ancillary agencies to join the search.

153
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,879
That would increase
our chances of finding Bauer.

154
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,951
Do it.

155
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,669
Is there anything else you need from me?

156
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,594
Is there anything else I need from you?
Let me think.

157
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:09,953
I have the fate of the West,
the lives of millions hanging in the balance

158
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:14,670
and I can't stop thinking about you.

159
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:20,998
I'm not sure this is appropriate behaviour,
Mr Acting President.

160
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,913
Well, there's the phone. Call the media.

161
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,118
Tell them the acting president's
a dirty old man.

162
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,191
They already know.

163
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,429
I would like for you to...

164
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,710
spend what's left of the night.

165
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:00,035
I'll go home and pick up a change of clothes.

166
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,111
Good.

167
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:24,789
- I'm at the Tampa exit by the power lines.
- You match the last coordinates Morris had.

168
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:29,078
The White House is telling me if the Chinese
get a hold of this sub-circuit board

169
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,230
we'll have an international incident.

170
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:35,279
- I know the stakes, Bill.
- Have you figured out where Jack's headed?

171
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,828
I'm working on it now.

172
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:49,075
It looks like he headed east. What's up ahead?

173
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:53,551
- Two steep routes, the 305 and the 98.
- Do you have satellite on both?

174
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:58,589
No. The radiation made the area hard to cover.
The 98 has Caltrans cameras. I'll check them.

175
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,956
No, don't bother. Jack would know
about those. He's on the 305.

176
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:05,953
Check the cell towers. See if you can pick up
a call between Jack and Cheng.

177
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:10,909
I think I saw Jack pick up one of
the terrorists' phones at the warehouse.

178
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:16,118
Chloe's got that grid on her system.

179
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,636
- Who was that?
- Doyle. He thinks Jack's on the 305.

180
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,711
- How did he know?
- He figured it out.

181
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:26,920
Pull the logs on grid 19-12. Get everything
off that cell tower from the last 15 minutes.

182
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,879
- What am I looking for?
- Jack's using one of the terrorist's phones.

183
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:34,669
- Check all outgoing calls.
- We'll get it.

184
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,796
Oh. Um...

185
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,589
- What is this?
- Decryption schemes from the cell towers.

186
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:44,832
We're looking for a conversation
between Jack and Cheng.

187
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:49,277
- Why didn't you speak to me first?
- I don't know. That's just the way I did it.

188
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,590
We're being a little hostile, aren't we?

189
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,717
Fine. But I didn'tjust get there.
You pushed me halfway.

190
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,631
You're right. It's all my fault.

191
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:01,874
I didn't say it's all your fault. I said halfway.
50%. 0.5. See, you don't listen to me.

192
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:06,750
- That's why I just sent it to your screen.
- Hey, guys. What's going on?

193
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:11,595
My ex-wife is suddenly showing signs
of irrational behaviour.

194
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,669
OK.

195
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:15,991
- Do you know how to defrag Huffman keys?
- Yeah. Why?

196
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,991
- Could you help me out?
- Yeah.

197
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:21,197
Great. I'll just send the files to your system.

198
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:27,475
That's a really good idea.
You should work with Milo, get cosy.

199
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:30,393
Would you please stop acting like this?
I hate it.

200
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,029
Why don't you write down the way
you want me to act, put it in a file,

201
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:38,272
tab-delimited the way Milo loves it,
and shove it?

202
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:42,239
OK. The first item on the list would be,
"Don't be such ajealous jerk".

203
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,869
The day I'm jealous is the day I kill myself.
Is there anything else?

204
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:50,431
How about, "Don't arm
nuclear bombs for terrorists"?

205
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,474
Sorry. I didn't mean that.

206
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,354
That's not how I feel.

207
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:05,035
Yeah, it is.

208
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,795
No, it's not. Itjust slipped out of my mouth.

209
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,108
Morris!

210
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:18,438
I'll call the FBI,
get them to share resources with Bill.

211
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,317
<i>- Good. I'll...
- (phone rings)</i>

212
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,233
Excuse me. Yeah.

213
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,231
OK.

214
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,232
Well, tell him I'll be right there.

215
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,195
That's strange. Peter Hock is in my office
and he wants to talk to me.

216
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:36,511
- Department of Justice? What is that about?
- I have no idea.

217
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:41,310
- Be careful. He's got a lot of clout on the Hill.
- I know. I'll call you.

218
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,991
Peter.

219
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,275
<i>- Early enough for you?
- (laughs)</i>

220
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,999
So, what's going on? It sounded urgent.

221
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:57,675
You know I've been interrogating
Reed Pollock after his arrest.

222
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:01,036
<i>- That must be pleasant.
- (laughs)</i>

223
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,910
Pollock's looking at a death sentence for his
part in the assassination attempt on Palmer.

224
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,152
He's offering up everything he knows
hoping we'll show some leniency.

225
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,631
- And what does that have to do with me?
- Notjust you. This involves your husband.

226
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,711
Take a look.

227
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:26,470
<i>Listen to me, Peter. You and I both know
that there are going to be endless hearings</i>

228
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:31,634
<i>- looking into how Fayed acquired the nukes.
- (Peter) And you know something about that?</i>

229
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:35,872
<i>I can give you information that will keep blame
away from this administration.</i>

230
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:39,509
<i>- (Peter) I'm listening.
- I'm not saying anything until I have a deal.</i>

231
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,637
<i>- He's such a weasel.
- (Reed) In writing.</i>

232
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,396
We danced around for 20 minutes,
then he said this.

233
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:51,557
<i>(Reed) I'm telling you exactly what happened.</i>

234
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:55,519
<i>Bill Buchanan had Fayed in custody</i>

235
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,797
<i>- and he let him go.
- (Peter) And where's the proof?</i>

236
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,873
<i>(Reed) Karen Hayes put it in a blue file
over at Homeland.</i>

237
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:06,475
<i>That's a cover-up. And if you don't believe me,</i>

238
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:11,953
<i>I have recorded conversations
with Peter lanoni, Kurt Hewig and Myra Mark</i>

239
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:18,559
<i>and they will all testify that she sequestered
the file to protect her husband.</i>

240
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,070
Do me a favour, Karen.

241
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,515
Save me some time.

242
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,956
- Is it true or not?
- The facts are true.

243
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,996
But there's no cover-up here, Peter.

244
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:36,359
About two years ago we apprehended Fayed
as part of an FBl-CTU border sweep.

245
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:39,113
There wasn't enough to hold him.
He was one of many.

246
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,510
- He was maybe a mid-level player.
- That turned out to be wrong.

247
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:46,718
Fayed wasn't part of a cell or funded.
This all happened after he was released.

248
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:51,316
- So why was it blue-coded?
- Every year thousands are arrested.

249
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:55,996
If there isn't enough evidence they're released
and blue-coded. Standard procedure.

250
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,799
The only way to guarantee
no one becomes a threat

251
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,394
is to deprive everyone of their freedom.

252
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:07,316
All right. If this was a no-fault, why did this
carry so much weight with you 12 hours ago?

253
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:12,235
- Why resign rather than have this come out?
- Come on, Peter. We were under attack.

254
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:16,074
I wasn't gonna let this information
touch the president or my husband.

255
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:21,598
- They needed to lead us through this crisis.
- Well, here we are, 12 hours later.

256
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:27,915
Palmer's in a coma, the country's in shock
after losing over 13,000 innocent lives

257
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,437
and all people are going to be asking
is who let this happen?

258
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,318
Well, certainly not my husband.

259
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,760
He has devoted his life to this country.

260
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:42,435
This isn't my call, Karen,
but I think you know how this works.

261
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:48,390
Someone's going to have to go down,
and the farther from the president, the better.

262
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,914
So what exactly are you saying?

263
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,478
It's going to be either you or Bill.

264
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:59,678
Bill would be my preference.
He's lower in the food chain.

265
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,876
But you'll do.

266
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,557
<i>- (phone rings)
- Doyle.</i>

267
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:45,076
<i>(Nadia) We found Jack's call to Cheng.
We haven't decrypted it yet.</i>

268
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,550
The triangulation shows
he's travelling north on the 305.

269
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:53,555
- Anything between me and Santa Maria?
- Some small populated areas.

270
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,996
- When does the next one come up?
- Nine miles from where you are.

271
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:01,198
Check it out and work on that decryption.
I wanna know what Cheng and Jack said.

272
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,157
- OK.
- We're converging on Jack?

273
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,913
<i>- Yeah. Doyle's...
- (phone rings)</i>

274
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,470
<i>- Excuse me. Hi.
- (Karen) Hi, it's me. You have a minute?</i>

275
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:12,199
No. We're closing in on Jack. What is it?

276
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:15,955
We have to talk about something.
Call me when you have a few minutes.

277
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,600
OK. Everything all right?

278
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,911
Just do what you have to do
and call me when you can, OK?

279
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,991
<i>- All right.
- Bye.</i>

280
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,597
- Yes?
- Doyle's headed in the right direction.

281
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:34,993
We may have a chance to stop Jack before he
reaches Cheng. He's going north on the 305.

282
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,999
About there.

283
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:45,432
Let me call you back.
CTU made any progress in locating Bauer?

284
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,557
They're closing in
but they don't have him in custody yet.

285
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,110
You were right about Hock, Tom.
I need to talk to you.

286
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,997
All right, shoot.

287
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:58,596
Remember earlier when you threatened to
use that information to damage Bill and me?

288
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:01,513
<i>Yeah, mea culpa.
Why are we dredging this up now?</i>

289
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,955
No, no, Tom, it's not me.

290
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:08,716
It's Reed Pollock. He's looking for anything
to bargain his way out of the death penalty.

291
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,994
He can't.

292
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,753
Whether he can or he can't,
that ship has sailed.

293
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:17,470
Hock knows now that we released Fayed
from our custody two years ago in Seattle.

294
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:22,634
- OK, OK. What does Hock want?
- Distance from the presidency.

295
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:28,996
So, in other words,
either you or Bill has to take the blame.

296
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,355
Yeah, but it's more than blame, Tom.

297
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,319
There's gonna be enquiries, indictments.
Lives will be ruined.

298
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:39,678
Not lives. Careers.
Or rather one career, and it can't be yours.

299
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:44,635
Well, I can't do that to Bill, Tom.
He's my husband.

300
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:50,989
Well, he can go on being your husband.
But he sure can't keep running CTU.

301
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:54,959
- If he goes, I'm gonna resign.
- Haven't you already resigned once today?

302
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:58,555
That's Bill's signature
on Fayed's release document.

303
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,196
You know, it's over for Bill.

304
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:05,956
It's not for you.
I mean, you've got ajob here. Just do it.

305
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:13,199
- Tom, how can I ask him to step down?
- You don't ask.

306
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:18,354
You remind him that the man he let out ofjail
killed over 13,000 people this morning.

307
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,716
- Tom, he is not responsible for that!
- It doesn't matter.

308
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,836
- He has been amazing today.
- Look.

309
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:28,869
The only way for you to protect yourself
is to leave no doubt in anybody's mind

310
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,837
where your true loyalty lies.

311
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:33,036
They got Bill in their cross hairs, OK?

312
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:38,148
You wanna stand shoulder to shoulder
with your husband, that's your call.

313
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,671
<i>(sighs)</i>

314
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:20,517

If your matter is urgent, dial 0.</i>

315
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:24,434
<i>If this is not an urgent call,
please leave a message at the beep.</i>

316
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:30,311
It's Jack. I'm about to meet with Cheng and
exchange the sub-circuit board for Audrey.

317
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:34,837
Hopefully by the time you hear this
she'll be safe and in your custody.

318
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:38,071
I promised the president
that I would give him confirmation

319
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:41,118
that the circuit board
did not fall into the wrong hands.

320
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,839
This message is your confirmation.

321
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:47,754
The circuit board will be incinerated
in the explosion.

322
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:53,198
The meeting will take place
at the Calderone Hotel off of highway 305.

323
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:56,078
Bill,

324
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,799
please take care of Audrey.

325
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:02,073
Thank you.

326
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:05,038
You've been a good friend.

327
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,833
All right. Yeah.

328
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,674
- Do you have a second?
- What is it, Morris?

329
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,751
<i>(sighs)</i>

330
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:40,109
- I'd like to request a transfer.
- Why?

331
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,395
I need to get out of Comm.

332
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,790
- You wanna elaborate on that?
- Not really, no.

333
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:51,198
- You and Chloe having a problem?
- You could say that, yes.

334
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,198
- Can we talk about this in the morning?
- Nothing's gonna change.

335
00:25:56,280 --> 00:26:00,114
- You don't know that, Morris.
- I do. Look, please.

336
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:06,355
Figure out where you wanna put me.
Anywhere is fine. Just get me out of Comm.

337
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:14,599
All right. I'll work something out that...
is good for everyone involved.

338
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,391
Thank you.

339
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:29,232
<i>- (Karen) Hey.
- Did you wanna talk about something?</i>

340
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,117
Bill,

341
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:36,069
the DOJ investigator found out about when
you and Homeland had Fayed in custody.

342
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:40,597
It wasn't a secret. We did everything
by the book. I can deal with DOJ.

343
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:44,798
Yeah, I know, but the problem is
they're out for blood, Bill.

344
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,751
I can't let this touch me.

345
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,434
- Touch you? What are you talking about?
- Bill...

346
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:54,149
Why is this an issue?
Are you concerned I might implicate you?

347
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:59,792
- No! But there's guilt by association here.
- They're looking for a scapegoat?

348
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:03,759
Yes. The press are looking for anything
to attack the administration.

349
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,035
What are you saying?

350
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:13,239
I have to protect the White House and in order
to do that I have to distance myself from you.

351
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:17,233
How are you going to do that?
I'm your husband.

352
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,194
Are you asking me to resign?

353
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,791
No, Bill.

354
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,317
I have to fire you.

355
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:39,197
- Who's pressuring you, Karen?
- Look, this is the only way this can work.

356
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:42,033
It has to be immediate
or I'll be viewed as complicit

357
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:45,669
and my ability as national security advisor
will be undermined.

358
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,957
Undermined?
We're talking about the end of my career.

359
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,793
<i>- You don't think I've thought this through?
- No.</i>

360
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,155
You think I don't know what this means?

361
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,071
- No, I don't.
- Bill...

362
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:59,470
The public will make assumptions
that don't exist.

363
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:03,678
13,000 American lives lost. I had the man
in custody who was responsible.

364
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,593
I released him.
It won't matter that I had no evidence.

365
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:10,878
Look, you know how this works. One of us
has to take the fall and it can't be me.

366
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,918
I'm too close to the president.

367
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,754
I can't believe I'm hearing this.
Who is pressuring you, Karen?

368
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:22,391
You have to trust me on this, honey.
We will get through this, I promise.

369
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,029
And I love you,
and that's all that should matter here.

370
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,759

- Yes.

Why is it taking so long with Jack's call?

374
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,512
It just is. He used a double-length key
to slow us down.

375
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:58,151
- We're going as fast as we can.

He could be in the Central Valley by now.

Wait. I might have found something.

Well, he might have a lead.
He's checking it out now.

386
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:53,149
Come with me.

387
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,994
- I'm stepping down as director of CTU.
- What?

388
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:10,631
- What happened?
- All I can say is I have to step down.

389
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,075
No, sir, that doesn't make any sense.

390
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:18,188
- Why would you quit now, of all days?
- I'm not quitting.

391
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,200
I was fired.

392
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,871
By who?

393
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:26,997
It doesn't matter. I've contacted Division.

394
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:29,753
For now you're acting director.

395
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,677
Mr Buchanan. We've been ordered
to escort you off the premises.

396
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:42,551
I'm briefing Ms Yassir. She's taking over
as head of CTU. We'll need one more minute.

397
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,631
One minute.

398
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:50,115
We're in the middle of 50 different things.
Why would they do this now?

399
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:54,034
I can't talk about it. You need to accept it
and do the best you can.

400
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,190
I don't understand why they'd fire you.

401
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:59,511
You're the most ethical,
dedicated person I've ever known.

402
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:04,037
There's no way you did anything
to justify this.

403
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:06,475
Dammit, Bill, what is going on?

404
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:11,319
It's just politics.

405
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:15,590
Division will send over an interim director
in the next few hours.

406
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:18,433
In the meantime
you handle anything that comes up.

407
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:22,069
What about everything
I've had to go through today?

408
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:26,995
- I'm not the right choice to take over.
- I've lifted all your security restrictions.

409
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:30,197
You shouldn't have any trouble running CTU.

410
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,831
You are the right choice.

411
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:38,195
- I don't know what to say.
- Stay on top of the situation with Jack.

412
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:40,555
I will.

413
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,200
No one else knows I'm leaving.

414
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:46,829
You have to inform them
before it's posted on the internal forums.

415
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:49,115
I'll tell them.

416
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:59,080
What you said means a lot.

- He's gone.

422

What do you mean, he's gone?

423
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,471
I'm in charge.

424

Can I have everyone's attention?

In a few minutes you're gonna be getting
a bulletin on your systems.

426
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:46,429
Bill Buchanan has stepped down,

427
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:50,035
which means that until Division
can send over a replacement

428
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:52,190
he's named me acting director.

429
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:55,477
Nothing will change operationally.

430
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:58,279
Your objective remains the same.

431
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:03,036
Bring in Jack Bauer before he can hand over
the component to the Chinese.

432
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:39,392
- CTU, this is Doyle. Do you copy?
- Doyle, you're on comm. Go ahead.

Well, I found our truck. Either Jack switched
vehicles or he parked it and he's nearby.

435

I'm gonna look at the buildings.

There's infrastructure
we can check using thermal.

- What do you mean?
- A limo just pulled off the highway.

439
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:09,350
- Redirect nearby units to my current location.
- OK. Send alpha and delta teams.

440
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,352
- Also send Air One, Two and Three.

Cheng just left the car.

00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:48,358
<i>(Jack) That's far enough.</i>

443
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,192
Mr Bauer.

444
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,840
- Where's Audrey?
- She's in the car.

445
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:58,477
- Until I get that component...
- Nothing's gonna happen until I see Audrey.

446
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:01,358
I wanna make sure she's all right.

447
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,988
<i>(speaks Chinese)</i>

448
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:10,753
She's coming in now.

449
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,595
Audrey Raines is entering the premises.

450
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,319
I'm gonna need that backup.

451
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:23,436
- You have the sub-circuit board?
- You'll get it as soon as I know she's safe.

452
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,271
<i>(speaks Chinese)</i>

453
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,749
Take the gag out of her mouth.

454
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,714
Wait.

455
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,631
I'll do it.

456
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,711
<i>(speaks Chinese)</i>

457
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:14,120
I'm so sorry.

458
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:20,711
You can continue this reunion later.
How is this gonna work, Mr Bauer?

459
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,071
Audrey walks out of here alone.

460
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,799
As soon as I see
that she gets down near the bridge,

461
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,678
I know she's out of the range of your sniper.

462
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,796
Then I'll give you the component.

463
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:34,553
There's at least ten guns.
I need the field teams.

464
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,029
Let's do this.

465
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:43,473
I want you to walk past the bridge
100 yards on the right side of the road.

466
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:46,597
There's a gas station
and a cab will be waiting for you.

467
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:50,468
He has instructions to take you back to CTU.

468
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,035
You need to go.

469
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,076
This is going down now, Nadia.
Where are the field teams?

470
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:11,197
- They'll be there any minute.
- I need to do something now.

471
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,953
Jack is about to hand over the component.

472
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,996
Mike, don't let that happen.

473
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:25,070
Give me the circuit board or I'll kill her.

474
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,836
Stay where you are.

475
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,752
<i>(speaks Chinese)</i>

476
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:14,034
<i>- (man) This is Air One. Do you copy?
- Go ahead.</i>

477
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:18,477
<i>Cheng and his men have escaped. They're
in three black Hummers heading north.</i>

478
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:21,518
- They're travelling off road.
- Pursue and engage.

479
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:33,356
<i>We've been hit! CTU, this is Air One.
We're going down. I repeat, we're going down.</i>

480
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,591
<i>(grunts)</i>

481
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:23,796
- Weapons down!
- Get on the ground now!

482
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:26,633
- Who is your commanding officer?
- I am, Jack.

483
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:29,314
Stand him up.

484
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,392
- Where's the sub-circuit board?
- Cheng's got it.

485
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:36,473
I was set to blow the building and destroy it
till you engaged us in a fight.

486
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,755
Here's the detonator.

487
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,554
- What's the problem?
- We don't have Cheng.

488
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:46,438
- What?
- The teams didn't have time to get into place.

489
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:52,117
We had to make a frontal assault. He must've
escaped out the rear. Nadia, did you get that?

490
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,794
We've got a chopper down.
We need other choppers.

491
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:59,635
The choppers should be there in five minutes.
They reported seeing Cheng and his men

492
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:04,077
travelling in three black Hummers
in the mountains, off road, travelling north.

493
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:07,038
- Copy that.
- Now place Jack under arrest.

494
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:09,509
<i>(Doyle) Understood.</i>

495
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:16,672
- Is he gone?
- Yeah. I gotta take you into custody, Jack.

496
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:21,834
I had this handled.
Why the hell didn't you listen to me?

497
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,477
Audrey, it's over. You're safe.

498
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:33,199
- Help me. Don't let them do this to me.
- Audrey...

499
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,431
- Help me, Jack. Don't let them do this to me.
- Audrey!

500
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,556
It's me. I'm right here.

501
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:46,588
Do you even know who I am?

502
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,591
Sit her down.

503
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,875
Audrey. Audrey.

504
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:55,556
- They've done something to her. Help her.
- We will. Let's go, Jack.

505
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:06,556
My God.

506
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,431
