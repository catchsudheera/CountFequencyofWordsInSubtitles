1
00:00:14,807 --> 00:00:17,765
I'm reprogramming
the CTU key card right now.

2
00:00:17,846 --> 00:00:22,841
Good. Couriers are delivering the canisters
to the targets. They'll be in place soon.

3
00:00:22,926 --> 00:00:28,603
<i>- When are you launching the attacks?
- After you're done at CTU.</i>

4
00:00:28,966 --> 00:00:32,515
When these terrorists attack,
you'll need to maintain order.

5
00:00:32,606 --> 00:00:37,999
We should think of a pre-emptive declaration
of martial law in the greater Los Angeles area.

6
00:00:38,086 --> 00:00:41,840
If CTU can't find this man Bierko,
we're gonna get hit.

7
00:00:42,245 --> 00:00:45,123
Why didn't you just tell me you were alive?

8
00:00:45,206 --> 00:00:48,835
If you knew I was alive
you would have been at risk. I had no choice.

9
00:00:48,926 --> 00:00:51,234
I'm happy that you're alive. I am.

10
00:00:51,325 --> 00:00:54,044
But I can't give you what you want right now.

11
00:00:54,406 --> 00:00:57,124
Michelle's murder was part of a bigger plan

12
00:00:57,205 --> 00:00:59,720
to supply terrorists with Sentox nerve gas.

13
00:00:59,805 --> 00:01:02,842
- Who was behind it?
Christopher Henderson.

14
00:01:02,926 --> 00:01:07,680
Whatever he's not telling us is important.
He can tolerate an inhuman amount of pain.

15
00:01:07,765 --> 00:01:13,601
Thousands of lives are at stake. Tell me what
I need to know to stop this insanity. Please.

16
00:01:13,685 --> 00:01:16,961
I'm sorry, Jack,
but I can't tell you what you wanna know.

17
00:01:17,045 --> 00:01:19,878
This is Bauer.

18
00:01:19,964 --> 00:01:25,277
We've been compromised. Someone used
a stolen key card to access CTU.

19
00:01:25,365 --> 00:01:27,832
Freeze! Drop the gun.

20
00:01:30,085 --> 00:01:33,157
Bill, it's Jack.
I think he tried to deploy nerve gas.

21
00:01:33,245 --> 00:01:37,283
Code six! Everybody out! Go! Go!

22
00:01:37,365 --> 00:01:39,161
Seal all the rooms.

23
00:01:44,124 --> 00:01:45,477
Oh, no.

24
00:01:45,564 --> 00:01:46,963
Oh, my God.

25
00:01:49,564 --> 00:01:51,713
Chloe.

26
00:02:12,643 --> 00:02:15,317
<i>Attention all CTU personnel.</i>

27
00:02:15,403 --> 00:02:19,794
<i>This facility has been contaminated
with Sentox VX-1 nerve gas.</i>

28
00:02:19,884 --> 00:02:24,399
<i>I repeat, this facility has been contaminated.</i>

29
00:02:24,483 --> 00:02:28,920
<i>There are two safe zones. On the main floor,
in the situation room and Medical.</i>

30
00:02:29,003 --> 00:02:32,472
<i>On the second floor,
the safe zones are the CTU director's office,</i>

31
00:02:32,563 --> 00:02:35,157
<i>and holding room four.</i>

32
00:02:35,723 --> 00:02:40,671
<i>These areas must remain sealed pending
the arrival of the Chemical Response Team.</i>

33
00:02:40,762 --> 00:02:44,437
<i>If you are in any of these sealed areas,
do not attempt to leave</i>

34
00:02:44,523 --> 00:02:48,117
<i>until the CRT clears the environment.</i>

35
00:02:48,202 --> 00:02:52,480
I'm on my way, but it could take 30 minutes
to gather all the CRT personnel you need.

36
00:02:52,562 --> 00:02:56,919
I understand, Curtis, but we need CRT here
now. This is a high priority.

37
00:02:57,002 --> 00:03:01,200
- Get here as fast as you can.
- Copy. I'll call in a few minutes with updates.

38
00:03:03,122 --> 00:03:05,511
Excuse me.

39
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:08,878
<i>- This is Bauer.
- Jack, it's Bill. I just talked to Curtis.</i>

40
00:03:08,962 --> 00:03:10,953
<i>He's with the Chemical Response Team.</i>

41
00:03:11,042 --> 00:03:14,078
<i>- They won't get here for at least 30 minutes.
- Why not?</i>

42
00:03:14,162 --> 00:03:18,474
Most were sent to Tyler Memorial. The rest
are en route to high probability targets.

43
00:03:18,562 --> 00:03:21,200
We'll keep working.
Our networks are up, right?

44
00:03:21,282 --> 00:03:25,638
The phones are working, computers are up.
I can coordinate with Division from here.

45
00:03:25,722 --> 00:03:28,713
- What do you need?
- I need to know if Henderson's alive.

46
00:03:28,801 --> 00:03:32,237
<i>- Where is he?
- Agent Burke took him to the isolation clinic.</i>

47
00:03:32,321 --> 00:03:34,357
I don't know if they made it.

48
00:03:34,441 --> 00:03:38,275
- You can tell if you pull up a grid.
- What about CTU's response plan?

49
00:03:38,361 --> 00:03:41,433
Gas masks are in the armoury,
atropine's in storage.

50
00:03:41,521 --> 00:03:45,719
Both areas are contaminated.
We can't get to them without being exposed.

51
00:03:46,201 --> 00:03:49,079
Bill, I'm gonna have to get right back to you.

52
00:03:53,161 --> 00:03:57,278
Chloe, I know how difficult this is,
but there's nothing we can do for him.

53
00:03:57,361 --> 00:04:00,033
I need you to come back to work.

54
00:04:00,121 --> 00:04:03,192
Tell me how to pull up a building grid.
I'll do it myself.

55
00:04:03,281 --> 00:04:06,636
- Jack, we can try to pull it up.
- Get started.

56
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:12,589
Chloe, CTU is immobile right now.
Everything is going to go through Comm.

57
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,797
That's you. I need you back at work.

58
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,279
- Can't.
- Yes, you can.

59
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,713
- I can't.
- Yes, you can!

60
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,916
Mr. Bauer.

61
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,198
- What?
- I can help her.

62
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,316
I'm a clinical psychologist.

63
00:04:37,799 --> 00:04:39,869
Thank you.

64
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,471
Chloe.

65
00:04:46,559 --> 00:04:50,552
My name's Dr Landes.
He was a friend of yours. What was his name?

66
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,595
- Edgar.
- Edgar.

67
00:04:52,679 --> 00:04:56,035
I'd like you to turn away from Edgar
and focus on me, please.

68
00:04:56,119 --> 00:04:57,837
Chloe,

69
00:04:57,918 --> 00:05:02,036
you're in shock,
and I'd like to help you through it.

70
00:05:02,119 --> 00:05:06,351
The only thing I'm gonna ask you to do
is sit in this chair and collect your breath.

71
00:05:06,438 --> 00:05:08,669
Let's do that now.

72
00:05:17,278 --> 00:05:20,350
Just collect your breath, just for a second.

73
00:05:21,838 --> 00:05:26,866
He was such a good guy.
I just treated him like crap all day.

74
00:05:32,558 --> 00:05:35,436
- This is my fault.
- Sir?

75
00:05:36,678 --> 00:05:39,750
Someone stole my key card
and used it to get in the building.

76
00:05:39,838 --> 00:05:43,513
It was missing, and I didn't say anything.

77
00:05:44,317 --> 00:05:47,832
- Why not?
- I thought they stole my wallet for money.

78
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:50,512
How could you not report it?

79
00:05:50,597 --> 00:05:53,236
I was embarrassed.

80
00:05:53,317 --> 00:05:56,548
I didn't want anyone to know I got beat up.

81
00:05:57,637 --> 00:06:01,710
So we're all gonna die
because you were embarrassed?

82
00:06:07,157 --> 00:06:10,069
- What are you doing?
- I wanna know what's going on.

83
00:06:10,157 --> 00:06:14,196
- No, I can't allow that.
- I won't sit in bed while CTU's under attack.

84
00:06:14,277 --> 00:06:15,949
Fine.

85
00:06:16,037 --> 00:06:21,030
- How long are we supposed to be like this?
- I haven't received any news.

86
00:06:21,117 --> 00:06:23,346
Oh, my God.

87
00:06:26,516 --> 00:06:29,190
Jack, we've got the building grid.

88
00:06:32,237 --> 00:06:34,466
<i>- Buchanan.
- It's Jack. The grid's up.</i>

89
00:06:34,556 --> 00:06:39,425
All right. Check the isolation zones
that have logged in. They'll have survivors.

90
00:06:39,516 --> 00:06:41,746
Two zones have logged on in Medical.

91
00:06:41,836 --> 00:06:45,749
- Try them. I'm gonna keep this line open.
- OK. Hold on.

92
00:06:47,355 --> 00:06:49,426
<i>- Clinic.
- Dr Besson, it's Jack Bauer.</i>

93
00:06:49,516 --> 00:06:50,710
What's going on?

94
00:06:50,795 --> 00:06:55,950
A terrorist infiltrated CTU and deployed
Sentox through the ventilation system.

95
00:06:56,035 --> 00:07:01,393
That's why we sealed off rooms. I need to
know if Burke got to Medical with Henderson.

96
00:07:01,476 --> 00:07:04,387
- Yes, he did.
- Henderson's here right now?

97
00:07:04,476 --> 00:07:07,785
- Tony, is that you?
- How long are we gonna be locked down?

98
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:13,394
<i>Right now we're in stand-by. We're trying
to figure out how to clean out the air supply.</i>

99
00:07:13,475 --> 00:07:15,147
Doctor Besson?

100
00:07:15,235 --> 00:07:17,510
<i>Doctor Besson?</i>

101
00:07:17,595 --> 00:07:19,472
Tony?

102
00:07:20,395 --> 00:07:23,387
- Get a security feed.
- This program's not set up for that.

103
00:07:23,475 --> 00:07:27,024
Try a redirect. Doctor Besson?

104
00:07:43,555 --> 00:07:45,352
- What are you doing?
- Move aside.

105
00:07:45,434 --> 00:07:48,824
All right, I've got video.

106
00:07:48,914 --> 00:07:52,031
Oh, God. He's got a gun.
Patch me through to their intercom.

107
00:07:52,114 --> 00:07:54,753
- Do it.
- We can hear them, but they can't hear us.

108
00:07:54,834 --> 00:07:58,383
<i>- Don't kill him. He's got information we need.
- He killed my wife!</i>

109
00:07:58,474 --> 00:08:01,113
- Tony, please, don't kill him.
- Move aside.

110
00:08:01,194 --> 00:08:04,072
I don't want to shoot you, but I will. Move it!

111
00:08:08,553 --> 00:08:10,431
You remember me?

112
00:08:10,513 --> 00:08:12,788
My name is Tony Almeida.

113
00:08:12,874 --> 00:08:15,672
You killed my wife,
Michelle Dessler, this morning.

114
00:08:15,753 --> 00:08:18,109
He's gonna kill him. Hurry. Hurry!

115
00:08:18,193 --> 00:08:21,948
She was my life, and you took her.

116
00:08:22,433 --> 00:08:25,186
And now I'm gonna take yours.

117
00:08:25,753 --> 00:08:28,745
- I got it.
- Tony, I've got you on the security feed.

118
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:31,666
<i>- Stay out of this, Jack.
- Please, just listen to me.</i>

119
00:08:31,753 --> 00:08:33,823
You can't do this.

120
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:37,472
I know how you feel right now.

121
00:08:40,792 --> 00:08:44,229
I lost Teri the exact same way,
to one of our own.

122
00:08:44,313 --> 00:08:47,463
I know what it feels to be betrayed like this.

123
00:08:48,033 --> 00:08:53,471
But, Tony, Henderson has information that
can save thousands and thousands of lives.

124
00:08:53,552 --> 00:08:59,149
And I know that doesn't make you feel
better right now, but I know you, Tony.

125
00:08:59,232 --> 00:09:04,226
I know you don't want
to make this situation any worse than it is.

126
00:09:04,312 --> 00:09:06,223
Please.

127
00:09:09,112 --> 00:09:12,661
Please just let us finish our interrogation.

128
00:09:19,471 --> 00:09:20,746
Hurry up.

129
00:09:22,952 --> 00:09:26,580
Agent Burke, please continue.
When Henderson starts talking,

130
00:09:26,672 --> 00:09:32,190
focus on how to find the Sentox canisters
and how we can find Bierko.

131
00:09:36,631 --> 00:09:38,667
Tell me where to find Bierko.

132
00:09:41,711 --> 00:09:43,064
Where?

133
00:09:45,191 --> 00:09:47,147
Nowhere.

134
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:50,226
What is your computer password?

135
00:09:50,311 --> 00:09:52,302
No.

136
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:55,030
No password.

137
00:09:56,230 --> 00:10:00,906
<i>- Agent Burke, can we increase the dose?
- Not without killing him.</i>

138
00:10:00,991 --> 00:10:04,461
Take a break then start again.
Get back to me when you've got anything.

139
00:10:04,551 --> 00:10:06,542
Yes, sir.

140
00:10:10,591 --> 00:10:14,185
<i>- How could CTU be hit?
- We're not sure, Mr. Vice President.</i>

141
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:16,910
Are you telling me
they didn't have any safeguards?

142
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:19,743
They had partial containment,
but reports indicate

143
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:22,788
that 40% % of their personnel
have been taken out.

144
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:26,658
- You mean, they've been killed.
- I'm afraid so, sir.

145
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:31,266
CTU is protecting this city. Are you saying
they're no longer capable of doing that?

146
00:10:31,349 --> 00:10:33,705
They've been seriously compromised, yes.

147
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:39,183
What are we going to do? We've got terrorists
with nerve gas out there. Who will stop them?

148
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:43,468
- I suggest an emergency restructuring.
- Meaning what?

149
00:10:43,549 --> 00:10:47,144
The Chemical Response Team will go in,
neutralise the gas at CTU,

150
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:51,427
and I will take a team in there
and personally manage the operation.

151
00:10:51,509 --> 00:10:53,785
<i>- How soon can you do that?
- Within the hour.</i>

152
00:10:53,869 --> 00:10:56,099
<i>- Fine. Do it.
- Yes, sir.</i>

153
00:10:56,189 --> 00:10:59,340
All right. We're operational.
It's not a complete disaster.

154
00:10:59,429 --> 00:11:01,897
Mr. President, it is.

155
00:11:01,989 --> 00:11:05,982
I can see no other option but to impose
martial law on the city of Los Angeles.

156
00:11:06,069 --> 00:11:11,382
My advisors believe if the military takes over
and detains people, it could create mayhem.

157
00:11:11,469 --> 00:11:15,461
It's only a matter of time before
more canisters are released in public places

158
00:11:15,548 --> 00:11:19,063
and you will have mayhem,
except without soldiers to contain it.

159
00:11:19,149 --> 00:11:23,903
What do I tell the public? We've got nerve gas
all over the city, but we don't know where?

160
00:11:23,989 --> 00:11:28,186
You don't have to get into that.
Tie it to that earlier incident at the airport.

161
00:11:28,268 --> 00:11:32,625
- I'm going to get resistance from all sides.
- That's true, sir.

162
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:36,496
We may have to swallow some saltwater,
but wouldn't it be worth it?

163
00:11:36,588 --> 00:11:40,865
If we can keep the people off the streets,
safe from another public attack?

164
00:11:40,948 --> 00:11:44,224
- I don't know, Hal.
- Sir, consider this.

165
00:11:44,307 --> 00:11:48,221
If we clear the streets
of everybody except the military,

166
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:51,698
these terrorists won't be able to move
as freely as they are now.

167
00:11:51,788 --> 00:11:56,657
We have to do whatever we can
to stop the people behind this.

168
00:12:02,907 --> 00:12:06,866
CTU is no longer an obstacle,
at least for the time being.

169
00:12:06,947 --> 00:12:11,782
Good. Have our men move from their
current positions and go to the new target.

170
00:12:11,867 --> 00:12:15,018
How much of the nerve gas
will they release there?

171
00:12:15,107 --> 00:12:17,098
All of it.

172
00:12:33,387 --> 00:12:35,776
Excuse me.

173
00:12:39,466 --> 00:12:42,663
- Chloe, are you ready to go back to work?
- What do you need?

174
00:12:42,746 --> 00:12:48,104
You. We can't break Henderson. I need you
to try to decrypt the files from his computer.

175
00:12:48,186 --> 00:12:50,905
I tried. It didn't work.
Maybe somebody else can do it.

176
00:12:50,986 --> 00:12:54,661
Chloe, you're the only person
in the room qualified.

177
00:12:54,746 --> 00:12:57,340
Chloe, please. Don't shut down on me now.

178
00:12:57,425 --> 00:13:02,864
I'm upset about everything too, but you know
how it works. We do not quit until it's over.

179
00:13:02,946 --> 00:13:07,736
You're not helping her.
You're just making things worse.

180
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:14,176
I am sure that you are qualified
to help someone through distress

181
00:13:14,266 --> 00:13:18,656
over an extended period of time, but we
do not have an extended period of time.

182
00:13:18,745 --> 00:13:22,260
If you don't mind stepping aside
so I can do my job, I'd appreciate it.

183
00:13:22,345 --> 00:13:26,179
You don't have to be qualified to help people,
you just have to be there.

184
00:13:26,265 --> 00:13:29,416
Like you were there for my daughter.

185
00:13:29,504 --> 00:13:31,780
What does that mean?

186
00:13:33,585 --> 00:13:36,895
You're 20 years older than she is.
I know what you're doing.

187
00:13:36,985 --> 00:13:41,217
I've done nothing but try and help her. How
dare you accuse me of taking advantage?

188
00:13:41,304 --> 00:13:42,896
You did.

189
00:13:42,984 --> 00:13:45,579
Dad, you can be angry at me all you want.

190
00:13:45,665 --> 00:13:50,055
But before I met Barry, I didn't want to live.
Do you understand that?

191
00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:55,061
Fine, I'll get back to work.
If everyone could just relax.

192
00:13:56,225 --> 00:13:58,454
Jack, we have a problem.

193
00:14:00,824 --> 00:14:03,213
What?

194
00:14:05,304 --> 00:14:07,943
Chloe, I just saw the alarm. What's going on?

195
00:14:08,024 --> 00:14:13,257
Pressure indicators in contaminated zones
are showing traces of sublimated polymer.

196
00:14:13,344 --> 00:14:18,418
- What does that mean?
- The nerve gas must be mixed with an acid.

197
00:14:18,503 --> 00:14:21,973
The acid's breaking down
the seal between the rooms.

198
00:14:22,063 --> 00:14:26,420
<i>- How long till the seal fails completely?
- It's hard to say for sure.</i>

199
00:14:26,503 --> 00:14:29,415
<i>- Give me an estimate.
- It's deteriorating quickly.</i>

200
00:14:29,503 --> 00:14:32,575
- 15 minutes, 20 at the most.
- And then what?

201
00:14:33,383 --> 00:14:36,534
Gas permeates the seal and enters the room.
Then it's over.

202
00:14:36,623 --> 00:14:40,138
Get me schematics on all the isolated zones.

203
00:14:48,143 --> 00:14:53,376
Mr. Vice President, with all due respect,
I'm not trying to usurp your position.

204
00:14:53,462 --> 00:14:58,377
I'm simply trying to serve the president
the best way I can.

205
00:14:58,463 --> 00:15:00,852
Yes, sir.

206
00:15:02,623 --> 00:15:04,853
What was that about?

207
00:15:05,982 --> 00:15:10,453
I was trying to convince Gardner to let me
help him draft the president's statement.

208
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:13,295
Charles is letting Hal write his statement?

209
00:15:13,382 --> 00:15:17,933
He's insisted.
And the president gave him the go-ahead.

210
00:15:18,022 --> 00:15:21,571
That means Gardner's effectively
making policy. You gotta stop him.

211
00:15:21,662 --> 00:15:23,334
I'm trying.

212
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:27,573
But you know the pressure he's under today.
He wants all the counsel he can get.

213
00:15:27,662 --> 00:15:29,653
And Hal's only too eager to help out.

214
00:15:29,742 --> 00:15:32,859
Of course he's eager.
He's got his eye on the Oval Office.

215
00:15:32,942 --> 00:15:37,378
Anything he can do to speed up Charles's
downfall puts him closer to the presidency.

216
00:15:37,462 --> 00:15:39,019
Martha,

217
00:15:39,102 --> 00:15:41,456
you have to intervene.

218
00:15:41,542 --> 00:15:43,771
Hal feeds the president ideas.

219
00:15:43,861 --> 00:15:46,329
We saw it at the WTO. We saw it in Chicago.

220
00:15:46,421 --> 00:15:51,779
When they work, Hal takes the credit for 'em.
When they don't, the president takes the hits.

221
00:15:51,861 --> 00:15:54,455
- Have you reminded Charles of that?
- I can't.

222
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:58,932
Hal's the vice president.
I'm just the Chief of Staff.

223
00:16:01,701 --> 00:16:05,171
You have influence
that supersedes any constitutional rank.

224
00:16:05,261 --> 00:16:08,651
And now's the time to use it.

225
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:18,656
- I want to see the statement when it's issued.
- You will.

226
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:26,772
I checked the readings
from all uncontaminated zones.

227
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:30,409
<i>The testing you've been doing
in your respective areas is consistent.</i>

228
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:34,573
<i>The Sentox gas released into the air duct
system contains a corrosive agent</i>

229
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,970
<i>that is eating away
at the barrier seals protecting safe zones.</i>

230
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:42,450
<i>I'm not gonna pull any punches.
CRT will not be here in time to help us.</i>

231
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:45,099
<i>At this point,
our only hope is to help ourselves.</i>

232
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:50,572
<i>We need to find a way to either neutralise
or flush the Sentox out of contaminated areas</i>

233
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:54,811
<i>before the barrier seals fail,
and the gas enters the safe zones.</i>

234
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:59,337
<i>I want all personnel working on this problem.
We don't have much time.</i>

235
00:16:59,419 --> 00:17:01,729
Do what you can.

236
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:04,458
We'll hope for the best.

237
00:17:04,539 --> 00:17:07,656
Maybe we can do something.
Access the ventilation system.

238
00:17:07,739 --> 00:17:10,776
Even if I could,
it doesn't mean we could do anything.

239
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:12,850
Just try.

240
00:17:17,979 --> 00:17:20,413
Maybe it's not so bad.
Maybe the numbers are off.

241
00:17:20,498 --> 00:17:21,932
They're not.

242
00:17:22,018 --> 00:17:25,533
Even if the seals leak,
CRT could get here in time.

243
00:17:26,538 --> 00:17:30,816
The only reason she's here
is because I asked her to stay.

244
00:17:31,819 --> 00:17:35,572
If something happens to her,
it's going to be because of what I did.

245
00:17:35,658 --> 00:17:38,491
There is no way you could know
that CTU was vulnerable.

246
00:17:38,579 --> 00:17:40,648
Jack.

247
00:17:40,738 --> 00:17:42,091
Have you got something?

248
00:17:42,178 --> 00:17:46,376
If I slow the seals' breakdown,
I can flush the area using the air conditioning.

249
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:48,449
Do it.

250
00:17:50,058 --> 00:17:52,810
- Something's wrong. It isn't responding.
- Why not?

251
00:17:52,898 --> 00:17:55,457
It's being blocked
by some program I can't get to,

252
00:17:55,538 --> 00:17:57,892
probably on a computer near holding four.

253
00:17:57,978 --> 00:18:01,971
- Can you get me in there?
- This is a false wall. The air in there is clean.

254
00:18:02,057 --> 00:18:04,413
- Can he get to the computer?
- Yes.

255
00:18:04,498 --> 00:18:07,409
But after the safe zone,
he'll be in a contaminated area.

256
00:18:07,498 --> 00:18:09,965
What? He can't go through
a contaminated area.

257
00:18:10,057 --> 00:18:13,732
I can hold my breath. Sentox
won't be absorbed over that short a time.

258
00:18:13,818 --> 00:18:17,207
- I'll be fine.
- You can't hold your breath that long.

259
00:18:17,297 --> 00:18:22,451
I only have to get to the computer, disconnect
the program and get to the ventilated room.

260
00:18:22,537 --> 00:18:25,415
Once I'm back,
how long will it take to clear the Sentox?

261
00:18:25,496 --> 00:18:28,614
About 20 seconds,
based on the cubic footage.

262
00:18:29,577 --> 00:18:35,094
- Jack, what if we can't ventilate that room?
- Chloe thinks we can. This is our only option.

263
00:18:35,177 --> 00:18:39,409
- CRT is not gonna get here in time.
- The seals are now 80% % gone.

264
00:18:39,496 --> 00:18:43,536
- What's the bottom line?
- We have less than 20 minutes.

265
00:18:43,616 --> 00:18:47,529
We are on channel one. If you need
anyone else, we'll patch you through.

266
00:18:47,616 --> 00:18:50,767
As soon as I go through,
you have to replace this behind me.

267
00:18:50,857 --> 00:18:53,654
Jack, it's time. Go now.

268
00:18:53,737 --> 00:18:55,692
Now.

269
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:10,769
<i>Chloe, I just completed the airlock. I'm getting
ready to move into the ventilation room.</i>

270
00:20:10,854 --> 00:20:13,846
<i>I'll tap my comm unit
when I'm back in the safe room.</i>

271
00:20:13,934 --> 00:20:18,962
All right. Jack, if that airlock leaks, we'll
all be dead within the next three minutes.

272
00:20:19,054 --> 00:20:21,887
<i>It's not gonna leak, Chloe.</i>

273
00:20:21,974 --> 00:20:23,850
OK.

274
00:20:23,934 --> 00:20:26,607
<i>- I'm going in.
- OK.</i>

275
00:21:29,011 --> 00:21:32,561
- The seal corrosion is now at 86%.
- Is there anything we can do here?

276
00:21:32,652 --> 00:21:36,088
Just wait. There's nothing we can do
to get your dad out any faster.

277
00:21:36,171 --> 00:21:40,483
- Don't talk down to me, Chloe.
- Listen, we're in a crisis situation here, OK?

278
00:21:40,571 --> 00:21:43,325
Tempers are bound to flare.
Just everybody breathe.

279
00:21:43,412 --> 00:21:48,361
What's with you and the breathing?
Is that your solution to everything?

280
00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:57,759
- He's back in the room.
- It's too soon.

281
00:21:57,851 --> 00:22:01,241
He couldn't have found the program
and disabled it yet.

282
00:22:01,331 --> 00:22:05,085
He's got 15 more seconds
before the room clears.

283
00:22:06,131 --> 00:22:08,804
- What's it mean that he's finished?
- I don't know.

284
00:22:08,891 --> 00:22:11,610
- It could be good, right?
- It could be good or bad.

285
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:14,966
That's what "I don't know" means.

286
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:18,846
All right, the room is clear. Are you OK?

287
00:22:22,491 --> 00:22:25,288
I couldn't get to it.
Chloe, you're right, I saw it.

288
00:22:25,371 --> 00:22:30,160
There's a program running on the AC control,
but there's a security grate behind the vent.

289
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:33,879
- I don't see it on my system.
- Trust me, it's there.

290
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:40,525
I just found it. It was a security upgrade
in the last two years.

291
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:43,363
Somebody didn't file it properly
so I didn't see it.

292
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:45,486
Are there other vents into that wall?

293
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:49,563
<i>- They've all been upgraded.
- There's gotta be a door. Where does it lead?</i>

294
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:52,925
To a corridor above holding four.
None of us can get there.

295
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:55,569
- Who's in holding room four?
- Lynn McGill.

296
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:58,117
Are there any vented rooms
we can get him to?

297
00:22:58,209 --> 00:23:00,439
<i>No, Jack. There's nothing.</i>

298
00:23:05,369 --> 00:23:08,167
Patch me through to him.

299
00:23:10,729 --> 00:23:12,924
<i>- McGill here.
- Lynn, it's Jack.</i>

300
00:23:13,009 --> 00:23:15,648
<i>We found a computer interrupt
in the AC control.</i>

301
00:23:15,729 --> 00:23:20,166
If we shut that down in the next few minutes,
we can stop the gas permeating safe zones.

302
00:23:20,248 --> 00:23:22,160
Well, that's good news.

303
00:23:22,249 --> 00:23:26,128
<i>The problem is, you're the only person
close enough to get to it. Chloe?</i>

304
00:23:26,209 --> 00:23:28,324
It's above the room where you are now.

305
00:23:28,409 --> 00:23:31,958
Take the stairs, go around the corner,
it's the room on your left.

306
00:23:32,048 --> 00:23:34,961
OK. How are we gonna do this, Jack?

307
00:23:35,049 --> 00:23:39,918
Lynn, the truth is if I could get there, I would
do this myself, but I'm not close enough.

308
00:23:40,008 --> 00:23:43,159
No one still alive is.
You're the only person who can do this.

309
00:23:43,248 --> 00:23:45,478
<i>But you have to do it without protection.</i>

310
00:23:45,568 --> 00:23:48,446
<i>- I see.
- No, you don't.</i>

311
00:23:48,528 --> 00:23:52,203
<i>As soon as you open the door,
your room will become contaminated.</i>

312
00:23:52,288 --> 00:23:57,646
You can hold your breath long enough
to fix the problem, but we can't airlock you.

313
00:23:57,728 --> 00:24:00,162
There are two of us in here, Jack.

314
00:24:00,248 --> 00:24:03,045
Sir, this is Harry Swinton.

315
00:24:03,128 --> 00:24:07,723
So you're saying that if he does this,
then we're both gonna die?

316
00:24:07,808 --> 00:24:10,002
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

317
00:24:10,087 --> 00:24:12,283
We don't have a choice, Harry.

318
00:24:12,368 --> 00:24:16,838
How do we know that you're not making this
up so you don't have to sacrifice yourself?

319
00:24:16,927 --> 00:24:21,318
<i>You don't. All I can ask you to do
is believe me. I'm telling you the truth.</i>

320
00:24:21,408 --> 00:24:24,286
That's easy for you to say, sir.
You're not about to die.

321
00:24:24,367 --> 00:24:27,166
It's not easy for me to say.

322
00:24:28,007 --> 00:24:30,646
Hold on.

323
00:24:32,647 --> 00:24:39,200
We have to do this, Harry. We're gonna die
anyway. If we don't, so will everyone in CTU.

324
00:24:40,007 --> 00:24:41,998
We have to do this.

325
00:24:48,967 --> 00:24:50,400
OK, Jack. Go ahead.

326
00:24:50,487 --> 00:24:54,560
Once you get into the ventilation room,
the computer will be on your right.

327
00:24:54,646 --> 00:24:58,401
<i>There's a program running
on the computer. You need to quit out of it.</i>

328
00:24:58,486 --> 00:25:01,445
<i>Lynn, we don't have a lot of time.</i>

329
00:25:03,686 --> 00:25:05,677
I'll do it.

330
00:25:31,525 --> 00:25:33,357
Chloe,

331
00:25:33,445 --> 00:25:37,438
I'm sorry about how I acted earlier,
and about your friend that died.

332
00:25:37,526 --> 00:25:39,322
OK.

333
00:25:39,405 --> 00:25:43,398
- Thanks.
- I've been wanting to ask you something.

334
00:25:43,485 --> 00:25:47,763
Did you have contact with my dad
while he was gone?

335
00:25:47,845 --> 00:25:51,519
- I sent him information about once a month.
- What kind of information?

336
00:25:51,605 --> 00:25:54,438
- A lot of different things.
- About me?

337
00:25:55,045 --> 00:25:59,914
Actually, almost all of it was about you.
Your break-up with Chase, your depression.

338
00:26:00,005 --> 00:26:03,758
- How did you get...
- I'm really good at getting information.

339
00:26:03,845 --> 00:26:06,358
I don’t judge it, I just pass it on.

340
00:26:06,445 --> 00:26:09,959
I'm sorry about you and Chase.
It must have been really painful.

341
00:26:10,045 --> 00:26:12,320
Yeah. It was.

342
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:14,440
So you talked to him too?

343
00:26:14,524 --> 00:26:17,721
- Chase? No.
- You know where he is?

344
00:26:17,804 --> 00:26:21,956
- No, but I could find out if you want.
- No, no. It's all right.

345
00:26:22,044 --> 00:26:25,673
Barry thinks I should let that go.
He's probably right.

346
00:26:25,764 --> 00:26:32,033
Yeah, well, shrinks are always giving advice
that they probably don't follow themselves.

347
00:26:32,124 --> 00:26:36,675
- How are you doing?
- I woke up with a guy I'll never see again.

348
00:26:36,764 --> 00:26:42,316
And I just watched one of my best friends die
right in front of me, so I guess not that great.

349
00:26:43,084 --> 00:26:44,641
Yeah.

350
00:26:58,483 --> 00:27:03,796
Replace the panel. Pull up the security feed
from the observation room.

351
00:27:05,363 --> 00:27:08,241
You be a good girl for Mommy, OK?

352
00:27:08,323 --> 00:27:11,599
If she tells you you have to go to bed,
you have to go to bed.

353
00:27:11,682 --> 00:27:16,198
<i>- When are you coming home?
- I don't know, honey.</i>

354
00:27:16,283 --> 00:27:20,480
<i>- If I fall asleep, will you wake me up?
- Of course I will.</i>

355
00:27:20,562 --> 00:27:22,518
<i>- Yeah?
- Yeah.</i>

356
00:27:22,603 --> 00:27:24,274
<i>OK.</i>

357
00:27:24,363 --> 00:27:28,071
I'm going in now, Harry. Say goodbye.

358
00:27:28,162 --> 00:27:31,120
<i>- I love you.
- I love you too, Daddy.</i>

359
00:27:31,962 --> 00:27:34,192
Bye, baby girl.

360
00:27:36,602 --> 00:27:38,990
Chloe, we're ready. I'm going in.

361
00:27:39,522 --> 00:27:42,559
OK. Good luck. And thanks for doing this.

362
00:27:44,841 --> 00:27:46,753
Yeah.

363
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:38,152
- He did it.
- Is the AC responding?

364
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,438
- Yes.
- How long before the Sentox is neutralised?

365
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:46,196
At least 15 minutes. But it should stop
eating away at the seals immediately.

366
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:50,398
Polymer count is down. It looks like
the seals will hold until all zones are clear.

367
00:28:55,759 --> 00:29:00,197
Lynn, Harry, I don't know if you can still
hear me, but what you did was successful.

368
00:29:00,279 --> 00:29:02,510
<i>The seals are holding.</i>

369
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:09,119
<i>I will personally notify your families
and tell them of the sacrifice you made.</i>

370
00:29:09,199 --> 00:29:12,032
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

371
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:14,269
<i>I don't know what else to say.</i>

372
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:17,350
Thank you.

373
00:29:26,759 --> 00:29:29,033
I'm OK.

374
00:29:29,239 --> 00:29:31,468
I'm OK.

375
00:30:23,478 --> 00:30:26,275
Pull up the security feed to Medical.

376
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:44,749
Can you hear me? What's your name?

377
00:30:44,837 --> 00:30:46,714
No.

378
00:30:46,797 --> 00:30:48,515
No name.

379
00:30:48,597 --> 00:30:51,157
You're wasting your time.

380
00:30:51,236 --> 00:30:54,273
<i>It's Jack Bauer.
What have you got from Henderson?</i>

381
00:30:54,357 --> 00:30:56,472
Nothing. He's still not talking.

382
00:30:56,557 --> 00:31:01,584
<i>OK, keep working on him. As soon as
the barriers go up I'll get back to you.</i>

383
00:31:01,676 --> 00:31:04,395
Chloe, I don't think
we're gonna break Henderson.

384
00:31:04,476 --> 00:31:07,627
All we're gonna get is from his computer.
Keep working on it.

385
00:31:07,716 --> 00:31:12,426
- My team is gone. How am I gonna do that?
- Only work on his files.

386
00:31:12,516 --> 00:31:17,795
Kim. As soon as the barriers go up, I want you
to go to Medical and let them check you out.

387
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:22,631
- No. When the barriers go up, I'm leaving.
- Please do this for me. We still need to talk.

388
00:31:22,716 --> 00:31:24,752
There's nothing to talk about.

389
00:31:27,236 --> 00:31:30,033
- Don't be in such a hurry to cut me off.
- You cut me off.

390
00:31:30,116 --> 00:31:33,471
Listen to me, I'm not angry. I love you.

391
00:31:33,556 --> 00:31:38,709
But there's nothing left to say,
except I don't want to be around you.

392
00:31:39,756 --> 00:31:43,987
Every time I am,
something horrible happens. People die.

393
00:31:44,075 --> 00:31:46,953
And I know that's not your fault,

394
00:31:47,036 --> 00:31:49,026
but I can't be a part of it.

395
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:52,346
I don't want you to be a part of that.
All I want is for one day,

396
00:31:52,435 --> 00:31:56,314
you and I just to be able
to spend time together.

397
00:31:58,555 --> 00:32:02,070
Kim, I had to give you up once.
I'm not gonna let that happen again.

398
00:32:02,154 --> 00:32:03,270
Dad...

399
00:32:04,754 --> 00:32:06,666
I can't.

400
00:32:15,074 --> 00:32:16,427
- Hi.
- Hey.

401
00:32:17,714 --> 00:32:20,274
God, that was close.

402
00:32:33,074 --> 00:32:35,747
You all right?

403
00:32:35,834 --> 00:32:37,426
No.

404
00:32:52,314 --> 00:32:54,429
"An emergency peacekeeping force. "

405
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:57,983
That was Hal's suggestion. I think it works.

406
00:32:58,074 --> 00:33:00,746
Charles, aren't you afraid an edict of this kind

407
00:33:00,834 --> 00:33:06,032
could do far more damage
than any chemical weapon ever could?

408
00:33:06,113 --> 00:33:09,867
Martha, CTU has been attacked.
Our first line of defence is shut down.

409
00:33:09,953 --> 00:33:14,981
People were killed because of this weapon.
That's just a prelude to what's gonna happen.

410
00:33:15,073 --> 00:33:18,223
More nerve gas will be released.
I can guarantee it.

411
00:33:18,313 --> 00:33:21,510
Look, if you or Mike
have any better ideas, please.

412
00:33:21,592 --> 00:33:23,948
I would be glad to hear them.

413
00:33:28,152 --> 00:33:31,463
- Mike, could we have a moment?
- Certainly.

414
00:33:39,432 --> 00:33:41,707
What is it, Martha?

415
00:33:44,352 --> 00:33:47,549
If you, Charles Logan,

416
00:33:47,632 --> 00:33:53,423
really feel that martial law is your only option,
I will support you.

417
00:33:53,511 --> 00:33:56,868
But what I will not do is stand by

418
00:33:56,951 --> 00:34:00,422
and watch Hal Gardner use you
to promote his own agenda.

419
00:34:00,511 --> 00:34:03,584
- Please, give me some credit.
- He has done it before.

420
00:34:03,671 --> 00:34:06,186
He is not the president. You are.

421
00:34:06,271 --> 00:34:09,900
I'm doing this
because it's the right thing to do.

422
00:34:16,231 --> 00:34:19,268
I don't know
how much more of this I can take.

423
00:34:20,231 --> 00:34:22,461
I really don't.

424
00:34:29,831 --> 00:34:34,029
David's assassination,
the nerve gas, the murder of those hostages,

425
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:36,830
Walt Cummings' betrayal...

426
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:40,145
And you.

427
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:43,901
I almost lost you.

428
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:47,861
I didn't lose you, did I?

429
00:34:55,950 --> 00:34:57,986
No, Charles.

430
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:05,787
You didn't lose me.

431
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:08,827
I'm still here.

432
00:35:13,749 --> 00:35:16,582
<i>- Yes.
- We're set in position.</i>

433
00:35:16,669 --> 00:35:18,183
Good.

434
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:21,705
The men are there. They need the schematics.

435
00:35:36,669 --> 00:35:38,546
Who is it?

436
00:35:38,629 --> 00:35:41,018
Just a client.

437
00:35:41,868 --> 00:35:44,667
- Yes?
- Have you got it yet?

438
00:35:44,748 --> 00:35:48,821
I told you I'd call you as soon as I have
everything. I'm still waiting on a few items.

439
00:35:48,908 --> 00:35:51,901
I'm paying you a lot of money, Collette.

440
00:35:51,989 --> 00:35:57,347
If you could've got the specs of a facility this
secure from someone else, you would have.

441
00:35:57,428 --> 00:36:02,138
But you didn't. You called me,
and I'll have it for you in a few minutes.

442
00:36:06,228 --> 00:36:08,901
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

443
00:36:08,988 --> 00:36:10,944
Difficult client.

444
00:36:13,188 --> 00:36:17,579
I wish I knew exactly what it is you did.
I might be able to help.

445
00:36:17,667 --> 00:36:19,898
You do help me.

446
00:36:20,987 --> 00:36:23,548
Oh... I can't.

447
00:36:23,628 --> 00:36:26,665
I have to go and finish something.

448
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:33,457
Finish this.

449
00:36:36,227 --> 00:36:39,026
<i>- How long until the air's safe?
- Momentarily.</i>

450
00:36:39,107 --> 00:36:41,985
All right, thank you very much.

451
00:36:42,068 --> 00:36:43,546
Buchanan.

452
00:36:43,627 --> 00:36:46,266
- Karen Hayes from Homeland Security.
- Karen.

453
00:36:46,347 --> 00:36:49,225
I'm running a damage assessment.
I need your body count.

454
00:36:49,307 --> 00:36:53,346
We don't have one yet. We'll know more
when CRT gets here and the barriers lift.

455
00:36:53,427 --> 00:36:55,622
What's your best estimate?

456
00:36:55,707 --> 00:37:00,018
I'm guessing we'll need at least 20 in Comm,
35 in Tactical and other departments.

457
00:37:00,107 --> 00:37:04,385
I'm on my way over there with a core team.
We can make adjustments when I get there.

458
00:37:04,466 --> 00:37:06,900
- You're coming here now?
- Yes.

459
00:37:08,066 --> 00:37:10,422
<i>- I see.
- I'll be there soon.</i>

460
00:37:10,506 --> 00:37:14,818
- How's your progress?
- Good. I've reformatted their main servers.

461
00:37:14,906 --> 00:37:17,545
All tactical protocols
will have to go through me.

462
00:37:17,626 --> 00:37:21,221
I may have to replace some personnel
with my people. Is that a problem?

463
00:37:21,306 --> 00:37:25,936
Absolutely not. After what they've been
through, most won't be up to full capacity.

464
00:37:26,026 --> 00:37:29,257
We need to identify these people quickly
and send them home.

465
00:37:29,346 --> 00:37:33,054
Will I need approval from Bill Buchanan
to make a personnel change?

466
00:37:33,146 --> 00:37:35,979
No, Bill won't be in charge when we get there.

467
00:37:36,066 --> 00:37:37,783
I will.

468
00:37:37,866 --> 00:37:42,894
For all intents and purposes,
CTU is no longer an operational entity.

469
00:37:42,985 --> 00:37:46,978
It's a building with workers
who will report to us.

470
00:37:51,385 --> 00:37:54,104
We're clear. I'm going back to Medical.

471
00:37:55,145 --> 00:37:57,181
Kim.

472
00:37:57,265 --> 00:38:00,302
- I have to finish this now.
- I know.

473
00:38:00,385 --> 00:38:02,740
Goodbye, Dad.

474
00:38:04,505 --> 00:38:05,654
Yeah.

475
00:38:09,305 --> 00:38:11,261
Goodbye.

476
00:38:13,225 --> 00:38:15,022
Excuse me, Jack.

477
00:38:15,585 --> 00:38:19,703
I just wanted to say thank you
for saving our lives.

478
00:38:19,784 --> 00:38:23,174
We definitely couldn't have
gotten through this without you.

479
00:38:23,265 --> 00:38:29,134
Take her outside of this city.
Don't make any stops. You understand?

480
00:38:43,784 --> 00:38:47,743
- Looks like he's dead.
- No. His nervous system is shut down.

481
00:38:47,824 --> 00:38:50,621
- Well, can you wake him up?
- No.

482
00:38:57,103 --> 00:39:00,379
- Almeida.
- Tony, it's Jack. I'm on my way.

483
00:39:00,943 --> 00:39:04,823
Yeah, Jack. Henderson's in a coma.
He's not coming out of it.

484
00:39:04,903 --> 00:39:07,542
You've had your chance. He's mine now.

485
00:39:07,623 --> 00:39:11,775
- Dammit, Tony, just wait until I get there.
- No. I'm done waiting.

486
00:39:11,863 --> 00:39:14,457
<i>Don't do this. It won't bring back Michelle.</i>

487
00:39:14,543 --> 00:39:17,341
No. But I'll feel better.

488
00:39:17,423 --> 00:39:19,254
<i>Trust me, you won't.</i>

489
00:39:21,303 --> 00:39:24,022
You're probably right. I'll let you know.

490
00:39:24,103 --> 00:39:25,502
Tony!

491
00:39:25,582 --> 00:39:27,892
Tony! Dammit.

492
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:30,773
What'd Jack say?

493
00:39:30,863 --> 00:39:35,060
He's on his way here.
We'll figure out what to do when he gets here.

494
00:39:35,143 --> 00:39:37,372
There's nothing to figure out.

495
00:39:37,463 --> 00:39:39,453
This guy's cooked.

496
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:49,057
Tony! Tony!

497
00:40:49,901 --> 00:40:52,414
I... couldn't do it.

498
00:40:52,501 --> 00:40:56,049
It's all right. It's all right.
Come on. Come on.

499
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:00,693
Stay with me. Stay with me.

500
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:04,489
I need help! Somebody help!

501
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:09,777
No, no. No. Hang on.

502
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:11,088
Hang on.

503
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:14,694
She's gone, Jack.
