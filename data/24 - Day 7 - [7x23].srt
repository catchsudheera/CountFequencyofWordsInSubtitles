[Jack Bauer]
Previously on 24.

2
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:22,121
TheJustice Department is investigating
theJonas Hodges car bombing.

3
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:26,484
I changed my mind.
I didn't transfer the funds.

4
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,256
Why would he go ahead
and kill Hodges if he wasn't paid?

5
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:31,797
Because it's what you wanted. Am I right?

6
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:34,834
Jack, I unlocked Tony's location data.

7
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:39,528
[Jack]
Okay, we've got him.

8
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:46,478
Where's the canister?

9
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:49,606
I am not gonna stop
until you tell me where it is.

10
00:00:57,758 --> 00:00:59,555
- Jack.
- It's all right. It's all right.

11
00:00:59,626 --> 00:01:02,060
- You need to give yourself a shot.
- I already did, 20 minutes ago.

12
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:05,587
- It's not working.
- You heading home?

13
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:07,997
- Yeah.
- Us too.

14
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:10,459
[Cell Phone Ringing]

15
00:01:10,537 --> 00:01:13,233
- This is Bauer.
- I'm sending a link to your phone.

16
00:01:13,306 --> 00:01:15,001
It's something I think you should see.

17
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:17,873
Your daughter's in the company
of our operatives.

18
00:01:17,944 --> 00:01:20,344
Put this call on your earpiece
and keep the line open.

19
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:22,574
I'm gonna be listening to everything you say.

20
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:26,107
You will help Tony Almeida escape,
or my people will murder your daughter.

21
00:01:28,722 --> 00:01:33,352
[Jack Bauer] The following takes place
between 6:;00 a.m. And 7:;00 a.m.

22
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,892
Okay. Thank you.

23
00:01:35,962 --> 00:01:38,487
The Deputy Attorney General
is ready for you, ma'am.

24
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:45,597
TelePresence call is initiated.

25
00:01:45,672 --> 00:01:47,537
Network is secure. Go ahead.

26
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:50,701
Good morning, Ms. Taylor. Thank you for
giving up your time for this investigation.

27
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:52,711
Of course.

28
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:55,577
Mrs. Rollins, Mr. Hock
are from theJustice Department.

29
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:58,015
They'll be conducting your interview.

30
00:01:58,084 --> 00:02:01,542
Let the record show that this is to be
the testimony of Olivia Taylor...

31
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:03,748
acting White House chief of staff...

32
00:02:03,824 --> 00:02:07,089
regarding the homicide
of federal witness Jonas Hodges.

33
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:10,891
Let it also show that I am present to ensure
that strict protocols be followed...

34
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,898
for Ms. Taylor's protection.

35
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:15,992
- Why would I need protecting?
- Uh, poor choice of words.

36
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:19,766
I merely meant that your questioning
is just a formality.

37
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,401
We have to go through everyone
who had knowledge of Hodges's
whereabouts until the bombing.

38
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:25,410
I see.

39
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:28,777
Mrs. Rollins,
you have the floor. Let's begin.

40
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:33,842
[Chattering]

41
00:02:36,022 --> 00:02:38,149
I wanted Olivia in this briefiing.
Where is she?

42
00:02:38,225 --> 00:02:40,989
I'm sorry, ma'am, but she's tied up
with the Deputy A.G. And investigators...

43
00:02:41,061 --> 00:02:42,722
Iooking into the Hodges murder.

44
00:02:42,796 --> 00:02:46,732
- Have they made any progress
on who leaked Hodges's location?
- Not yet.

45
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,964
But they agree that the list of people
who knew Hodges was alive and at F.B.I. Is short.

46
00:02:51,037 --> 00:02:53,733
The leak had to come from inside.

47
00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:59,034
- Good morning, everyone.
- Good morning, Madam President.

48
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:02,104
- Madam President.
- Please take your seats.

49
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:07,248
I realize that we are all
in dire need of sleep...

50
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,686
but I felt that it was vital...

51
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:12,953
to bring you all up to speed on the events
of the past few hours...

52
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:16,484
and a greater crisis we face
on the horizon.

53
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:20,021
Less than 30 minutes ago,
the F.B.I. Managed to recover...

54
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:23,001
the last canister of the bioweapon.

55
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:26,300
But I'm afraid that the danger
is far from over.

56
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:30,139
Before his death, Jonas Hodges told us...

57
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:34,647
that there were other parties involved with him
in the creation of this bioweapon-

58
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:39,617
a highly secret and extremely powerful group
of private military fiirms...

59
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:43,019
collaborating to undermine
the government of this country.

60
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:45,023
Excuse me, Madam President...

61
00:03:45,091 --> 00:03:47,651
but which military fiirms
are we talking about?

62
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:49,388
We don't know, Admiral.

63
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:53,899
Hodges gave us no names
or idea of which companies are involved...

64
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:59,530
but whoever they are, they represent
a very real and ongoing threat.

65
00:04:01,141 --> 00:04:05,077
Now, we don't have much
actionable intelligence at this point.

66
00:04:05,145 --> 00:04:10,014
However, the F.B.I. Has apprehended
former C.T.U. Operative Tony Almeida.

67
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,176
He is a key fiigure in this plot...

68
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:16,882
someone we hope will be able
to help us uncover who these people are.

69
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:21,817
Agent Walker, this is air support Bravo 3.

70
00:04:21,895 --> 00:04:25,387
- We're in position. Your convoy's in sight.
- Roger that, Bravo 3.

71
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:29,401
Metro will be controlling traffiic and setting up
a secure corridor through downtown.

72
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:32,666
We'll be bringing Almeida in to headquarters
through the west entrance.

73
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:35,606
[Cara On Earpiece]
It's almost time, Mr. Bauer.

74
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:38,405
The convoy you're traveling with
is about to get off on the l-70.

75
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:40,708
You'll need to break off
before you reach the downtown exit...

76
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,943
or you'll lose your chance
to facilitate an escape for Tony.

77
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:47,077
For your daughter's sake...

78
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:49,348
you don't want that to happen.

79
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,355
Now listen carefully.

80
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:54,359
You'll need to commandeer the van...

81
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:57,294
and peel onto the Taft Street exit
in about four miles.

82
00:04:57,364 --> 00:05:00,800
I'll direct you further
once you've managed this.

83
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:04,633
Remember, my operatives
are with your daughter.

84
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:08,936
In fact, I'm looking at her right now,
so don't try to be a hero.

Something wrong?

87
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:29,220
It's starting to look like the flight
is gonna be full. And I'm on standby.

88
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:32,628
Oh, no, you're gonna get on. There have to be
some people that are too spooked to fly...

89
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:34,223
after those planes went down yesterday.

90
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,598
Bob, did you have to bring that up?

91

could sit down, please?

hit you getting out of the cab.

- What is it?
- I'm getting worried.

101
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:42,526
It's only a matter of time
before that F.B.I. Agent's body's discovered...

102
00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:44,900
and I think Bauer's daughter
is getting suspicious.

103
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:48,202
Look, I gave Bauer a short window
to deliver Tony to me.

104
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:51,072
It won't be long.
Just stand by until you hear from me.

And what if Kim Bauer
makes us before then?

You can't allow yourselves to be taken.
Do what you have to do.

- Jack, why?
- They've got my daughter.

127
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:55,323
That's not possible. I deployed Agent Franks
to watch over her like you asked.

128

Agent Franks is dead. The people that are working
with Tony have operatives with Kim right now.

I don't trust Tony to let her go.

Please, I am begging you,
do whatever you have to to save her. Please.

What are you bringing Bauer for?

156
00:10:59,726 --> 00:11:03,162
Tony, I've done everything you've asked.
Just let Kim go.

157
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:05,390
- Let her go!
- Get in the car.

158
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:10,159
So what are you doing, Tony?
We don't need a hostage, okay, especially not him.

159
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:11,897
Shoot him already, and let's get out of here.

You're not seeing the big picture, Cara.
Your people are gonna be able...

00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,972
to launch their biological attacks
just as they originally planned.

We don't have the pathogen anymore.

The pathogen's in his blood.
It's in his organs.

00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:30,088
We'll be able to harvest
everything we need from his body.

00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:33,751
Why do you think I had you
put those operatives on Kim Bauer?

thatJack's viable.

Take a moment to look that over.

173
00:12:04,042 --> 00:12:06,704
- Thank you again for coming.
- You can thank me, Agent Pierce...

174
00:12:06,778 --> 00:12:08,712
by telling me what this is all about.

175
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:11,305
All right, sir,
but we don't have much time.

176
00:12:11,382 --> 00:12:14,317
- You implied it had something
to do with Olivia Taylor.
- Yes, sir.

177
00:12:14,385 --> 00:12:18,549
A few hours ago, Jonas Hodges
was killed outside F.B.I. Headquarters.

178
00:12:18,623 --> 00:12:20,557
My God.

179
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:24,493
Now, authorities believe he was murdered
to keep him from implicating others...

180
00:12:24,562 --> 00:12:28,054
who were involved
in the bioweapon attacks...

181
00:12:28,132 --> 00:12:30,225
but I suspect
there may be another scenario...

182
00:12:30,301 --> 00:12:34,203
and I have reason to believe
that Ms. Taylor might be involved.

183
00:12:35,707 --> 00:12:39,541
That is an outrageous accusation,
Agent Pierce.

184
00:12:39,611 --> 00:12:42,011
Olivia is capable of many things...

185
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,640
but I can't believe
committing murder is one of them.

186
00:12:44,716 --> 00:12:46,650
Mr. Kanin, please just hear me out.

187
00:12:46,718 --> 00:12:50,381
After the president agreed
to a witness protection deal for Hodges...

188
00:12:50,455 --> 00:12:52,889
Ms. Taylor made a comment to me...

189
00:12:52,957 --> 00:12:54,925
about wanting to see Hodges dead.

190
00:12:54,993 --> 00:12:58,190
He was responsible for her brother's death.
She was venting.

191
00:12:58,262 --> 00:13:00,127
I thought so too...

192
00:13:00,198 --> 00:13:04,430
until she met in her offiice with an old colleague
of hers, a man named Martin Collier.

193
00:13:04,502 --> 00:13:07,767
- I know Collier.
- Then you know the sort of man he is.

194
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:11,570
I do, but none of this
constitutes proof of complicity.

195
00:13:11,643 --> 00:13:15,010
No, sir. That's why I need you to access
the digital recording system-

196
00:13:15,079 --> 00:13:19,516
to see if their conversation was recorded.

197
00:13:19,584 --> 00:13:22,553
Agent, you're asking me to break into an offiice
that's no longer mine...

198
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:26,852
and access classifiied recordings
of the acting chief of staff.

199
00:13:26,924 --> 00:13:30,621
Mr. Kanin, if my suspicions
prove correct...

200
00:13:30,695 --> 00:13:34,426
you, of all people, understand how grave
these consequences would be.

201
00:13:34,499 --> 00:13:39,232
Sir, Ms. Taylor's behavior over the past
several hours has been erratic at best.

202
00:13:39,303 --> 00:13:43,239
Now, she's with theJustice Department
investigators now, and we don't have much time.

203

If you could just again review
the records on the screen below, Ms. Taylor...

00:20:22,106 --> 00:20:24,506
He was killed by the people
following you. Listen, Kim.

300
00:20:24,575 --> 00:20:27,135
Whoever these operatives are,
they're in close proximity to you.

301
00:20:27,211 --> 00:20:30,840
Your father told me they sent him
a live feed to prove they had you in their sights.

302
00:20:30,915 --> 00:20:33,884
Have you noticed anyone
with a camera or cell phone?

303
00:20:34,952 --> 00:20:37,182
- Or a laptop?
- What?

304
00:20:37,254 --> 00:20:40,189
There's a couple that I've been talking to.
They're sitting right next to me.

305
00:20:40,257 --> 00:20:42,282
The man has an open laptop
right in front of me.

306
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:46,193
- Can you give me a description?
- Yeah. He's got long hair, he's tall-

307
00:20:48,132 --> 00:20:52,000
- Kim? Kim, what's wrong?
- Oh, well, I appreciate that. Okay. Thank you.

308
00:20:52,069 --> 00:20:55,368
Please let baggage claim know that
I will be much more careful next time.

309
00:20:55,439 --> 00:20:57,373
Kim?

310
00:20:57,441 --> 00:20:59,534
- Chloe, do you read me?
- I'm here.

311
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:03,842
The operatives may be moving on Kim. Alert
airport police. Have them lock down the terminal.

312
00:21:03,914 --> 00:21:06,849
Tell airport security to maintain patrols.
Do nothing to arouse suspicion.

313
00:21:06,917 --> 00:21:08,475
Okay.

314
00:21:08,552 --> 00:21:10,349
Okay. Bye.

315
00:21:10,421 --> 00:21:13,720
We saw you were on the phone. We thought
there might be a problem. You need some help?

316
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:16,419
No. There's no problem.
I left my electric toothbrush on in my luggage.

317
00:21:16,494 --> 00:21:18,860
So the airline called
and said they broke my lock.

318
00:21:18,929 --> 00:21:22,194
- Nice. You get your boarding pass?
- Oh, yeah. It's right here.

319
00:21:27,771 --> 00:21:31,502
There was a little security problem
with her luggage.

320
00:21:31,575 --> 00:21:35,170
[Kim]
Guess they can never be too careful.

321
00:21:45,523 --> 00:21:48,788
- You okay?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm fiine.

322
00:21:48,859 --> 00:21:52,056
This is the fiirst time
that I've been apart from my little girl.

323
00:21:52,129 --> 00:21:56,361
I'm just a little anxious
to get back to see her.

324
00:21:56,433 --> 00:22:00,369
- Would you like to see a picture of her?
- Sure.

325
00:22:01,539 --> 00:22:04,235
Got one in here.

326
00:22:04,308 --> 00:22:06,299
Here it is.

327
00:22:06,377 --> 00:22:08,607
Yeah.

328
00:22:08,679 --> 00:22:10,840
Where is... Here. Yeah.

329
00:22:10,915 --> 00:22:14,112
- Her name's Teri.
- She's adorable.

330
00:22:14,185 --> 00:22:17,985
Thank you.
Look at this. So cute.

331
00:22:20,291 --> 00:22:22,555
That's my husband, actually.

332
00:22:24,295 --> 00:22:26,354

It's Kim Bauer. Security's down.
Where are the airport police?

342
00:23:37,768 --> 00:23:39,827
They're mobilizing to you now.
What about the operatives?

343
00:23:39,903 --> 00:23:41,734
The woman is dead.
The man is getting away.

344
00:23:41,805 --> 00:23:43,796
Kim, we need him to fiind your father.

Olivia.

352
00:24:20,593 --> 00:24:22,788
I always liked that about you, Ethan.

353
00:24:22,862 --> 00:24:26,025
Even when I was a little girl, you always
stood up when I came into the room.

354
00:24:26,099 --> 00:24:28,090
Old habits die hard.

355
00:24:28,168 --> 00:24:30,432
You removed something from my offiice.

356
00:24:30,503 --> 00:24:34,132
- I want it back.
- I told you before, you're welcome to them.

357
00:24:34,207 --> 00:24:38,473
- You know damn well
I'm not talking about those fiiles.
- Do I?

358
00:24:38,545 --> 00:24:41,446
Ethan, I found the digital recorder.

359
00:24:41,514 --> 00:24:44,278
Now give me what you took...

360
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:47,842
or I'll order the security offiicers
outside this door to strip-search you.

361
00:24:50,256 --> 00:24:52,724
All right. I do have a recording.

362
00:24:52,792 --> 00:24:57,229
It's a personal account of my last days
in service to this administration...

363
00:24:57,297 --> 00:24:59,424
and I think I'm entitled to it.

364
00:24:59,499 --> 00:25:02,900
No one is entitled to take sensitive
material out of the White House.

365
00:25:02,969 --> 00:25:04,903
Oh...

366
00:25:04,971 --> 00:25:08,566
now it's national security
you're worried about.

367
00:25:09,809 --> 00:25:11,902
As a matter of fact, yes.

368
00:25:13,112 --> 00:25:15,046
Well, I still have my clearances.

369
00:25:15,114 --> 00:25:17,514
Why don't we listen
to the recording together?

370
00:25:17,584 --> 00:25:20,985
You're in no position
to dictate terms, Ethan.

371
00:25:21,054 --> 00:25:23,989
You're in violation
of at least 10 federal laws.

372
00:25:24,057 --> 00:25:26,821
What are you so afraid of, Olivia?

373
00:25:26,893 --> 00:25:28,918
What's on there that's so incriminating?

374
00:25:30,163 --> 00:25:32,393
I'm not the one facing incrimination.

375
00:25:32,465 --> 00:25:34,330
You are.

376
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,267
But give me the recording right now...

377
00:25:37,337 --> 00:25:40,568
and I'll see to it no charges are fiiled.

378
00:25:43,743 --> 00:25:45,802
Last chance, Ethan.

379
00:25:55,355 --> 00:25:57,380
Search him for a data card.

380
00:25:57,457 --> 00:26:00,290
I'm being held without cause.
I demand to speak to President Taylor.

381
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:03,022
It was the president
who ordered his detention.

382
00:26:03,096 --> 00:26:06,156
If that's true,
I want to hear it from her directly.

383
00:26:07,233 --> 00:26:09,531
Well, this is a criminal matter now.

384
00:26:09,602 --> 00:26:13,368
Considering her personal relationship
with Mr. Kanin...

385
00:26:13,439 --> 00:26:17,341
the president doesn't deem it appropriate
to intrude on the investigation.

386
00:26:19,145 --> 00:26:21,136
Please stand up, Mr. Kanin.

387

You're making a terrible mistake.

389
00:26:28,621 --> 00:26:32,182
Ms. Taylor is grossly
overstepping her authority.

May I ask
what was on the other data card?

402

Nothing. It's blank.

I can try to get you into the communications
offiice so you can listen to that.

- It depends.
- On what?

On the levels of pathogen
in his spinal fluid.

in the same room together. I'll sell myself.

- I don't think that would be the right approach.
- Why not?

434
00:30:48,814 --> 00:30:50,782
Because he's careful to a fault, Tony...

435
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:53,819
and he's very protective of his anonymity.

But the bottom line is,
without me this operation never happens.

438

Now, you have influence over him.

He trusts you. You can convince him.
I've seen you do it before.

Worst case, he has a suspicion.

to listen to the recording, did he?

- No.
- Okay.

you destroyed the data card, right?

involving Tony Almeida.

You're hurt. Let me see your arm.

493
00:36:17,938 --> 00:36:21,465
No, listen to me, Renee. That laptop
has the camera they were using to track me.

494
00:36:21,542 --> 00:36:23,476
With a D-11 inverse router...

495

we may be able to backtrace the signal

Is there anyone back at your offiice
that can help us with this?

[Olivia] I don't need a lecture
on conscience from you, of all people.

506
00:37:36,709 --> 00:37:39,803
I have thought this through.

507
00:37:39,879 --> 00:37:43,315
What I can't live with is that monster
getting away with this.

508
00:37:43,383 --> 00:37:46,352
He has to pay for what he did.

509
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:53,257
The virus load is even higher
than we hoped for.

510
00:37:53,326 --> 00:37:55,419
Ten-plus in spinal fluid alone.

511
00:37:55,495 --> 00:37:58,157
Not enough to reconstitute
the pathogen, of course.

512
00:37:58,231 --> 00:38:00,927
We'll still need his organs for that.

513
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,525
He doesn't look too good.

514
00:38:03,603 --> 00:38:05,833
How much longer does he have?

515
00:38:07,206 --> 00:38:09,436
Couple of hours, give or take.

516
00:38:13,746 --> 00:38:17,113
And what happens if he dies
before we extract the pathogen?

517
00:38:17,183 --> 00:38:19,378
Obviously, it's optimal
to keep the host alive...

518
00:38:19,452 --> 00:38:23,411
but the pathogen can survive up to two hours
after death, sometimes even longer.

519
00:38:23,489 --> 00:38:25,252
In fact, the only sure way to destroy it...

520
00:38:25,325 --> 00:38:28,817
is by exposure to extreme temperatures
above 500 degrees Celsius.

521
00:38:29,896 --> 00:38:32,330
Make sure you put that in your report.

522
00:38:32,398 --> 00:38:35,367
I have. And I've already
uploaded it to your computer.

523
00:38:35,435 --> 00:38:38,768
Good. Get him ready to move.

524
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:42,865
Get the stretcher.

525
00:38:42,942 --> 00:38:45,809
Bauer is viable,
but you'll need to secure a facility.

526
00:38:45,878 --> 00:38:51,043
That won't be a problem as long as you're
absolutely certain that we can accomplish this.

527
00:38:51,117 --> 00:38:53,244
We've already done the hard part, Alan.

528
00:38:53,319 --> 00:38:56,254
And from what I understand,
with the proper equipment...

529
00:38:56,322 --> 00:38:59,257
the actual extraction and bioengineering
is fairly straightforward.

530
00:38:59,325 --> 00:39:02,852
Okay, Cara.
I'll contact the others. Good work.

531
00:39:02,929 --> 00:39:05,830
They should know they have
Almeida to thank for this.

532
00:39:05,898 --> 00:39:10,028
- He's the one who realized Bauer
was a possible source.
- Relay my gratitude.

533
00:39:10,103 --> 00:39:12,503
I think you should consider
going farther than that.

534
00:39:12,572 --> 00:39:15,006
"Farther"? What did you have in mind?

535
00:39:17,744 --> 00:39:19,905
Tony believes in what we're doing.

536
00:39:19,979 --> 00:39:22,106
He wants to play a larger role.

537
00:39:23,583 --> 00:39:25,517
That sounds premature to me.

538
00:39:25,585 --> 00:39:29,521
The thing is, Alan,
if we don't make a signifiicant gesture...

539
00:39:29,589 --> 00:39:31,523
I'm afraid we may lose him.

540
00:39:31,591 --> 00:39:33,786
I don't even know this man, Cara.

541
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:36,920
Then you should get to know him.

542
00:39:36,996 --> 00:39:40,591
Are you suggesting I meet with him?

543
00:39:40,667 --> 00:39:45,604
Look, all I'm saying is that he would be
a very useful voice in the mix.

544
00:39:45,672 --> 00:39:50,439
His fiield experience fiills a knowledge gap
in regards to our logistics and planning.

545
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:53,445
Coming from you,
that's a hell of a recommendation.

546
00:39:53,513 --> 00:39:55,242
There's no one better, Alan.

547
00:39:55,314 --> 00:39:58,249
And it's not as if you haven't vetted
every other member of the group.

548
00:39:58,317 --> 00:40:02,151
Maybe it is time that he and I met.

549
00:40:02,221 --> 00:40:07,716
I could be there, where you are,
in the next half hour.

550
00:40:08,861 --> 00:40:10,795
You're coming here?

551
00:40:10,863 --> 00:40:14,390
I think it would be a good idea
if I supervised Bauer's transfer myself...

552
00:40:14,467 --> 00:40:16,594
Make the others feel at ease,
don't you think?

553
00:40:16,669 --> 00:40:19,297
But, Cara,
I'll look Almeida in the eye...

554
00:40:19,372 --> 00:40:22,967
and if for any reason
I don't like what I see-

I can't let him walk
out of that meeting alive.

00:40:30,116 --> 00:40:32,107
I understand.

He'll be here in a little while.
