1
00:00:14,749 --> 00:00:17,138
When I have it, we have to involve your father.

2
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:21,541
You know I don't like to be kept in the dark.
Tell me what this is all about.

3
00:00:21,629 --> 00:00:23,381
I will. I just need a minute.

4
00:00:23,469 --> 00:00:25,779
<i>I decide what needs to be done.</i>

5
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:28,543
<i>I never authorised you to kill David Palmer.</i>

6
00:00:28,631 --> 00:00:31,145
- President Logan?
- And Christopher Henderson.

7
00:00:31,511 --> 00:00:33,786
I know what you did and what you're doing.

8
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:35,543
And I'm here to put an end to it.

9
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:37,781
- You asked to see me, Mr. President?
- Hal.

10
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:41,990
I'm asking Secretary Heller to tender his
resignation. I wanted you here as a witness.

11
00:00:42,072 --> 00:00:46,064
- What?
- He thinks I was complicit in today's attacks.

12
00:00:46,471 --> 00:00:47,905
Miles set me up.

13
00:00:47,991 --> 00:00:49,311
Please come with us.

14
00:00:49,392 --> 00:00:52,703
We traced your call
to a public phone at Van Nuys airport.

15
00:00:52,792 --> 00:00:55,513
If Audrey is at that location,
you're in a lot of trouble.

16
00:00:59,273 --> 00:01:03,267
You're supposed to be in custody.
You helped Audrey break surveillance.

17
00:01:03,353 --> 00:01:07,984
You need help. If you try to stop me, I will
recommend you for psychiatric evaluation.

18
00:01:08,075 --> 00:01:10,349
Get in here.

19
00:01:10,434 --> 00:01:12,994
- I couldn't contact Jack or Audrey.
- I haven't either.

20
00:01:13,354 --> 00:01:16,347
Whatever you tell me will remain between us,

21
00:01:16,435 --> 00:01:18,187
I promise you.

22
00:01:18,276 --> 00:01:19,265
Not here.

23
00:01:19,356 --> 00:01:21,187
Outside the south stable.

24
00:01:21,276 --> 00:01:24,187
<i>- Is Bauer dead?
- Not yet, Mr. President.</i>

25
00:01:24,276 --> 00:01:25,914
- He has the recording?
- Yes, sir.

26
00:01:25,995 --> 00:01:30,228
That evidence directly implicates me
in David Palmer's death.

27
00:01:30,717 --> 00:01:31,786
Son of a bitch.

28
00:01:31,876 --> 00:01:34,311
- What's going on?
- They want the recording.

29
00:01:43,558 --> 00:01:44,673
Audrey!

30
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:47,351
I have her, Jack.

31
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:50,908
What have you done?
- The left brachial artery.

32
00:01:50,998 --> 00:01:54,514
She has three minutes before
she bleeds to death. Throw me that recording.

33
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:56,510
Jack, don't do it.

34
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,190
She's running out of time!

35
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,874
Don't give it to him.
- Here it is!

36
00:02:10,241 --> 00:02:12,356
Easy. Easy. Easy.

37
00:02:12,441 --> 00:02:14,079
- Stay with me.
- Jack, go get it.

38
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,072
Stay with me.

39
00:02:24,482 --> 00:02:29,511
I need to loosen the tourniquet.

40
00:02:29,603 --> 00:02:33,073
The bleeding's stopped.
He didn't sever the brachial artery.

41
00:02:33,163 --> 00:02:36,633
- I need to get you to a doctor.
- I can wait. Do what you have to do.

42
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:38,441
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

43
00:02:38,523 --> 00:02:40,320
Keep your arm elevated.

44
00:02:44,484 --> 00:02:46,919
<i>This is Chloe O'Brian. I'm not available now.</i>

45
00:02:47,005 --> 00:02:48,801
Chloe's not picking up her phone.

46
00:02:48,884 --> 00:02:51,114
Can anyone else help you track Henderson?

47
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:54,083
No one who has access
to CTU's satellite network.

48
00:02:54,165 --> 00:02:56,474
- I'm so sorry. This is my fault.
- Stop it.

49
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:01,840
I'll be right back.

50
00:03:13,767 --> 00:03:15,962
- This is Jack Bauer.
- Jack?

51
00:03:16,047 --> 00:03:18,117
Why are you
answering Wexler's phone?

52
00:03:18,207 --> 00:03:21,883
He's dead. Henderson and a commando unit
attacked us 15 minutes ago.

53
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:23,799
They took the recording back.

54
00:03:23,888 --> 00:03:25,924
Is Audrey all right?

55
00:03:26,007 --> 00:03:28,647
She's fine. Did you cut your deal with Logan?

56
00:03:28,729 --> 00:03:30,959
Logan accepted my terms,

57
00:03:31,049 --> 00:03:33,961
then he took a call
and suddenly changed his mind.

58
00:03:34,049 --> 00:03:35,688
That must've been Henderson.

59
00:03:35,769 --> 00:03:40,047
We have to get the recording back.
If there's anything I can do, let me know.

60
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:44,169
With all due respect, Mr. Secretary,
I asked you for help, and you betrayed me.

61
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:47,402
Jack, I did what I thought
was best for this country.

62
00:03:47,891 --> 00:03:50,563
I made a mistake. Please, forgive me.

63
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:53,324
I need to go, sir.

64
00:03:59,452 --> 00:04:00,407
Come on.

65
00:04:04,332 --> 00:04:05,651
<i>- Hello?
- It's Jack.</i>

66
00:04:05,732 --> 00:04:08,883
Jack, did you get the recording
to Secretary Heller?

67
00:04:08,972 --> 00:04:13,126
Henderson's got the recording.
I need Chloe to find him, but I can't reach her.

68
00:04:13,213 --> 00:04:17,889
Chloe's here. She was arrested by Homeland
Security for helping you, but she got away.

69
00:04:17,974 --> 00:04:20,363
Put her on speaker.

70
00:04:20,454 --> 00:04:23,128
- Where are you?
- I'm at Van Nuys airfield. Listen.

71
00:04:23,214 --> 00:04:26,730
Henderson left here
ten minutes ago with the recording.

72
00:04:26,815 --> 00:04:30,171
I need you to access CTU's
satellite data streams to find him.

73
00:04:30,254 --> 00:04:33,247
If I log onto their system,
they'll find me eventually.

74
00:04:33,335 --> 00:04:35,804
You don't need to track him for long.
Can you do it?

75
00:04:35,896 --> 00:04:38,968
- I can try to slip in through the subnet.
- Get back to me.

76
00:04:39,056 --> 00:04:43,732
<i>I'll set up a VPN pathway so they can't
trace us. It will only work with that phone.</i>

77
00:04:43,816 --> 00:04:45,136
OK.

78
00:04:45,216 --> 00:04:47,684
I got ahold of Chloe.
We need to go. Can you get up?

79
00:04:47,776 --> 00:04:49,609
- Yeah.
- Move slowly.

80
00:04:49,697 --> 00:04:51,494
Ow.

81
00:04:52,937 --> 00:04:54,529
Come on.

82
00:04:54,618 --> 00:04:57,337
For satellite tracking,
I need more than my laptop.

83
00:04:57,417 --> 00:05:00,854
I'll network onto your computer,
even though it's pathetic.

84
00:05:00,938 --> 00:05:03,453
- And get that screen to work for me.
- All right.

85
00:05:03,538 --> 00:05:06,336
I hope you don't mind,
but I don't work for you now.

86
00:05:06,418 --> 00:05:09,012
- It's all right, Chloe.
- Good.

87
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,049
Bauer.

88
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:22,689
Jack, I'm pulling up footage of the airfield
from 15 minutes ago.

89
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,534
- Look for an explosion in the northwest.
- I see it.

90
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:28,738
Five minutes later, a vehicle leaves.
That's Henderson.

91
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:32,780
He went south on the service drive
and east on Menders. Then I lose him.

92
00:05:32,861 --> 00:05:35,581
Use another satellite, traffic cams. Find him.

93
00:05:35,661 --> 00:05:37,971
It'll take us a few minutes, but we're on it.

94
00:05:38,062 --> 00:05:42,852
Copy that. Get back to me
as soon as you've got him on a live feed.

95
00:05:57,743 --> 00:06:01,373
What makes you think that Henderson
hasn't destroyed the recording?

96
00:06:01,464 --> 00:06:05,855
He would've done it in front of me,
giving me less of a reason to come after him.

97
00:06:05,945 --> 00:06:10,062
- Why would he keep it?
- It's his insurance.

98
00:06:14,866 --> 00:06:16,858
- Yes?
- Is Bauer dead?

99
00:06:16,946 --> 00:06:19,221
<i>- No.
- What happened?</i>

100
00:06:19,305 --> 00:06:24,016
- All that matters is that I have the recording.
- Have you destroyed it?

101
00:06:24,106 --> 00:06:26,985
- No, sir, I have not.
- Why? What's the problem?

102
00:06:27,067 --> 00:06:29,502
I'm making sure there won't be any problems.

103
00:06:29,587 --> 00:06:31,019
I don't understand.

104
00:06:31,107 --> 00:06:34,019
I may need protection.
That recording gives it to me.

105
00:06:34,107 --> 00:06:36,542
<i>- Protection?
- Yes, sir.</i>

106
00:06:36,628 --> 00:06:40,508
Do you mean from me? That's absurd.

107
00:06:40,588 --> 00:06:45,981
With all due respect, it isn't absurd,
as evidenced by Walt Cummings' "suicide".

108
00:06:47,229 --> 00:06:49,299
That was different.

109
00:06:49,389 --> 00:06:52,029
You told me yourself that was necessary.

110
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:55,863
I assume that one day others
will tell you the very same thing about me.

111
00:06:55,949 --> 00:07:00,819
Chris, you and I have been in this
from the beginning.

112
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:03,789
Destroying that recording protects both of us.

113
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:08,262
I'm sorry, Mr. President. I give you my word
it will be kept in a very safe place,

114
00:07:08,351 --> 00:07:12,583
and it will only be made public
should I meet with some... accident.

115
00:07:12,671 --> 00:07:16,301
<i>- Chris, this is completely unnecessary.
- I'm sure it is, sir.</i>

116
00:07:16,392 --> 00:07:20,749
Then again, I am a very cautious man.

117
00:07:30,274 --> 00:07:34,232
- Chloe, have you got Henderson?
- He's three quarters of a mile ahead.

118
00:07:34,313 --> 00:07:36,111
He should be farther along.

119
00:07:36,194 --> 00:07:40,108
- It's definitely the car he left in.
- How long until I've got a visual?

120
00:07:40,194 --> 00:07:43,267
The road curves.
You should see him once it straightens.

121
00:07:43,355 --> 00:07:45,265
Hold on.

122
00:07:54,396 --> 00:07:56,113
Got him.

123
00:08:18,638 --> 00:08:20,595
Get down.

124
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,799
Damn!

125
00:08:51,882 --> 00:08:54,680
It's over, Christopher.

126
00:08:54,762 --> 00:08:56,799
Turn around.

127
00:08:58,362 --> 00:09:01,274
Put the gun down
and keep your hands where I can see them.

128
00:09:01,363 --> 00:09:03,513
Do it or I will kill you.

129
00:09:06,363 --> 00:09:10,515
- You kill me, Jack, Secretary Heller dies too.
- What are you talking about?

130
00:09:10,603 --> 00:09:14,039
There's always a contingency plan, Jack.
You know that.

131
00:09:14,124 --> 00:09:18,482
My men have been tracking Heller from
a chopper ever since he left Logan's retreat.

132
00:09:18,564 --> 00:09:24,480
If I can't contact them every 15 minutes on the
dot, they have orders to kill Secretary Heller,

133
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:27,716
which means you got about...
three minutes to save his life.

134
00:09:27,805 --> 00:09:29,921
Jack.

135
00:09:30,006 --> 00:09:34,397
- Audrey, please get back in the car.
- Is he lying about my father?

136
00:09:34,485 --> 00:09:37,637
Slowly, walk towards me.

137
00:09:38,086 --> 00:09:42,478
Put your hands behind your head.
Get on your knees.

138
00:09:46,047 --> 00:09:48,561
Cuff yourself.

139
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:55,526
Yeah, Jack.

140
00:09:55,608 --> 00:10:00,204
Patch me through to Secretary Heller's
cellphone. Lock a satellite on his signal.

141
00:10:00,288 --> 00:10:05,602
Download a visual of his vehicle on my PDA.
He left the retreat just before one o'clock.

142
00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:08,601
On it. Open up a parallel channel
on the NSA's land sats.

143
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:13,524
Scan radio slices in three-mile
increments emanating from the retreat. Sir.

144
00:10:13,609 --> 00:10:17,569
Jack, I'm pulling up the DOD database.
Here it is. I'm patching you through.

145
00:10:17,651 --> 00:10:20,119
Copy that.

146
00:10:23,651 --> 00:10:25,208
- Heller.
- It's Jack.

147
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:29,171
I need you to confirm for me
if a helicopter has been tracking your vehicle.

148
00:10:29,251 --> 00:10:34,201
- What's going on, Jack?
- Time is critical. Is there a helicopter or not?

149
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:39,523
Yeah, there's a chopper. Who are they?

150
00:10:39,613 --> 00:10:43,322
Henderson's men.
He claims they'll kill you if I don't let him go.

151
00:10:43,413 --> 00:10:47,043
- Is he bluffing?
- He doesn't do that, sir.

152
00:10:48,413 --> 00:10:51,405
Jack, I've got Heller's car.
I'm patching it to your PDA.

153
00:10:51,494 --> 00:10:53,530
Copy that.

154
00:11:00,255 --> 00:11:02,370
Jack,

155
00:11:02,454 --> 00:11:05,891
they have a laser sight trained on me.

156
00:11:05,975 --> 00:11:07,807
Get up.

157
00:11:10,696 --> 00:11:13,005
You give me the recording, I let you go.

158
00:11:13,095 --> 00:11:17,886
No. Come on, Jack. You're wasting time.
We both know you're not gonna let Heller die.

159
00:11:17,976 --> 00:11:19,854
<i>Don't let him do this.</i>

160
00:11:19,937 --> 00:11:23,771
I'm gonna walk out of here,
and you're not gonna stop me, so uncuff me.

161
00:11:23,857 --> 00:11:27,372
<i>- Jack, don't let him go!
- I don't have a choice, sir.</i>

162
00:11:27,457 --> 00:11:31,336
Yes, you do. If I had listened to you,
none of this would be happening.

163
00:11:31,418 --> 00:11:33,329
This is my responsibility.

164
00:11:33,418 --> 00:11:37,536
I will not allow Logan and Henderson
to use me as a pawn.

165
00:11:37,618 --> 00:11:40,257
<i>- Sir.
- Do not let them get away with this.</i>

166
00:11:40,339 --> 00:11:44,491
Make sure that the recording
gets to the right people.

167
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:49,490
Tell Audrey I love her.

168
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:52,457
- Mr. Secretary, what are you doing?
- No.

169
00:12:14,902 --> 00:12:20,181
Chloe, are you on the line? Can you confirm
that Heller just drove his car into the lake?

170
00:12:22,103 --> 00:12:23,741
Yes.

171
00:12:23,824 --> 00:12:25,257
Damn you!

172
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:27,174
Oh, my God! No!

173
00:12:33,304 --> 00:12:36,102
How could you do this?

174
00:12:36,545 --> 00:12:39,900
This isn't about
what you think is best for the country.

175
00:12:39,984 --> 00:12:42,818
This is about your greed for power.

176
00:12:42,905 --> 00:12:47,502
Today you have been responsible for killing
David Palmer and the Secretary of Defense.

177
00:12:47,586 --> 00:12:49,736
- Two real patriots.
- Oh, God.

178
00:12:49,826 --> 00:12:54,138
Damn you.
What happened to you?

179
00:12:56,706 --> 00:12:59,016
- Give me the recording.
- I don't have it.

180
00:12:59,107 --> 00:13:01,099
Where is it?

181
00:13:01,187 --> 00:13:04,623
I'm not gonna tell you, you know that,
no matter what you do to me.

182
00:13:04,707 --> 00:13:06,265
Do it.

183
00:13:06,347 --> 00:13:08,737
Kill him, Jack. Do it!

184
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:34,899
Yeah?
- Graham?

185
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:38,461
- Cancel the action against Henderson.
- Why?

186
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:44,547
He has the recording, but he's arranged to
have it released if anything happens to him.

187
00:13:45,231 --> 00:13:48,747
- You should've exercised more control.
- There's a limit to what I can do.

188
00:13:48,832 --> 00:13:51,790
- Apparently.
- Don't you use that tone with me.

189
00:13:51,873 --> 00:13:53,590
<i>We've both made mistakes.</i>

190
00:13:53,672 --> 00:13:56,027
You're right. Mr. President, my apologies.

191
00:13:56,112 --> 00:14:00,345
But the fact is
we have a bigger problem than Henderson.

192
00:14:00,434 --> 00:14:02,425
What are you talking about?

193
00:14:02,513 --> 00:14:05,425
At least he acts rationally in his own interests.

194
00:14:05,513 --> 00:14:07,583
Unfortunately this is not true of your wife.

195
00:14:11,354 --> 00:14:12,343
My wife?

196
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:16,508
There's a Secret Service agent named Pierce
who knows more than he should.

197
00:14:16,595 --> 00:14:21,669
- He intends to share that with Martha.
- I've taken steps to deal with Agent Pierce.

198
00:14:21,755 --> 00:14:26,955
The real problem is Mrs. Logan. She continues
to ask questions, talk about her suspicions.

199
00:14:27,036 --> 00:14:29,550
People don't take her seriously.

200
00:14:29,637 --> 00:14:33,675
There are too many loose ends.
We cannot have her unravel everything.

201
00:14:33,757 --> 00:14:39,036
- You think I don't realise that?
- I think you are in a very difficult position.

202
00:14:39,118 --> 00:14:45,114
You hoped the situation with Martha
would resolve itself. You must silence her.

203
00:14:45,357 --> 00:14:49,146
I know. But I'll handle this myself.

204
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:55,871
Mrs. Logan, Agent Pierce was transferred.

205
00:14:55,958 --> 00:15:00,271
That's what you keep saying, but it doesn't
make sense, not at one in the morning.

206
00:15:00,359 --> 00:15:02,112
We work around the clock, ma'am.

207
00:15:02,199 --> 00:15:06,875
It's quite common for agents
to get pulled off details at odd hours.

208
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:10,999
Right when they're supposed
to have a meeting with the first lady?

209
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:14,710
- I don't know anything about a meeting.
- Well, I do.

210
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,430
I found Aaron's phone on the ground
where we were supposed to meet.

211
00:15:18,521 --> 00:15:22,196
Now, I want you to find Agent Pierce,
and get him back here right now.

212
00:15:22,281 --> 00:15:25,034
There's a glitch in the scheduling software.

213
00:15:25,121 --> 00:15:28,159
- Are these glitches quite common as well?
- Actually, no.

214
00:15:28,242 --> 00:15:29,961
Mrs. Logan.

215
00:15:30,042 --> 00:15:33,513
I'm Agent Adams.
I think I can explain everything.

216
00:15:33,602 --> 00:15:35,514
- Well?
- This is a sensitive issue.

217
00:15:35,603 --> 00:15:39,482
President Logan
would like you to come with me.

218
00:15:49,284 --> 00:15:52,880
What is this sensitive information?
Is it about Agent Pierce?

219
00:15:52,965 --> 00:15:56,593
- You need to talk to the president about that.
- I'm asking you.

220
00:15:56,684 --> 00:15:58,482
Do you know where Aaron Pierce is?

221
00:15:58,564 --> 00:16:02,524
- No, ma'am, I don't.
- Is this where my husband is?

222
00:16:02,606 --> 00:16:04,915
I want to talk to him.

223
00:16:05,446 --> 00:16:07,517
Charles?

224
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:22,322
Hello?

225
00:16:33,968 --> 00:16:35,482
Yeah.

226
00:16:35,569 --> 00:16:38,561
- Henderson doesn't have the recording.
- Is it in his car?

227
00:16:38,649 --> 00:16:41,721
- No. There must've been a hand-off.
- What do you mean?

228
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:45,519
That explains why he wasn't
farther ahead when I left the airfield.

229
00:16:45,609 --> 00:16:50,001
- He must've given it to someone.
- OK, I'll back-trace the route with the satellite.

230
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:53,003
- See if I can spot anything.
- Yeah.

231
00:16:53,091 --> 00:16:56,528
Jack, we're getting that recording
and exposing Logan.

232
00:16:56,611 --> 00:17:01,241
I don't care how far I have to go or
what I have to do. Do you understand, Jack?

233
00:17:01,331 --> 00:17:02,811
Yes.

234
00:17:05,052 --> 00:17:07,691
- Go ahead.
- You were right. I found the hand-off.

235
00:17:07,773 --> 00:17:11,970
- Henderson rendezvoused with another car.
- Can you track the other car?

236
00:17:12,053 --> 00:17:16,969
We're tracking it. It headed back to Van Nuys.
Looks like the civilian side of the airfield.

237
00:17:17,053 --> 00:17:19,203
Pulled onto the tarmac.

238
00:17:19,294 --> 00:17:22,730
- Whoever it was got onto the plane.
- Isn't air traffic grounded?

239
00:17:22,813 --> 00:17:27,604
- Yeah, this is not a commercial flight.
- The plane is servicing. It's about to take off.

240
00:17:27,694 --> 00:17:30,255
Was Curtis relieved of his duty
or is he at CTU?

241
00:17:30,334 --> 00:17:33,930
He's at CTU taking orders
from Homeland Security, but I trust him.

242
00:17:34,016 --> 00:17:35,334
Where is he?

243
00:17:35,414 --> 00:17:39,374
According to the deployment grid,
25 miles northwest of you with a tac team.

244
00:17:39,455 --> 00:17:42,289
Call him.
Get him to this location as soon as possible.

245
00:17:42,376 --> 00:17:45,129
I want him to transfer
Henderson and Audrey to CTU.

246
00:17:45,216 --> 00:17:47,650
Is that a good idea?
Logan's in control at CTU.

247
00:17:47,736 --> 00:17:52,174
Curtis will protect them. It's our best chance
to get Audrey medical attention.

248
00:17:52,257 --> 00:17:53,929
I'm calling Curtis now.

249
00:17:54,017 --> 00:17:55,848
- Thanks.
- What's happening?

250
00:17:55,937 --> 00:17:59,976
The person Henderson gave the recording to
boarded a plane at Van Nuys.

251
00:18:00,057 --> 00:18:03,846
- Why aren't you going now?
- I'll go when Curtis gets here. He's not far.

252
00:18:03,937 --> 00:18:06,577
- I'll be fine until then.
- I won't leave you alone.

253
00:18:06,659 --> 00:18:11,096
Jack, if you don't get that recording,
my father will have died for nothing.

254
00:18:11,858 --> 00:18:13,655
Jack...

255
00:18:14,498 --> 00:18:16,615
for me.

256
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:30,058
Henderson is secure. When he regains
consciousness, don't go anywhere near him.

257
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:34,340
- You don't even talk to him. You understand?
- I understand.

258
00:18:35,422 --> 00:18:39,812
We have to assume his people are looking
for him. They'll monitor non-VPN traffic,

259
00:18:39,901 --> 00:18:44,612
which means you can't make or receive
any calls unless they come from me.

260
00:18:44,702 --> 00:18:48,251
- It's Wexler's cell. I've got the number.
- All right.

261
00:18:48,342 --> 00:18:52,381
- Audrey, I don't feel right about this.
- I'm gonna be all right.

262
00:19:04,624 --> 00:19:06,819
I'm so sorry.

263
00:19:07,305 --> 00:19:09,296
Jack, you have to go now.

264
00:19:17,265 --> 00:19:19,335
Jack.

265
00:19:19,425 --> 00:19:22,339
Make sure you get that recording.

266
00:19:22,426 --> 00:19:24,257
I will.

267
00:19:37,427 --> 00:19:41,466
Let me know when you're done.
Bierko has regained consciousness.

268
00:19:41,548 --> 00:19:45,461
We're waiting for the medical assessment
before we begin the interrogation.

269
00:19:45,549 --> 00:19:48,939
- Let me know when we get the go-ahead.
- Final protocol shifts.

270
00:19:49,029 --> 00:19:54,945
You can tell Washington the transfer of
authority from CTU to Homeland is complete.

271
00:19:55,029 --> 00:19:56,747
OK.

272
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:03,019
Two hours ahead of schedule, Karen.
That is remarkable.

273
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:06,261
- I'm sorry. My head is somewhere else.
- Where?

274
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:10,503
We gave the president Bauer's location
an hour ago. We should've heard something.

275
00:20:10,591 --> 00:20:15,301
- The military authority is handling Bauer.
- I know, but this doesn't make any sense.

276
00:20:15,391 --> 00:20:20,910
The president insisted we focus on Bauer. We
find him, he hands the mission to the military.

277
00:20:20,992 --> 00:20:24,463
Karen, we're out of that loop.

278
00:20:25,873 --> 00:20:28,068
- Karen Hayes.
- We have a problem.

279
00:20:28,513 --> 00:20:32,028
Chloe O'Brian got out of Holding,
and she is not in the building.

280
00:20:32,113 --> 00:20:33,832
How's that possible?

281
00:20:33,913 --> 00:20:36,382
I'm gathering details. I reviewed the tape.

282
00:20:36,473 --> 00:20:39,546
It looks like Shari talked to her,
and Shari let her go.

283
00:20:39,633 --> 00:20:41,511
Shari didn't try to stop her? Why?

284
00:20:41,594 --> 00:20:44,233
I don't know.
I had security take her into custody.

285
00:20:44,314 --> 00:20:47,273
Good. Bring her up here right now.

286
00:20:49,795 --> 00:20:52,548
We need to focus on how we find Chloe now.

287
00:20:52,995 --> 00:20:56,749
- My guess is she'll try to contact Bauer.
- I agree, but how?

288
00:20:56,835 --> 00:21:00,670
She was using CTU resources before
to help Bauer. Maybe she'll try again.

289
00:21:00,756 --> 00:21:03,066
She could try to access our system remotely.

290
00:21:03,157 --> 00:21:05,465
- All she needs is a laptop.
- That's right.

291
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:08,355
- She'll disguise her traffic.
- Can you get through it?

292
00:21:08,436 --> 00:21:12,351
- I can trace her location from the binary.
- Do it.

293
00:21:18,077 --> 00:21:20,114
Wait outside.

294
00:21:20,198 --> 00:21:22,758
Why did you let Chloe escape?

295
00:21:23,639 --> 00:21:26,915
<i>- She intimidated me.
- She intimidated you?</i>

296
00:21:26,999 --> 00:21:28,829
Sit down.

297
00:21:28,918 --> 00:21:32,150
You are in a great deal of trouble,
Ms Rothenberg.

298
00:21:32,239 --> 00:21:34,707
You had better start talking to me now.

299
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,027
She said she'd recommend me
for psychiatric evaluation and I'd lose my job.

300
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:46,478
I'm sorry, Ms Hayes. There's something
wrong with me. I should see someone...

301
00:21:46,561 --> 00:21:50,793
Shari, did Chloe tell you why she
was helping Audrey Raines and Bauer?

302
00:21:50,881 --> 00:21:53,918
- She thinks Jack is innocent.
- Based on what?

303
00:21:54,001 --> 00:22:00,681
Based on some absurd idea
that President Logan framed Bauer.

304
00:22:00,762 --> 00:22:05,711
She said something about the president being
involved in David Palmer's assassination.

305
00:22:05,802 --> 00:22:08,396
Can you believe her?

306
00:22:08,483 --> 00:22:11,078
And people think I'm crazy.

307
00:22:12,604 --> 00:22:15,038
Dammit! Open this door!

308
00:22:15,123 --> 00:22:17,432
I don't know what you think you're doing.

309
00:22:17,523 --> 00:22:20,118
- Unlock it.
Open it!

310
00:22:21,644 --> 00:22:24,204
Charles.

311
00:22:24,285 --> 00:22:26,879
I want that man arrested!

312
00:22:26,965 --> 00:22:30,116
- And I want to know where Aaron Pierce is.
- Shh.

313
00:22:30,204 --> 00:22:32,196
Martha, calm down.

314
00:22:32,285 --> 00:22:35,483
All right? Aaron's fine.

315
00:22:35,565 --> 00:22:37,955
I just transferred him back to Washington.

316
00:22:38,046 --> 00:22:42,198
In the middle of the night? It makes no sense.
Why am I locked in this room?

317
00:22:42,285 --> 00:22:44,004
Because we need to talk.

318
00:22:44,086 --> 00:22:45,917
About what?

319
00:22:56,727 --> 00:23:01,962
I've been wanting to tell you this, but I told
myself that you were too fragile to handle it.

320
00:23:02,048 --> 00:23:04,517
But that's not the truth.

321
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:11,243
The truth is I've kept this from you
because it's horrible, and because it's ugly.

322
00:23:11,329 --> 00:23:13,923
What are you talking about?

323
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:22,288
What happened to Palmer shouldn't have. He
got involved in something he shouldn't have.

324
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:24,088
What are you saying?

325
00:23:27,051 --> 00:23:29,361
That I never authorised his death.

326
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:35,051
You mean...

327
00:23:35,131 --> 00:23:38,124
- you know who killed David?
- Yes.

328
00:23:39,332 --> 00:23:41,051
How do you know that?

329
00:23:42,533 --> 00:23:44,443
- He works for me.
- What?

330
00:23:44,533 --> 00:23:46,251
- It's very complicated.
- What?

331
00:23:46,332 --> 00:23:49,689
- There's an explanation.
- What? An explanation? Oh, my God!

332
00:23:49,773 --> 00:23:52,334
- Stop! You don't understand.
- Go to hell!

333
00:23:52,414 --> 00:23:55,883
Oh, my God!
You're involved with David's murder.

334
00:23:55,973 --> 00:24:00,650
- Martha.
- Oh, my God! Why are you telling me this?

335
00:24:00,734 --> 00:24:02,645
Why are you telling me this?

336
00:24:02,735 --> 00:24:06,250
Because you're on your way
to finding out the truth on your own.

337
00:24:06,336 --> 00:24:08,290
And because you need to stop.

338
00:24:11,455 --> 00:24:15,654
- Stop what?
- Asking questions and talking about this.

339
00:24:15,736 --> 00:24:21,413
Never again. Do you know how traumatic this
would be for the country if people found out?

340
00:24:21,496 --> 00:24:23,771
Oh, yes, you're worried about the country.

341
00:24:23,857 --> 00:24:27,566
Dammit, that's the most
important part of this!

342
00:24:27,657 --> 00:24:31,617
This would destroy the American
people's faith in their government.

343
00:24:31,698 --> 00:24:35,690
It would destroy our credibility
all over the world.

344
00:24:35,778 --> 00:24:37,496
You lied to me.

345
00:24:37,578 --> 00:24:42,937
Everything,
this whole day has been one giant lie.

346
00:24:43,019 --> 00:24:47,614
- What you've done makes me sick!
- Martha, enough.

347
00:24:47,699 --> 00:24:53,730
I know that what I did, what I allowed
to happen, was a terrible mistake,

348
00:24:53,819 --> 00:24:56,459
but it's done.

349
00:24:57,539 --> 00:25:01,295
Right now, I need you to swear to me

350
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:05,169
that you will do as I ask...

351
00:25:07,021 --> 00:25:09,933
for the country, Martha.

352
00:25:16,662 --> 00:25:20,018
I've forgiven you many things, Charles,

353
00:25:20,103 --> 00:25:22,297
but not this.

354
00:25:23,382 --> 00:25:25,850
You've broken my heart.

355
00:25:27,663 --> 00:25:30,416
I'm looking at you, and...

356
00:25:31,504 --> 00:25:33,813
I hate you.

357
00:25:42,705 --> 00:25:46,617
But I will keep my mouth shut,

358
00:25:47,905 --> 00:25:52,899
because the people of this country
don't deserve to suffer.

359
00:25:53,746 --> 00:25:56,897
You do, Charles, you do.

360
00:26:21,869 --> 00:26:25,578
Are you sure we're going to get through this
the way we planned?

361
00:26:25,669 --> 00:26:30,459
- What does that mean?
- There are too many loose ends.

362
00:26:30,549 --> 00:26:33,428
What operation
doesn't have loose ends? Hm?

363
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:36,307
Of course we won't get through this
the way we planned.

364
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:40,907
I have never made a deal that didn't feel
like it would fall apart in the 11th hour.

365
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:44,108
Now, if you don't have the stomach
to deal with a few bumps,

366
00:26:44,191 --> 00:26:47,707
then this is not the room where you belong.

367
00:26:48,431 --> 00:26:54,223
And that goes for all of you. You're starting to
have doubts. I can smell it, and I don't like it.

368
00:26:54,312 --> 00:26:59,706
We need to remember the strength we had
18 months ago when we started this thing.

369
00:27:01,672 --> 00:27:03,424
We OK, Ron?

370
00:27:03,513 --> 00:27:05,947
Yeah.

371
00:27:06,033 --> 00:27:08,672
Think about your kids.

372
00:27:08,754 --> 00:27:12,507
That's what I do when I need to get focused.
Yeah.

373
00:27:12,594 --> 00:27:15,666
The situation with Martha is taken care of.

374
00:27:15,754 --> 00:27:17,824
<i>- I spoke to her.
- And?</i>

375
00:27:17,914 --> 00:27:21,544
And I made it very clear
that if she continues with this behaviour,

376
00:27:21,635 --> 00:27:24,070
I will send her back
to the hospital in Vermont.

377
00:27:24,156 --> 00:27:28,866
Well, you were going to have her committed
earlier today, but you changed your mind.

378
00:27:28,956 --> 00:27:33,746
That's because she found out the truth,
and I decided I should keep her close.

379
00:27:33,836 --> 00:27:38,432
- What if she finds out the truth again?
- She won't.

380
00:27:38,516 --> 00:27:43,147
And if she does, I will handle it,
just like I have all day.

381
00:27:43,237 --> 00:27:44,272
OK.

382
00:27:44,357 --> 00:27:49,148
Fair enough. You have done a remarkable job
today, Mr. President. I will admit that.

383
00:27:49,238 --> 00:27:53,629
Thank you. It's about time
I heard some words of appreciation.

384
00:27:53,718 --> 00:27:57,074
We were just talking about
how you've had to be on the front line,

385
00:27:57,159 --> 00:27:59,719
how you've had to get your hands dirty,

386
00:27:59,799 --> 00:28:04,509
while we could just sit back
and watch from a safe distance.

387
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:07,989
You've earned our trust, and I am sure...

388
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:13,240
that you will do whatever it takes
to keep your wife in line.

389
00:28:28,041 --> 00:28:30,636
Audrey.

390
00:28:30,721 --> 00:28:33,111
Where's Jack?

391
00:28:34,682 --> 00:28:37,993
Audrey, I'm sorry about your father.

392
00:28:39,082 --> 00:28:42,155
I never intended your father
to get in the middle of this.

393
00:28:42,243 --> 00:28:47,557
I've known Secretary Heller a very long time,
and he's an honourable man.

394
00:28:47,644 --> 00:28:50,033
Wait a minute. What time is it?

395
00:28:51,283 --> 00:28:53,957
It's ten or twelve minutes since...

396
00:28:54,044 --> 00:28:58,356
If the windows didn't collapse when the car
hit the water, there could be an air pocket.

397
00:28:58,445 --> 00:29:01,881
20, 30 minutes in a submerged car,
if there's an air pocket...

398
00:29:01,966 --> 00:29:05,878
- Stop it.
- Your father could be alive, Audrey.

399
00:29:05,965 --> 00:29:11,120
Secretary Heller could be alive inside that car.
If he's alive, you gotta do something about it.

400
00:29:11,206 --> 00:29:16,564
If there's a possibility he's living, you gotta
call military authority or emergency services.

401
00:29:16,646 --> 00:29:23,359
- For God's sakes, he's your father.
- Stop it! Stop it! Stop! Stop! Stop talking!

402
00:29:32,448 --> 00:29:35,361
What do you think? I'm stupid?

403
00:29:36,769 --> 00:29:39,727
You want me to make that call
so your people can find me.

404
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:44,246
Audrey, my people are gonna find us anyway,
and Jack's not gonna stop all this.

405
00:29:44,329 --> 00:29:46,240
I'm trying to help your father.

406
00:29:46,329 --> 00:29:49,606
He's drowning in a car
and you're not doing anything about it.

407
00:29:49,691 --> 00:29:51,921
- You're gonna live with that?
- Shut up.

408
00:29:52,011 --> 00:29:55,844
He is dying and you're doing nothing,
Audrey. You are doing nothing.

409
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:57,683
I swear to God,

410
00:29:57,771 --> 00:30:01,127
not another word.

411
00:30:17,972 --> 00:30:20,931
Yeah.

412
00:30:21,013 --> 00:30:23,208
<i>- Jack?
- I've got a visual on the plane.</i>

413
00:30:23,294 --> 00:30:26,366
It must be a diplomatic flight.
There's a lot of security.

414
00:30:26,454 --> 00:30:28,331
- We have a problem.
- What?

415
00:30:28,414 --> 00:30:31,884
I'm tracking the helicopter
Henderson's men used to shadow Heller.

416
00:30:31,974 --> 00:30:36,207
- And?
- It's heading towards Audrey and Henderson.

417
00:30:36,295 --> 00:30:39,288
- How could they find them?
- Maybe by using satellites.

418
00:30:39,375 --> 00:30:42,094
- But they'll be there any second.
- Where's Curtis?

419
00:30:42,175 --> 00:30:45,725
He might not make it there
before Henderson's men, Jack.

420
00:30:45,815 --> 00:30:51,414
Upload your visual to my PDA. Advise
Curtis of the situation. I'll get back to you.

421
00:30:59,217 --> 00:31:00,536
- Jack.
- Listen.

422
00:31:00,618 --> 00:31:03,928
Henderson's men
are heading back towards you.

423
00:31:04,018 --> 00:31:06,451
- You've gotta get out of there.
- And leave him?

424
00:31:06,537 --> 00:31:10,213
<i>- We don't have a choice.
- Yes, we do. I have the gun and I can kill him.</i>

425
00:31:10,298 --> 00:31:15,692
We need him alive. Curtis's team is almost
there. They'll secure him. Get out of there.

426
00:31:15,779 --> 00:31:19,532
He's responsible for the death of my father.
I can't leave him here!

427
00:31:19,619 --> 00:31:25,331
Audrey, please, listen to what I'm telling you.
You've gotta start moving now! Audrey!

428
00:31:34,461 --> 00:31:37,134
On the right.

429
00:31:37,221 --> 00:31:39,132
Take the other side.

430
00:31:43,461 --> 00:31:47,011
Stipe, get over
and get these handcuffs off me.

431
00:31:53,103 --> 00:31:54,377
Dammit!

432
00:31:54,463 --> 00:31:59,981
Heller's daughter is in this building. Kill her.
Then get back here. We'll deal with Bauer.

433
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:14,062
Audrey, it's Curtis.

434
00:32:14,145 --> 00:32:16,979
Stay behind me.

435
00:32:28,827 --> 00:32:32,058
Hold it right there! Hands on your head.

436
00:32:32,147 --> 00:32:33,943
Let's go. Move.

437
00:32:40,028 --> 00:32:43,464
- Secure him for transport back to CTU.
- Yes, sir.

438
00:32:43,548 --> 00:32:45,981
- You OK?
- Yeah.

439
00:32:46,707 --> 00:32:49,223
Tac team, hostiles are down.
We have Henderson.

440
00:32:49,308 --> 00:32:51,777
<i>Roger that, sir.</i>

441
00:32:54,349 --> 00:32:59,423
Copy.
We need medical attention for Audrey Raines.

442
00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:05,787
Yeah?

443
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:07,589
<i>- It's me.
- What's happening?</i>

444
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:13,746
Curtis's team killed Henderson's men,
and they're taking Henderson into custody.

445
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:16,265
Jack, I tried to shoot him, but I couldn't.

446
00:33:16,351 --> 00:33:19,389
- All that matters is that you're safe.
- Yeah, I'm fine.

447
00:33:19,471 --> 00:33:21,746
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

448
00:33:21,831 --> 00:33:24,141
OK, good. Let me speak to Curtis.

449
00:33:24,232 --> 00:33:26,905
Curtis. It's Jack.

450
00:33:26,992 --> 00:33:28,984
Go ahead.

451
00:33:31,073 --> 00:33:32,108
Yeah, Jack.

452
00:33:32,193 --> 00:33:36,470
Transport Audrey back to CTU as quickly
as possible, and get her over to Medical.

453
00:33:36,553 --> 00:33:39,944
Tell Karen Hayes
that no one is to have access to Henderson.

454
00:33:40,033 --> 00:33:42,866
She'll be taken care of,
but as far as Henderson goes,

455
00:33:42,954 --> 00:33:45,708
CTU wants to apprehend you,
not take your advice.

456
00:33:45,794 --> 00:33:49,389
Just do what you can, and I'll get back to you.

457
00:33:52,315 --> 00:33:56,389
- Jack, is Audrey all right?
- Yes. Curtis is in control of the situation.

458
00:33:56,476 --> 00:33:59,273
- What do you have on the plane?
- Details just came in.

459
00:33:59,355 --> 00:34:04,350
It is a chartered diplomatic flight.
Security level eight, leaving at 2am or sooner.

460
00:34:04,436 --> 00:34:08,635
Find out who's on board so we can figure out
who Henderson gave the recording to.

461
00:34:08,716 --> 00:34:11,708
It won't be easy getting past the firewall.

462
00:34:11,796 --> 00:34:16,109
I understand. Bill, slow down the departure
of this flight so I can get on it.

463
00:34:16,197 --> 00:34:21,511
All right, Jack. There's a maintenance gate
on the northwest side of the airfield.

464
00:34:21,598 --> 00:34:24,634
- You'll be able to get close to the plane.
- I'm there.

465
00:34:24,718 --> 00:34:28,792
Just get back to me
as soon as you've got the passenger list.

466
00:35:18,924 --> 00:35:20,915
Here you go.

467
00:35:26,083 --> 00:35:28,678
He's clear.
- Go ahead.

468
00:35:56,208 --> 00:35:57,527
- Yeah.
- Jack.

469
00:35:57,608 --> 00:36:01,965
We've tried everything. We can't
delay the plane. It takes off in ten minutes.

470
00:36:02,047 --> 00:36:06,121
- OK. Has Chloe got the passenger list?
- I still can't get past the firewall.

471
00:36:06,208 --> 00:36:08,676
- Chloe, I need that list.
- Jack, I'm trying.

472
00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:25,924
There you are.

473
00:36:26,009 --> 00:36:29,207
Yeah.

474
00:36:29,291 --> 00:36:31,122
<i>- I got O'Brian.
- On our system?</i>

475
00:36:31,211 --> 00:36:34,806
Yeah, she's trying to log in
to the State Department network.

476
00:36:34,892 --> 00:36:38,406
- Do we know why?
- No. She used a work-around I'd never seen.

477
00:36:38,491 --> 00:36:43,771
- I machine-coded a matrix to get through...
- We just need to find her. Where is she?

478
00:36:43,852 --> 00:36:46,446
I'm running a physical trace.

479
00:36:49,813 --> 00:36:55,126
It's a private house.
Cross-referencing with property records.

480
00:36:56,854 --> 00:37:00,085
Karen, she's working
out of Bill Buchanan's house.

481
00:37:00,174 --> 00:37:02,085
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

482
00:37:02,175 --> 00:37:04,608
We have a tac team not far away.

483
00:37:04,693 --> 00:37:06,412
I'll dispatch them now.

484
00:37:06,494 --> 00:37:09,851
- What's their ETA?
- I'm showing less then seven minutes.

485
00:37:09,935 --> 00:37:12,052
Good. Keep me posted.

486
00:37:23,696 --> 00:37:25,892
<i>- Novick.
- Mike, it's Karen Hayes.</i>

487
00:37:27,017 --> 00:37:30,373
Karen. How are things going over there?

488
00:37:30,457 --> 00:37:34,006
It's a bit of a rough transition
but we're getting through it.

489
00:37:34,097 --> 00:37:37,407
<i>- That's good to hear. What do you need?
- Some clarification.</i>

490
00:37:37,498 --> 00:37:39,615
We were sent here by the White House,

491
00:37:39,698 --> 00:37:44,295
but we've been dealing exclusively with
Vice President Gardner, until two hours ago.

492
00:37:44,378 --> 00:37:45,731
What happened?

493
00:37:45,819 --> 00:37:48,652
The president ordered me to arrest Jack Bauer

494
00:37:48,739 --> 00:37:51,538
on evidence
he was unwilling to share with me.

495
00:37:51,619 --> 00:37:54,008
Yes, I know about that.

496
00:37:54,459 --> 00:37:57,610
- Have you seen the evidence?
- No, actually, I-I haven't.

497
00:37:57,700 --> 00:38:03,571
- Mike, who has seen it?
- I don't have a good answer for that.

498
00:38:04,221 --> 00:38:06,496
Are you telling me you're not in the loop?

499
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:10,290
Actually, I don't even think there is a loop.

500
00:38:10,381 --> 00:38:13,852
The president
is keeping his own counsel at the moment.

501
00:38:13,942 --> 00:38:17,695
- That's a first.
- Yes.

502
00:38:17,782 --> 00:38:19,180
It is.

503
00:38:19,262 --> 00:38:21,856
Is there anything else you want to tell me?

504
00:38:21,942 --> 00:38:25,457
Nothing that I can say with any authority.

505
00:38:25,543 --> 00:38:28,342
All I know is that...

506
00:38:28,423 --> 00:38:30,493
it's been a strange night.

507
00:38:30,582 --> 00:38:32,892
<i>- I see.
- I wish I could be more helpful.</i>

508
00:38:32,983 --> 00:38:37,296
No, Mike, actually, you've been very helpful.
Thank you.

509
00:39:02,186 --> 00:39:03,904
<i>- Hello?
- This is Karen Hayes.</i>

510
00:39:03,987 --> 00:39:06,739
<i>You have less than seven minutes
to get Chloe out.</i>

511
00:39:06,826 --> 00:39:09,978
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Bill, stop.

512
00:39:10,067 --> 00:39:12,661
Miles traced Chloe through a remote node,

513
00:39:12,747 --> 00:39:18,266
and if you don't believe me, tell her he used
a machine-coded matrix to find her.

514
00:39:23,828 --> 00:39:28,381
- Karen, why are you warning us?
- Because I may have made a mistake earlier.

515
00:39:28,469 --> 00:39:30,539
A lot of things didn't make sense today,

516
00:39:30,629 --> 00:39:36,545
until Shari told me what Chloe said
about President Logan being... involved.

517
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:42,180
I've gotta go. Just get Chloe out of there now.

518
00:39:42,271 --> 00:39:45,228
- You have to go.
- I can't. Jack needs the passenger list.

519
00:39:45,311 --> 00:39:49,099
Chloe, if they find you here,
you'll be arrested. You have to go now.

520
00:39:49,191 --> 00:39:51,182
Not yet.

521
00:40:35,395 --> 00:40:38,035
- Closing doors.
- That's the last one.

522
00:40:38,116 --> 00:40:40,755
Let's get this thing out of here. Let's go.

523
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,592
Let's go.
