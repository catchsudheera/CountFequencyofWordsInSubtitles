1
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,439
Whatever you've planned next is going to fail,
just like everything else you've tried today.

2
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,071
Almost 40 dead in the train crash, many more
near the San Gabriel Island nuclear plant.

3
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,516
We managed to stop the other 103
power plants from melting down.

4
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,034
That's what America will remember,
that we stopped you.

5
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,314
No. This country will be afraid
to let their leaders appear in public.

6
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:39,520
For all the hatred that you have for this
country, you don't understand it very well.

7
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,393
Marwan.

8
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:51,316
In the next few minutes CTU will be alerted
that the pilot and his family are missing.

9
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,389
What do you think we should do?

10
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,870
We have to make sure CTU is too busy
to realise its significance.

11
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,515
Jack Bauer is alive and in my custody.

12
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:02,354
I will return him to you unharmed
in exchange for Behrooz Araz.

13
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:07,318
This is Bill Buchanan from Division.
He'll be overseeing the operation.

14
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,233
What happens if we don't
agree to the exchange?

15
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,630
- We don't get Bauer back.
- That can't be the deciding factor.

16
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:18,157
If we don't go through with this,
we may lose an opportunity to trap Marwan.

17
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,557
Is my mother in the van?
She was working with you. Where is she?

18
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,438
- I don't know.
- I don't wanna die.

19
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:31,236
<i>- </i> Sniper's down! Move out!

20
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,594
Why'd you give 'em that kid?

21
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,717
He's double-tagged.
We'll be tracking him.

22
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:39,270
<i> I managed to short-circuit</i>
<i>some phone lines. </i>

23
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,114
If you can find two service obstructions at
the same coordinates, we can get to Marwan.

24
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,511
We have a location
where Marwan was holding Jack.

25
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,271
- Yes.
- There's a problem.

26
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,113
As I was about to do a pre-flight check,
they grounded the plane.

27
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,792
Resolve this now.

28
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,510
- Did you report to the chief officer?
- I'm about to head over there now.

29
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,034
Don't let me hold you up.

30
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:05,430
- It's just a false alarm.
- All right. I'll clear it for takeoff.

31
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:21,197
We placed multiple trackers on Behrooz Araz
but those are no longer transmitting,

32
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,033
which means that Marwan's men
destroyed them.

33
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,759
- <i>Are you close to finding Marwan?</i>
We may be.

34
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,718
Bauer tagged the location
where he was being held.

35
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,268
We're preparing to mount a raid as we speak.

36
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:37,673
I want Marwan found now. I've asked
Secret Service to secure a landing site

37
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,389
so I can be on the ground
to address the nation before 11 o'clock.

38
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,040
Sir, we believe that you're safer in the air.

39
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:48,989
<i>I have been flying for 20 hours. The people</i>
<i>need to hear from me now, not tomorrow. </i>

40
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,992
Then may I suggest
you do it from Air Force One?

41
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,595
It may not be optimal,
but at least you'll get your message across.

42
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,879
I appreciate your concerns, but I'm going
to give my speech when I get to Los Angeles.

43
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:05,112
I'll inform the press corps,
give them enough time to notify their outlets.

44
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,235
Yes, sir.

45
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,915
<i>Make sure I'm briefed on Bauer's progress</i>
<i>before I go on the air. </i>

46
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,195
Of course.

47
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,511
What's Jack's status?

48
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,797
His team just arrived.
They'll be in place in a few minutes.

49
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:33,516
- <i> CTU.</i>
- Strike teams are moving into final position.

50
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:38,310
- We're five minutes out. How's your end?
- We're coordinating backup teams.

51
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,073
- Chloe?
- It's me. Michelle brought me back in.

52
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,230
Good. Are the satellites in position?

53
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:47,950
Yes. We've been monitoring the area,
but there's been no activity.

54
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:52,318
- How's Paul doing? Is he still in surgery?
- Uh, no, he just got out.

55
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,439
Chloe, I'm glad to have you back.
We're gonna need your help. Is Audrey there?

56
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,318
- I think so.
- Let me speak to her.

57
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,391
Hold on.

58
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,670
- Hello?
- Audrey, I have Jack on the line.

59
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,837
- <i>Are you there?</i>
- Yeah, I'm here.

60
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,115
- Hold for Jack.
- OK.

61
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,398
- <i> Audrey. </i>
- Jack, you OK?

62
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,948
Yeah, I'm fine. How's Paul doing?

63
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:29,750
They just finished operating,
but they said he's gonna make it.

64
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:34,630
- I'm waiting to talk to the doctors.
- Good, I'm glad.

65
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,280
Look.

66
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,957
Audrey, I know we have to talk
about how I handled everything with Paul.

67
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,679
Yeah, we do. It's just...

68
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,673
- It's really hard right now.
- Yeah, I-I understand.

69
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:56,676
- Are you out in the field?
- We're getting ready to move on Marwan.

70
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:00,878
- Be careful.
- Yeah. I'll call you as soon as it's done.

71
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,879
Yeah.

72
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,837
Right.

73
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,837
I got off the phone with DOD.
They wanna know our status.

74
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:19,310
Jack's team has been deployed.
He should begin the assault soon.

75
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:23,837
- Do you know how many hostiles are inside?
- Based on the infrared scan, eight.

76
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,832
Did voice transmission indicate
one of them is Marwan?

77
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:30,037
No, but we know he was there
25 minutes ago when Jack left.

78
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,472
If that hard drive is discovered
by the Americans,

79
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,949
it'll jeopardise the next phase of our plan.

80
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,713
- It's not here.
- You haven't looked hard enough.

81
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,519
I've been searching for almost an hour.

82
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,513
Aziz told one of his men he hid a backup copy
of those files in his apartment.

83
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,750
Why didn't Aziz tell you where he hid it?

84
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,718
Because he was killed
before he could tell me.

85
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,396
Anderson shared this apartment with Aziz.
Maybe he knows where the hard drive is.

86
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,313
Keep looking. I'll try to contact him.

87
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,037
Bravo three-niner in the air, heading 552.

88
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,795
<i> Roger Bravo three-niner. </i>
<i>You are cleared for 35,000ft. </i>

89
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,838
Bravo three-niner ascending to 35,000ft.

90
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,150
<i>Copy that. </i>

91
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,512
I'm in the air.
I should reach the target in 45 minutes.

92
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,875
- We have a problem.
- <i>What kind of problem?</i>

93
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:40,431
Aziz. He hid a backup copy of his files
in your apartment on hard drive.

94
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,080
- We haven't been able to find it.
- Ask Aziz.

95
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,515
Aziz is dead.

96
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,109
- I don't know about a hard drive.
- You have no idea where it might be?

97
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,431
<i>If I knew where it was, I'd tell you. </i>

98
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:00,388
- I just don't want to get myself killed.
- <i>I'll get back to you. </i>

99
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,035
In order to flush Marwan out,
lead your men down the main corridor.

100
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,033
- He'll try and escape through the left flank.
- Tac teams are ready to go in.

101
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,156
- Have they set the charges?
- Yes.

102
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,913
Gentlemen, we are go.

103
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,790
We've got a green light.
Teams A and B, move into position.

104
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:04,271
- All teams move in on target.
- <i> All teams, all teams... </i>

105
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,079
Prepare to ignite charges on my mark.

106
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,072
Three, two, one,

107
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,116
blow the door!

108
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,793
Go, go! Move!

109
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,558
Delete the files. Delete everything.

110
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,310
<i> They're down! They're down!</i>

111
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,118
<i>All right, let's go!</i>

112
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,314
- Hold your fire!
- Clear!

113
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,079
Marwan's not here. Notify the perimeter.

114
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:22,075
Teams one and two, Marwan is not
in the building. Maintain your perimeter.

115
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,230
Come on!

116
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:29,077
I can't stop this thing from deleting.

117
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,435
This doesn't make sense.

118
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,796
This room's hot. Get your men out.

119
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,835
Get your men outta here right now!

120
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,028
What's happening?
What's going on over there?

121
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,872
- You OK?
- I think so.

122
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,997
- Check your men!
- Jack, if you can hear me, respond.

123
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:11,392
Michelle, Marwan's escaped. He just blew up
the hard drive to all his computers.

124
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:17,350
He's covering his tracks. I'm going off comm.
If you want me, I'm gonna be on my cell.

125
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:24,396
Chloe, get data forensics in there now,
and start a hard target search for Marwan.

126
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,718
Get me a medic! Medic!

127
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,031
Too late. You can't stop it.

128
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,111
Stop what?

129
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,874
Within the hour.

130
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:45,032
What's gonna happen within the hour?

131
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,312
What's gonna happen within the hour?

132
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,196
- Mrs Raines?
- Yes.

133
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,919
- Your husband's in recovery.
- How is he?

134
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,310
He's stable. One of the bullets
did some damage to his spine.

135
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:24,188
Right now he's paralysed
from the waist down.

136
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,590
- Is it permanent?
- It's too early to tell.

137
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,639
It'll take weeks or months before we
fully understand the extent of damage.

138
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,154
So he could regain the use of his legs.

139
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,435
It's possible, yes.

140
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:43,119
- But not likely?
- Again, it's too early to tell.

141
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,236
We could go over the details later,

142
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:50,075
but I'd be lying to you
if I told you I was optimistic.

143
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,311
A lot depends on his attitude,
his support system,

144
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,595
emotional as well as medical.

145
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,959
- Does he know?
- Yes, I just told him.

146
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:08,990
- I'm sure he'd like to see you.
- Thank you.

147
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:32,517
Excuse me, can you give us a minute, please?
Thank you.

148
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:40,549
Oh, no, don't you even
think of feeling sorry for me.

149
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:43,234
Whatever they say, I'm gonna walk again.

150
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,436
I know you will.

151
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,955
So, where's Jack?

152
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,190
He's still out in the field.

153
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:06,400
He called a little while ago
and wanted to know how you were doing.

154
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,671
He knows that bullet was meant for him.

155
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:14,548
I was trying to push him out of the way.
I didn't expect to get shot myself.

156
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:19,236
What you did was very, very brave, Paul.

157
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:38,716
LAPD's widening the search perimeter,
but so far they're coming up empty.

158
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,349
- Something might happen within the hour.
- We're gonna find him.

159
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:46,752
- Did you secure Marwan yet?
- He must have slipped through the perimeter.

160
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,912
- How could you let that happen?
- It doesn't matter how.

161
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,278
What matters is that he's gone and we're
doing everything we can to find him.

162
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,079
What exactly are you doing to find him?

163
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:02,393
We've widened the perimeter, set up a search
grid. State police are conducting a sweep.

164
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,439
- Jack says he's got something.
- Put him on speaker.

165
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:09,796
It's Michelle.
You're also on with Tony and Bill Buchanan.

166
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,952
OK, look. Marwan had an area
set up for forging documents.

167
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:17,079
Some of them survived the explosion.
We secured a number of names and faces.

168
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:21,278
Castle's uploading them now.
Cross-reference them with the watch list.

169
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,238
- We'll do it now.
- Get back to me if you've got a match.

170
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,594
Edgar.

171
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,990
- I'm initialising the software now.
- Good.

172
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,071
Michelle.

173
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:36,350
Listen, um, I'm sorry if I snapped.

174
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:40,710
It's OK. We're all under a lot of pressure.

175
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,516
You holding up?

176
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,670
I'm fine.

177
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:54,236
- Edgar, how's that uplink?
- Coming up.

178
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:00,393
Chloe, how long's Buchanan
been at Division?

179
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:05,634
I don't know. It took them a while to fill
Chappelle's position. Six months?

180
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:09,349
- Where was he before that?
- Seattle, I think.

181
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,509
Seattle?

182
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:14,195
That's where Michelle was posted
while you were in jail, right?

183
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,998
Yeah.

184
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,911
Thanks.

185
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,954
We got a match.

186
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,113
This is Bauer.

187
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:31,351
We have a match on one of those photos.
He's on the FBI watch list.

188
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,273
- His name is Mitch Anderson.
- What do we got on him?

189
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:37,830
Ex-military,
arrested for drug possession, served time,

190
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,434
was dishonourably discharged
four years ago.

191
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:43,637
He's been hired as a mercenary
in a number of conflicts.

192
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:47,110
- Came back to the US about a year ago.
- Is he under investigation?

193
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:50,317
He was moved up the list,
but he wasn't made a priority.

194
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,755
The bureau sent an agent to his apartment.

195
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:55,559
- Has the agent checked in?
- They may be in transit.

196
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:59,155
OK. Get me an address on Anderson,
start digging up information,

197
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,196
and get me a number for the FBI agent.

198
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,396
<i>I'm on it. </i>

199
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,712
FBI. I'm looking for Mitch Anderson.

200
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,508
This is FBI Agent Drake.
Please open the door.

201
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,235
- Agent Drake.
- Hi. My name is Jack Bauer. I work with CTU.

202
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,676
Your office said you were
investigating Mitch Anderson.

203
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,911
- I got to his apartment a few minutes ago.
- He's not there?

204
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,754
No. Why is CTU involved?
Is there new information about Anderson?

205
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,798
We have evidence connecting him
to a man named Marwan.

206
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:13,350
Marwan's responsible
for all the terrorist activity today.

207
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,149
- We believe he's planning another attack.
- How is Anderson involved?

208
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:20,869
- I'll advise you when I get there.
- How far away are you?

209
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,157
- About ten minutes out.
- I'll be here.

210
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,231
<i>Thank you. </i>

211
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,671
<i> Yes. </i>

212
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:09,149
We had a delay.
We're heading over there now.

213
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:12,949
- <i>What about Anderson?</i>
- He's in the air, on his way to the target.

214
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,634
He's on schedule. Are your people in place?

215
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,915
<i>Yes. We're ready to deploy. </i>

216
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,798
Good. I'll see you when we arrive.

217
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,835
I'm sorry, but this just isn't cutting it.
The tone is all wrong.

218
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,878
Maybe I could give them
a clearer idea of what you want.

219
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,475
This is one of the most traumatic days
in this country's history.

220
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:42,838
What I want is a speech
that is equal to the occasion.

221
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:53,311
Give me a few minutes, will you, Robert?
Let me think about this a little while longer.

222
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,311
Of course, Mr President.

223
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,358
Oh, and Robert,
ask my son to step in, will you?

224
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,431
Yes, sir.

225
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,389
Dad?

226
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:16,271
A quick trip to Mexico, a low-key state visit,
then we'd have some time to spend together.

227
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:21,229
It's OK. The, uh, press corps
has been keeping me entertained.

228
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:26,189
You know, ever since your mother died,
I promised myself I'd be there for you.

229
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:29,431
You were doing what you had to do.

230
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:37,237
I could use your help right about now. I'm
gonna address the nation in about one hour.

231
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:41,074
- I still don't have a speech I'm happy with.
- I'm no speech writer.

232
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:44,357
No, I know, but you've got a level head,

233
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,470
and you're about
the most decent person I know.

234
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:53,395
As far as I'm concerned, you represent
the very best this country has to offer.

235
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,550
So.

236
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,677
What do you wanna hear the president say
when he addresses you tonight?

237
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,751
The truth.

238
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,510
We've been attacked by terrorists.

239
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:16,354
Americans are dead.
The man responsible is still at large.

240
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:20,069
We are by no means certain
we can catch him before he strikes again.

241
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,799
What happened earlier...

242
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:27,508
may be nothing
compared to what happens next.

243
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,755
That's the truth, Kevin.

244
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,598
Is that what you think I should say?

245
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,271
I don't know.

246
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,514
Neither do I,

247
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,909
but the fact remains...

248
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,790
I have to say something.

249
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:54,117
Do you want me to help you figure it out?

250
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,031
Absolutely.

251
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:17,028
Agent Drake?

252
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,831
Agent Drake?

253
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,638
- Drop the weapon now!
- Are you Agent Bauer?

254
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,439
- Yes! Holster your weapon!
- I need to see your ID.

255
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:43,115
I don't have ID.
I'm working with CTU on a provisional basis.

256
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,556
I talked to you ten minutes ago.
You can confirm with Division.

257
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:51,714
Agent Drake, just take it easy.
He's with me. Agent Hart, CTU.

258
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,995
Now I'm gonna holster my gun,

259
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,311
and I'm gonna show you my credentials.

260
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:07,078
I'm sorry.
But with everything that happened today,

261
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,515
- you can't be too careful.
- I understand.

262
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:15,357
We just intercepted a call indicating Anderson
was in possession of computer files

263
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,635
that could tell us Marwan's next target.

264
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:23,431
- What's the source of the intercepted call?
- I'm still waiting for the details.

265
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:29,231
- Did you find the apartment like this?
- No. There may be a backup copy of the files.

266
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,709
I was trying to find it.

267
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:39,269
Right now Anderson's our only lead. We're
gonna stay here and help you finish the job.

268
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,272
Do a canvass. I'll take upstairs.

269
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,989
- Where are you?
- I'm almost in position.

270
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,231
- What's the problem?
- Is my cover in place?

271
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:09,359
I've told you before, yes.
You'll be 100 per cent safe.

272
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:13,190
Marwan, they have to believe I'm dead.

273
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:16,192
They will. My people have taken care of this.

274
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,350
They better,

275
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:21,910
cos once this is done,
the entire world is gonna be looking for me.

276
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:42,473
<i> Recovery teams aren't gonna</i>
<i>be allowed in there for a few weeks. </i>

277
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:45,552
- I understand.
- <i>Would you pass along our condolences?</i>

278
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,756
- I'll tell him.
- <i>Sorry we couldn't help. </i>

279
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,831
Thanks, Ruben.

280
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,470
- Edgar.
- Yeah?

281
00:24:56,560 --> 00:25:01,076
I have some bad news. Do you want me
to tell you here or somewhere private?

282
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,275
What?

283
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:06,239
Ruben Weiss from OSHA said they're not
gonna be able to get into the area

284
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,073
where your mother died
for a few weeks or months.

285
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,310
- Why not?
- Think about it.

286
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,356
Half-life? Radiation?

287
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,238
- What does that mean?
- Well, he didn't spell it out,

288
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:21,155
but I think that means you're gonna have
to have your funeral without the body.

289
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,832
- Of your mother.
- I can't deal with this right now, Chloe.

290
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:28,549
Michelle needs a prioritised list
for Marwan's pursuit plan.

291
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,073
Oh.

292
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,549
OK, good.

293
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:42,952
- Do you want me to do that for you?
- No.

294
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:10,476
LAPD's locked down the area where Marwan
was last seen. Review the search grid.

295
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,312
- All right.
- Thanks.

296
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,470
Michelle.

297
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:20,470
- When were you planning on telling me?
- About what?

298
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:23,233
About you and Buchanan.

299
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:27,077
Never, because it's none of your business.

300
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,309
Michelle.

301
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:33,668
Before you worked with him at Division,
you worked with him in Seattle.

302
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,752
- Yeah.
- We were still married then.

303
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,670
Legally, yes.

304
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:43,196
Did you sleep with him
while we were married?

305
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,998
No.

306
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:47,958
- I didn't.
- But you are now.

307
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:52,271
Like I said, it's none of your business.

308
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:59,238
- Edgar, where are those updates?
- Coming right up.

309
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:14,033
Edgar, what are you doing?

310
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,190
- Ms Dessler. What?
- Edgar, wait.

311
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:29,434
Wait. I made a mistake. I used row-major
format instead of column-major.

312
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:33,559
Why would you do that, Chloe? Row-major
isn't compatible with our software.

313
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:37,633
- It'll bring all our processors to a crawl.
- I know. It was a mistake.

314
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,790
Well, fix it.

315
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,476
- Chloe, why did you cover for me?
- You're welcome.

316
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,358
You'd have your job back
if I'd handed her that disk.

317
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,318
I thought you had a lot on your mind.

318
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,669
- Agent Bauer?
- Yeah.

319
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:53,198
I checked with the neighbours.
Nobody's seen him.

320
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:58,991
- Did you talk to the manager?
- He kept to himself, paid his rent on time.

321
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:01,116
OK, thanks.

322
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,270
- Agent Drake?
- Yes.

323
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:07,672
Anderson was ex-military.
This bag is from Vanguard Mills.

324
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:12,436
They make medals for the armed forces.
There's a date stamp on it, three months old.

325
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:16,832
- Anderson left the military four years ago.
- You think he's posing as military?

326
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:20,515
There's a possibility.
Let your people know. We'll do the same.

327
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:25,071
- Have this scanned. Send it over to Chloe.
- You got it.

328
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:40,796
This is Special Agent Drake. Can you put me
through to Dawson, please? Thank you.

329
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,356
- <i>CTU, Almeida. </i>
- Tony, it's Jack.

330
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:58,594
Anderson might be posing as military. Update
the profile and see if anything comes back.

331
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:01,797
- All right, I'm on it.
- OK, thanks.

332
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:05,111
Yeah, this is Drake.
Listen, we just found credible evidence

333
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,351
suggesting that Anderson
is disguised as military.

334
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,829
That's right. Yes.

335
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,671
Fine.

336
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,917
Yes.

337
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:28,150
No, that's not a problem.

338
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,435
Good. All right, well, thanks.

339
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:34,069
I'll let you know if we find anything else.

340
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,508
Hey.

341
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:43,312
I found something. It's an external hard drive.
This is exactly what we're looking for.

342
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:46,119
That's good work.

343
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,518
Drop the weapon!

344
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,915
Son of a bitch.

345
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,633
Come on.

346
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:32,430
Edgar Stiles.

347
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:36,195
- It's Jack. Where's Chloe?
- She's busy doing a systems update.

348
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:41,912
Tell Michelle and Tony that the FBI agent was
an impostor working for Marwan. I killed her.

349
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,798
She took out my backup.
CTU needs to send out a team,

350
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,348
lock down the apartment and investigate.

351
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:51,558
- Do you wanna tell 'em yourself?
- No. Help me pull some data off a hard drive.

352
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:55,997
The directory's locked. Hold on one second.
I'm gonna put you on speakerphone.

353
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,196
- <i>Go ahead. </i>
- Can you get into the root?

354
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:04,150
- Yeah, but I can't open the files.
- Hold down tab arrow until the code appears.

355
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,149
OK.

356
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:10,118
What are the last three digits
on the part code?

357
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,713
R-2-5.

358
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:18,239
Escape out and enter pass code C-T-I-S-8-3-R.
That should backdoor you into the files.

359
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,436
Oh, my God.

360
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:35,869
- Jack, did it work?
- I'm in. I need to speak to Michelle now!

361
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:40,397
- Hold on, I'll get 'em. Jack's on the line.
- Jack, what is it?

362
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,836
I pulled some data off a hard drive
in Anderson's apartment.

363
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:48,118
On it is a flight simulator and full schematics
to an F117 A Stealth fighter.

364
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:52,751
- Anderson's an experienced pilot.
- I know. I also think he's posing as military.

365
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:56,389
I believe Mitch Anderson's
trying to steal a Stealth fighter.

366
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:11,832
- Almeida.
- Have you got anything from the air force?

367
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:14,639
Hang on, it's coming through.

368
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:19,919
An F117 A Stealth fighter took off on
a scheduled mission about 40 minutes ago.

369
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,036
The pilot did not call in on schedule.

370
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:26,318
That was about six minutes ago.
All attempts to contact that pilot have failed.

371
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:29,312
OK. We have to assume
Anderson's flying that plane.

372
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,436
- I agree.
- Is the aircraft armed?

373
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:36,230
- Yeah, standard non-nuclear ordinance.
- We need a list of obvious possible targets.

374
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,278
Yeah, right. I'm working that up right now.

375
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,634
Wait.

376
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:43,154
Air Force One is headed to LA.

377
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:46,915
- Jack, did you hear that?
- Yeah. What's the ETA?

378
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,874
11pm.

379
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:55,191
Oh, my God.
They're going after the president.

380
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,078
- I'll call Air Force One.
- We don't have a lot of time.

381
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:03,029
Get me the recall frequency for that squadron
and send Anderson's bio over to my screen.

382
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:05,111
- I'm on it.
- Where's Buchanan?

383
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,875
- He's in tactical.
- He has to tell the Joint Chiefs of Staff

384
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:12,953
that we believe the likely target
is President Keeler aboard Air Force One.

385
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:20,634
You really have been helpful, Kevin.
I think this speech strikes just the right note.

386
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:23,473
I'm sorry to interrupt. It's Dessler at CTU.

387
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:28,315
- She says it's urgent.
- Yes, what is it, Ms Dessler?

388
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:33,793
Mr President, we have reason to believe that
a Stealth fighter has been stolen by a terrorist,

389
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,996
and is in your airspace as we speak.

390
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:41,393
This plane is due to land. I'm about to address
the country. Just how sure are we about this?

391
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,391
It's a near certainty.

392
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:47,871
Your pilot is preparing to combine
evasive action with immediate descent.

393
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:50,394
You're cleared to land in Palm Springs.

394
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:54,109
I'm sure my escort fighters
are capable of protecting Air Force One.

395
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:58,239
Mr President, this is a Stealth aircraft,
invisible to radar.

396
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:02,029
If he finds you, he may be on you
before your fighter escort can react.

397
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:05,157
- What are the chances he'll find us?
- I can't be sure,

398
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:10,792
but the radar signature of a 747
and four fighter planes is unmistakeable.

399
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:15,590
You're telling me that this stolen Stealth
plane will attempt to shoot me down?

400
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,797
<i>It looks that way, Mr President. </i>

401
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,075
I see.

402
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,037
Dad?

403
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,631
It's gonna be OK.

404
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:29,315
Our plane may come under attack.
We're gonna take some precautions.

405
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:33,518
- Get me the vice president on the phone.
- Yes, sir.

406
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:47,273
All right.
It should be coming through right now.

407
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:50,352
- Yeah, I got it.
- Not much to go on. Parents deceased.

408
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:55,389
Has a sister named Alicia. It looks like
they lived together, so they might be close.

409
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:58,233
- Any contact information?
- I can find that for you.

410
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:01,756
- No time. Have you got the recall frequency?
- Yeah.

411
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:06,516
- <i>Get ready to patch me through to Anderson. </i>
- Copy that.

412
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,954
Air Force One is descending
through 20,000ft.

413
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:16,875
- The fighters have formed a protective shield.
- How long before it touches down?

414
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,838
- Nine minutes.
- And no sign of the Stealth aircraft?

415
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,912
- Not yet.
- Maybe it's not there.

416
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:28,870
It's there. We just can't see it.
We're being beaten by our own technology.

417
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:33,272
When you hit your intercom button,
you're patched through to the Stealth fighter.

418
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,430
Copy that.

419
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:47,990
<i> Mitch Anderson, can you hear me?</i>

420
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:54,428
Captain Anderson, do you read me?
My name is Jack Bauer. I'm a federal agent.

421
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:58,911
We know who you are,
we know what you're trying to do.

422
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,389
Sir, I know you can hear me.

423
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:05,989
Nothing you've done so far can't be undone.

424
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:10,198
All you have to do is change your vector
to heading 115 southeast.

425
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:14,637
That'll put you on a fast track to Edwards
Air Force Base. Once you touch down,

426
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:19,669
then we can discuss how you wanna
handle this. Please just talk to me.

427
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:24,880
Explain to me what you're trying to do,
what you're trying to accomplish.

428
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,951
<i>Why?</i>

429
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:37,239
I've been going over your service record.
It's very impressive.

430
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:40,073
Graduated top of your class,
Air Force Academy.

431
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:46,235
Highly decorated for your service in Desert
Storm including Air Force Silver Star.

432
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,880
What happened to you?

433
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,110
Explain it to me,

434
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:57,275
because what you're trying to do right now,
I don't think that's who you are.

435
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:01,194
I don't think that's how
you wanna be remembered.

436
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:05,830
If I go down, you have to stay the course.
Do you understand?

437
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,115
I'm sure it won't come to that.

438
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:12,159
<i>Charles, you're the vice president. </i>
<i>The nation will be relying on you. </i>

439
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:16,836
If the worst happens,
think of me as a casualty of war.

440
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:21,198
Don't waste time,
just pick up the torch and move forward.

441
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,511
Yes, sir, Mr President.

442
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:32,149
We think CTU is in communication
with the pilot of the stolen aircraft.

443
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,629
Patch it through.

444
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:38,872
I've just been notified by the FBI
that they've contacted your sister, Alicia.

445
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,474
They've advised her of what's happening.

446
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:44,552
She's scared.
She wants to talk to you.

447
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:52,474
All you have to do, Captain Anderson, is
respond to me and I'll put her right through.

448
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,949
Captain Anderson? Captain Anderson?

449
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,634
We've been cut off.
Is there an override channel?

450
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:04,951
He cut off all communication circuits.
We can't do anything.

451
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:05,631
Dammit!

452
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:24,948
Dad.

453
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,352
I'm scared.

454
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,476
Oh, my God.

455
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:06,440
Was Air Force One just hit?

456
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,120
Escort pilots report...

457
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:15,239
Air Force One has suffered an indirect hit
by an air-to-air missile.

458
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:20,628
Pieces are falling to the ground
over the desert.
