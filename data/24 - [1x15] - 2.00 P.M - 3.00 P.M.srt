1
00:00:11,402 --> 00:00:17,156
Right now, terrorists are plotting
to assassinate a presidential candidate,

2
00:00:17,241 --> 00:00:19,815
my wife and daughter are in danger,

3
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:23,742
and people that I work with
may be involved in both.

4
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:26,948
I'm Federal Agent Jack Bauer,

5
00:00:27,043 --> 00:00:29,960
and this is the longest day of my life.

6
00:02:21,814 --> 00:02:23,931
I can go over your head, Mr. Almeida.

7
00:02:24,014 --> 00:02:26,609
And I assure you, there will be consequences.

8
00:02:26,695 --> 00:02:29,333
I apologise, Senator, but we do have protocol.

9
00:02:29,415 --> 00:02:32,327
Our director, Ryan Chapelle,
is working on a clearance.

10
00:02:32,415 --> 00:02:37,694
- But if I could tell him why you're here...
- All he needs to know is I need to see Bauer.

11
00:02:37,775 --> 00:02:39,686
And I need to do it now.

12
00:02:41,496 --> 00:02:44,055
- Can I get you anything while...?
- No.

13
00:03:03,936 --> 00:03:05,130
Chapelle.

14
00:03:05,217 --> 00:03:09,494
I don't think I can stall him much longer.
He wants to know why he can't see Jack.

15
00:03:09,577 --> 00:03:11,932
What did you tell him?

16
00:03:12,017 --> 00:03:14,611
Well, I told him you were workin' on it.

17
00:03:15,137 --> 00:03:19,097
- And he still didn't say why he was here?
- No. He just wants to see Jack.

18
00:03:19,537 --> 00:03:23,325
Well, until I know more,
I don't wanna put those two together.

19
00:03:23,417 --> 00:03:26,216
- I'm checking it out now.
- All right.

20
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:34,610
- So? You find out what Palmer's doin' here?
- Not yet.

21
00:03:34,698 --> 00:03:39,294
- Any new intel on the backup shooters?
- Yeah, uh, an Alexis Drazen.

22
00:03:39,618 --> 00:03:43,372
Looks like he's connected to two other
shooters, but he stopped in DC for two days

23
00:03:43,459 --> 00:03:45,893
before landing in LAX on Saturday.

24
00:03:45,979 --> 00:03:48,856
There's other inconsistencies.
I'm working on it.

25
00:03:48,939 --> 00:03:51,976
- Where's the report?
- I routed it to Nina's computer.

26
00:03:52,059 --> 00:03:54,289
- Send me a copy, would ya?
- Yeah.

27
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:04,497
Weren't we supposed to answer
some questions at Jack's office?

28
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:08,050
- We're gonna do that at the safe house now.
- Is my dad gonna be there?

29
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:11,577
Not right away.
Maybe when he's done at CTU.

30
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:16,413
- Are we OK, Nina?
- Everything's fine.

31
00:04:16,701 --> 00:04:19,818
A small, controlled environment
is the most secure place for you.

32
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:22,859
- Does Jack know you're taking us?
- Of course. Myers.

33
00:04:24,101 --> 00:04:27,696
We're moving Teri and Kim to the
safe house now. We should be there soon.

34
00:04:27,781 --> 00:04:29,260
Mom...

35
00:04:29,341 --> 00:04:31,617
you never told me what the doctor said.

36
00:04:31,701 --> 00:04:34,340
No, I'm not worried about that.

37
00:04:34,421 --> 00:04:36,697
It was a cyst that burst.

38
00:04:36,781 --> 00:04:38,977
She said it wasn't serious.

39
00:04:41,222 --> 00:04:44,294
- Then why did she...?
- There's nothing to worry about.

40
00:04:44,382 --> 00:04:46,976
She said it would go away all by itself.

41
00:04:51,502 --> 00:04:53,653
Gaines first contacted me on my cellphone,

42
00:04:53,743 --> 00:04:56,495
directing me to a car
parked at St Mark's Hospital.

43
00:04:56,583 --> 00:05:01,179
- The transmitter was in the car?
- That's when he asked me to put it in my ear.

44
00:05:02,262 --> 00:05:07,257
Can we take a break? Could you find out how
my wife and daughter are doing at the clinic?

45
00:05:07,623 --> 00:05:10,501
- Teri and Kim have already left the clinic.
- What?

46
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:13,256
They're fine.
Nina's moving them to a safe house.

47
00:05:13,344 --> 00:05:16,973
You knew they were moving my wife
and daughter and you didn't tell me?

48
00:05:17,304 --> 00:05:19,772
That's it. This is over.

49
00:05:19,864 --> 00:05:23,334
I don't say another word.
I wanna speak to Chapelle.

50
00:05:24,944 --> 00:05:26,617
Now, Alberta!

51
00:05:36,745 --> 00:05:38,736
You're exhausting.

52
00:05:39,385 --> 00:05:41,615
I was surprised you called last night.

53
00:05:42,265 --> 00:05:45,063
I didn't think I'd see you again after DC.

54
00:05:47,265 --> 00:05:49,859
I'm not really that easy, you know.

55
00:05:51,306 --> 00:05:54,298
Will you have another break later in the day?

56
00:06:01,106 --> 00:06:06,419
The senator has to leave town this afternoon,
and he's going to... Nevada.

57
00:06:07,306 --> 00:06:12,939
Only a few of us were told about it, and I am
one of the ones who has to go with him.

58
00:06:13,746 --> 00:06:16,739
- You have to hold his hand?
- In so many words.

59
00:06:19,827 --> 00:06:23,581
Would it be too much to hope that
you might have some free time in Nevada?

60
00:06:24,707 --> 00:06:26,902
You would wanna come?

61
00:06:26,988 --> 00:06:29,342
If you want me.

62
00:06:47,309 --> 00:06:50,744
This is a pretty big shower.
There's room enough for two.

63
00:06:50,829 --> 00:06:52,820
I'm on my way.

64
00:06:54,188 --> 00:06:56,908
- Alan.
- Senator Palmer, what can I do for you?

65
00:06:56,989 --> 00:06:59,662
I'm trying to talk to
a CTU agent named Jack Bauer.

66
00:06:59,749 --> 00:07:02,389
- Where are you?
- CTU, Los Angeles.

67
00:07:02,469 --> 00:07:05,427
They say I need clearance,
but it's taking forever.

68
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:09,298
- Not a problem. Who's in charge over there?
- Ryan Chapelle.

69
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:12,381
Yeah. OK, I'll take care of this right away.

70
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:14,665
Thank you, Alan. I owe you.

71
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:21,188
Senator Palmer, Ryan Chapelle.

72
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:25,859
What seems to be the problem, Ryan?
Why can't I get in to see Agent Bauer?

73
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:29,626
Please forgive the wait. When an agent
is under internal investigation,

74
00:07:29,711 --> 00:07:33,386
procedure is to keep him isolated
until he's been fully interrogated.

75
00:07:33,471 --> 00:07:36,031
It's... really out of my hands.

76
00:07:36,351 --> 00:07:38,740
Even if I can help you
with your investigation?

77
00:07:38,831 --> 00:07:43,303
Mr. Chapelle? Alan Optican from
the Pentagon's on the line for you.

78
00:07:44,112 --> 00:07:46,103
Excuse me.

79
00:07:46,912 --> 00:07:49,631
- Chapelle.
- This is Optican, Department of Defense.

80
00:07:49,712 --> 00:07:51,145
Yes, sir.

81
00:07:51,232 --> 00:07:55,384
Senator Palmer is to be given carte blanche.
Make sure he gets whatever he needs.

82
00:07:55,473 --> 00:07:56,700
- Yes, sir.
- Understood?

83
00:07:56,792 --> 00:07:59,306
- Of course, sir.
- Thank you.

84
00:07:59,392 --> 00:08:01,987
Bring Jack Bauer down here right away.

85
00:08:08,913 --> 00:08:13,589
Thanks... for helping me...
cut through the red tape.

86
00:08:14,113 --> 00:08:15,546
Mm-hm.

87
00:08:15,634 --> 00:08:19,707
I want all your cameras
and recording equipment shut down.

88
00:08:20,594 --> 00:08:23,427
This is going to be a private conversation.

89
00:08:23,513 --> 00:08:26,711
I understand. I'll make sure
the room is secure.

90
00:08:27,514 --> 00:08:29,505
Thank you.

91
00:08:33,314 --> 00:08:34,747
- Hey, Jack.
- Hey.

92
00:08:35,074 --> 00:08:39,670
Listen, Nina called and wanted me
to tell you that Teri and Kim are fine.

93
00:08:39,755 --> 00:08:42,349
- Who's guardin' the house?
- Paulson and Breeher.

94
00:08:42,434 --> 00:08:43,788
OK, good.

95
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:47,151
Also, Chapelle wants to see you
in the conference room.

96
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:48,827
Good.

97
00:08:51,515 --> 00:08:53,871
- Thanks a lot, Tony.
- You got it.

98
00:09:00,356 --> 00:09:04,474
Milo, I'm sorry I had to switch the cards
on you last night. I had no choice.

99
00:09:04,556 --> 00:09:07,150
We understand what you were goin' through.

100
00:09:07,237 --> 00:09:09,228
Thanks for your help.

101
00:09:18,597 --> 00:09:20,713
Senator Palmer.

102
00:09:20,797 --> 00:09:22,788
Leave us.

103
00:09:24,957 --> 00:09:26,868
- I'll be outside.
- Thank you.

104
00:09:26,957 --> 00:09:28,948
Close the door.

105
00:09:30,037 --> 00:09:31,231
Sit.

106
00:09:31,677 --> 00:09:33,668
Yes, sir.

107
00:09:36,718 --> 00:09:38,948
I wanna know who's working with you.

108
00:09:39,038 --> 00:09:43,953
- In which context, sir? I'm sorry, I don't...
- Right here, right now. We're gonna end this.

109
00:09:44,038 --> 00:09:46,951
- I don't know what they told you...
- I know why you want me dead.

110
00:09:47,038 --> 00:09:50,314
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Kosovo!

111
00:09:52,558 --> 00:09:54,788
- Kosovo?
- I know you hold me responsible

112
00:09:54,878 --> 00:09:59,031
for the men you lost there
two years ago today.

113
00:09:59,119 --> 00:10:03,909
- You know about Operation Nightfall?
- I authorised the mission.

114
00:10:03,999 --> 00:10:08,869
I know you took out Victor Drazen and his
inner circle. And lost six men in the process.

115
00:10:09,119 --> 00:10:11,508
- And you think I want revenge?
- Yes, I do.

116
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:15,309
With all due respect,
I almost died today trying to protect you.

117
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,790
And if I blame anyone for the death
of my men in Kosovo, I blame myself.

118
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,839
- What were you doin' at the power plant?
- I was trying to...

119
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,434
The reason I went for that agent's gun, sir,

120
00:10:28,521 --> 00:10:32,753
was to try and get you out of the room
without giving myself away.

121
00:10:33,721 --> 00:10:36,519
The people that want you dead
had kidnapped my family.

122
00:10:36,601 --> 00:10:41,800
They threatened to kill them if I didn't
assist them in the assassination attempt.

123
00:10:44,001 --> 00:10:48,153
They didn't tell you any of this
when you came in, did they, sir?

124
00:10:48,241 --> 00:10:49,834
No.

125
00:11:00,082 --> 00:11:03,473
It's the truth. You can verify it with Chapelle.

126
00:11:22,884 --> 00:11:27,753
- OK, they're just arriving at the safe house.
- Copy that. Show visual.

127
00:11:36,644 --> 00:11:38,635
This way, Mrs. Bauer.

128
00:11:39,564 --> 00:11:44,400
These are Agents Paulson and Breeher.
They've worked with Jack for many years.

129
00:11:44,925 --> 00:11:47,883
- This is Jack's wife, Teri, and daughter, Kim.
- Hi.

130
00:11:47,965 --> 00:11:50,843
Hi, Kim. Where do you want us?

131
00:11:50,925 --> 00:11:52,916
One in and one out.

132
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:08,364
Well, it's not exactly home,
but it's relatively comfortable.

133
00:12:15,486 --> 00:12:18,444
There are motion detectors every ten yards.

134
00:12:18,526 --> 00:12:23,475
- How long do we have to stay here?
- We'll worry about that after we debrief you.

135
00:12:23,567 --> 00:12:27,958
- Nina, where's the bathroom?
- There's one in each bedroom, through there.

136
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:32,245
If you'd both like to clean up
before we get started, please do.

137
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:20,805
I was the head of the Special Defense
Appropriations Committee in the Senate,

138
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:24,166
which is just a euphemism
for covert operations.

139
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,605
Three years ago,
the CIA brought to my attention

140
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:29,921
atrocities committed by
Victor Drazen in Kosovo.

141
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:34,206
Massacres, torture, ethnic cleansing.

142
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:37,522
The man was a monster,
and was gaining support.

143
00:13:38,371 --> 00:13:43,240
I tried to go through the usual channels, but
I couldn't get anyone to work quickly enough.

144
00:13:43,331 --> 00:13:47,563
So I contacted the one person
I knew who could get the job done,

145
00:13:47,651 --> 00:13:50,450
have him terminated, off the books.

146
00:13:50,531 --> 00:13:53,762
- And that would be Robert Ellis.
- That's right.

147
00:13:55,572 --> 00:13:58,723
Ellis was funded through
a discretionary fund of my committee.

148
00:13:58,812 --> 00:14:03,887
His job was to implement the covert missions
and see to it that no names were leaked.

149
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:07,521
Now we're both on somebody's list.

150
00:14:09,813 --> 00:14:13,248
So this is payback for
what happened that day.

151
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:15,608
It's the only thing that makes sense.

152
00:14:15,693 --> 00:14:19,129
But if someone could put your name
and my name on a list together,

153
00:14:19,213 --> 00:14:23,001
that means they should be
able to find Robert Ellis, too.

154
00:14:23,093 --> 00:14:24,208
You're right.

155
00:14:30,934 --> 00:14:32,925
Four sixes.

156
00:14:36,054 --> 00:14:38,045
Let's see 'em.

157
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:44,128
I knew it! I saw it in your eyes!

158
00:14:44,974 --> 00:14:49,412
If you could read what's in my eyes,
you'd crawl under a rock and cry.

159
00:14:54,215 --> 00:14:56,206
Go again.

160
00:15:02,695 --> 00:15:05,688
- Ellis.
- Bobby, it's David Palmer.

161
00:15:05,776 --> 00:15:09,654
- You gotta be kidding.
- I'm not. I'm here with Jack Bauer.

162
00:15:11,696 --> 00:15:13,493
Get lost.

163
00:15:15,817 --> 00:15:20,765
What are you doin' with Bauer? I went to a lot
of trouble to make sure you two never met.

164
00:15:20,857 --> 00:15:24,565
Someone close to Victor Drazen
seems to have connected us.

165
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:27,535
- Explain.
- Someone wants me dead.

166
00:15:27,616 --> 00:15:30,256
And it appears they want Bauer, too. Today.

167
00:15:30,697 --> 00:15:33,211
The two-year anniversary of Nightfall.

168
00:15:33,297 --> 00:15:36,334
I'm the only one who knows
you both were involved.

169
00:15:36,417 --> 00:15:40,774
Apparently not. And if we're
on the list, it's likely you are, too.

170
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:43,213
- Let me talk to Bauer.
- I'm right here, Bob.

171
00:15:43,498 --> 00:15:46,729
- Jack. You still at CTU?
- Yeah.

172
00:15:47,018 --> 00:15:49,373
To source this we need each other's help.

173
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:53,167
Unfortunately, over the last 12 hours,
I've had to cut a few corners.

174
00:15:53,259 --> 00:15:56,092
I'm being investigated right now.
My hands are tied.

175
00:15:56,178 --> 00:15:59,170
Well, get them untied.
David can help you there.

176
00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:02,490
It has to be someone either
connected to your team...

177
00:16:02,579 --> 00:16:05,855
No. No one on my team knew
of the senator's involvement.

178
00:16:05,939 --> 00:16:08,169
Well, then it has to be Drazen's group.

179
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:14,095
I'll retrieve the closed file on Nightfall. It'll
contain the names of Drazen's associates.

180
00:16:14,179 --> 00:16:17,968
That'll take a few minutes. Meantime,
you need to pick up a trail on the money.

181
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:21,848
Odds are it's funded through Belgium. Can
you get to your K-3 accounts from there?

182
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:24,932
- Yes, if I get reinstated.
- All right, start there.

183
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:29,457
We'll compare names when we talk again.
Where can I reach you?

184
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:31,929
CTU, Los Angeles office.

185
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,578
All right.

186
00:17:19,183 --> 00:17:20,980
Teri?

187
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:24,575
- Yes?
- I put some clean clothes on the bed.

188
00:17:25,704 --> 00:17:27,695
Thank you.

189
00:17:38,623 --> 00:17:42,412
They called me and said you decided
not to fly out. Aren't we going to Nevada?

190
00:17:42,504 --> 00:17:46,975
Apparently not. The senator needed to do
something. He thought we'd be safest here.

191
00:17:47,064 --> 00:17:49,704
- Are you taking a later flight?
- I don't know. I hope so.

192
00:17:49,784 --> 00:17:52,742
Call the Times. Tell them
I'll do that phoner, 45 minutes.

193
00:17:52,825 --> 00:17:54,417
Sure.

194
00:18:10,906 --> 00:18:13,101
- Hello.
- You miss me yet?

195
00:18:13,185 --> 00:18:15,984
- Of course.
- I hope you didn't book your flight to Nevada.

196
00:18:16,065 --> 00:18:19,058
I was just about to. Why?

197
00:18:19,866 --> 00:18:21,936
We might not be going.

198
00:18:22,466 --> 00:18:25,061
- When will you know?
- In about an hour.

199
00:18:27,066 --> 00:18:29,739
If you stay in town,
will you remain at the hotel?

200
00:18:29,826 --> 00:18:33,103
I don't know. They might
switch us for security reasons.

201
00:18:33,187 --> 00:18:35,701
Either way, I'll let you know where I am.

202
00:18:36,347 --> 00:18:39,657
I can still smell your perfume on my skin.

203
00:18:40,387 --> 00:18:42,776
I'll call you as soon as I know.

204
00:18:44,988 --> 00:18:47,182
- Is that the girl?
- Yes.

205
00:18:47,868 --> 00:18:50,461
Palmer might not be leaving after all.

206
00:18:50,748 --> 00:18:53,262
- Better for us.
- Mm-hm.

207
00:18:53,588 --> 00:18:56,227
Was there any problem
getting rid of Gaines's people?

208
00:18:56,308 --> 00:18:57,900
No.

209
00:18:58,868 --> 00:19:02,304
You should never have used him.
I told you it was a mistake.

210
00:19:02,628 --> 00:19:06,417
Fine. You fixed the mistake,
now let's move on.

211
00:19:14,589 --> 00:19:16,659
She looks like Martina.

212
00:19:20,189 --> 00:19:22,385
Our sister's dead, Andre.

213
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:24,862
Leave it alone.

214
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:34,304
- Have you spoken to Jovan and Mishko?
- They have their targets in sight.

215
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:39,101
And as for Palmer, I give you my word
he will be dead by midnight.

216
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:51,424
- Hey. Do you have any toothpaste?
- Yeah, it's right there.

217
00:20:00,871 --> 00:20:05,263
That's nothing. The doctor just
wanted me to take it as a precaution.

218
00:20:11,592 --> 00:20:13,867
You scared me.

219
00:20:13,952 --> 00:20:15,590
Kim.

220
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:17,264
What?

221
00:20:21,032 --> 00:20:23,023
You're pregnant.

222
00:20:28,193 --> 00:20:31,469
I don't understand. What happened today...
How is that possible?

223
00:20:31,553 --> 00:20:35,183
It was Dad, of course,
but a test like this, it takes time before...

224
00:20:35,274 --> 00:20:37,708
You were trying to have a kid
and didn't tell me?

225
00:20:37,793 --> 00:20:40,433
No, honey, it wasn't like that.

226
00:20:40,513 --> 00:20:42,425
Kim. Kim!

227
00:20:43,113 --> 00:20:44,752
- What?
- Please!

228
00:20:44,834 --> 00:20:48,190
This is just as much
a shock to me as it is to you.

229
00:20:48,274 --> 00:20:52,187
Dad and I use birth control.
It's protection, but it's never 100%.

230
00:20:52,275 --> 00:20:54,550
Whatever. You don't need my permission.

231
00:20:54,634 --> 00:20:57,752
I'm not asking for your permission, Kimberly.

232
00:20:59,194 --> 00:21:04,188
Once in a while, you have to think about
what another person is going through.

233
00:21:04,275 --> 00:21:06,744
Honey, I just found out I'm pregnant.

234
00:21:09,115 --> 00:21:11,424
You don't think that terrifies me?

235
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:15,907
Well, it does.

236
00:21:20,476 --> 00:21:21,909
Mom...

237
00:21:21,996 --> 00:21:23,987
I'm sorry.

238
00:21:34,237 --> 00:21:37,547
Are there any other names
on the HK list that you recognise?

239
00:21:37,637 --> 00:21:42,586
- Rich Goen, Michael Redman. That's it.
- No, they weren't cleared until after the op.

240
00:21:42,677 --> 00:21:45,510
- I'll use what we have so far.
- I shouldn't be here.

241
00:21:45,597 --> 00:21:47,907
- Green's got me on priority.
- I cleared it.

242
00:21:48,197 --> 00:21:50,313
- OK, Bob, he's here.
- Milo.

243
00:21:50,917 --> 00:21:53,796
- Yeah. Who are you?
- Don't worry about me.

244
00:21:54,558 --> 00:21:57,755
Ah, I see you opened some sockets up to Ml5.

245
00:21:57,838 --> 00:21:59,987
- How did you know that?
- Doesn't matter.

246
00:22:00,078 --> 00:22:03,195
We're tryin' to hook up some names.
I'm gonna help you.

247
00:22:03,278 --> 00:22:06,350
Now, what's your login ID and password?

248
00:22:06,438 --> 00:22:08,429
Give it to him.

249
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:12,228
The login ID is LFN.

250
00:22:12,919 --> 00:22:16,229
Password's foothill 94022.

251
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:18,310
Lower case.

252
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:20,870
OK, hang on.

253
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:24,957
OK, looks like we got some partial results.

254
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:28,668
- Partial?
- Yeah. Looks like there's something missing.

255
00:22:28,759 --> 00:22:29,908
What do you mean, Bob?

256
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,876
Something's been removed.

257
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:38,235
I'll look into it.

258
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:43,314
Meanwhile, Milo, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna send a file to your server.

259
00:22:45,041 --> 00:22:48,750
Why don't you print out
hard copies for Jack and David?

260
00:22:48,841 --> 00:22:51,230
- Yeah. Sure.
- Thanks, Milo.

261
00:23:05,162 --> 00:23:06,993
All right, here we go.

262
00:23:09,562 --> 00:23:12,030
Feels like I haven't eaten in years.

263
00:23:16,922 --> 00:23:20,632
Feels good, doesn't it?
Not being afraid any more.

264
00:23:20,722 --> 00:23:22,314
Yeah.

265
00:23:25,043 --> 00:23:28,399
I'm sorry, Mom, I was being
really stupid before.

266
00:23:30,563 --> 00:23:32,952
So, when are you gonna tell Dad?

267
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:39,074
You know what?

268
00:23:40,643 --> 00:23:42,634
Right now. Come on.

269
00:23:47,084 --> 00:23:48,676
Um...

270
00:23:57,524 --> 00:24:00,357
- CTU. Almeida.
- Hi, Tony, it's Teri Bauer calling.

271
00:24:00,445 --> 00:24:03,881
- Could I talk to Jack, please?
- Hi, Teri. Actually, it's a bad time.

272
00:24:03,965 --> 00:24:09,358
- He's... he's kinda busy right now.
- Could you tell him to call? It's important.

273
00:24:09,445 --> 00:24:11,083
Sure.

274
00:24:13,005 --> 00:24:17,443
- I really want to hear his reaction.
- I'm so lucky to have you.

275
00:24:17,726 --> 00:24:19,364
Aw, baby.

276
00:24:26,766 --> 00:24:31,282
Hi. Sorry, but we need to start the debrief.
CTU's eager to find out what you know.

277
00:24:31,366 --> 00:24:32,879
- We're ready, huh?
- Yeah.

278
00:24:33,127 --> 00:24:36,721
- Great. I'd like to start with just you, Teri.
- Fine.

279
00:24:40,727 --> 00:24:45,960
- I think I'm gonna go to my room.
- That's a good idea. You should try and rest.

280
00:24:47,967 --> 00:24:51,357
This is standard procedure.
We're gonna put you on videotape.

281
00:24:51,447 --> 00:24:53,245
OK.

282
00:25:21,889 --> 00:25:23,880
- Yeah?
- Hi, Rick?

283
00:25:24,409 --> 00:25:25,398
Hey.

284
00:25:25,489 --> 00:25:27,480
- Kim.
- Are you OK?

285
00:25:28,009 --> 00:25:30,204
Yeah. I just lost a little blood.

286
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:33,168
You need to see a doctor.
You don't sound good.

287
00:25:33,249 --> 00:25:37,687
- I just need a few days' rest.
- Turn yourself in. You can get medical help.

288
00:25:37,769 --> 00:25:40,079
And I'll also get arrested.

289
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:43,401
- But you helped us escape. I'll tell them that.
- No!

290
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:47,760
Don't tell them anything about me.

291
00:25:48,411 --> 00:25:52,882
Well, it's too late. My mom's already being
questioned. They're gonna ask about you.

292
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:55,360
I'm next. I can't lie.

293
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:57,441
OK. Don't.

294
00:25:59,851 --> 00:26:02,924
Tell them that I didn't know
anything about what was goin' on

295
00:26:03,011 --> 00:26:05,730
and that Dan threatened me, he had a gun.

296
00:26:07,811 --> 00:26:10,803
OK, but promise me you'll turn yourself in.

297
00:26:11,811 --> 00:26:16,363
I gotta think this through. I'm not like you,
Kim. I don't come from a good family.

298
00:26:16,452 --> 00:26:21,401
- System's not gonna give me a break.
- It's your only way out of this, Rick.

299
00:26:21,493 --> 00:26:24,484
I brought you to Gaines. That's kidnapping.

300
00:26:25,173 --> 00:26:28,369
They could put me in jail
for the rest of my life.

301
00:26:39,734 --> 00:26:44,284
What's incredible is that none of this has
anything to do with me running for president.

302
00:26:45,693 --> 00:26:49,243
It has nothing to do with... the primary.

303
00:26:51,934 --> 00:26:55,006
It has nothing to do with my being black.

304
00:26:58,734 --> 00:27:02,569
It's just revenge for
taking out... Victor Drazen.

305
00:27:04,054 --> 00:27:05,568
Yes, sir.

306
00:27:10,494 --> 00:27:12,804
- Hello.
- David, it's Sherry.

307
00:27:12,895 --> 00:27:15,967
- Oh, hi. Are you back at the hotel?
- Yes. Where are you?

308
00:27:16,055 --> 00:27:18,569
I'm at CTU, a government agency.

309
00:27:18,655 --> 00:27:20,247
Why?

310
00:27:21,175 --> 00:27:25,772
- There's some things I have to take care of.
- David, what's going on?

311
00:27:26,656 --> 00:27:30,410
I'm trying to find out
who's attempting to kill me, Sherry.

312
00:27:30,496 --> 00:27:34,171
- I've got to go. Wait for me at the hotel. OK?
- OK.

313
00:27:34,256 --> 00:27:35,848
Bye.

314
00:27:41,697 --> 00:27:43,688
Just doesn't stop.

315
00:27:46,177 --> 00:27:48,896
I'm sorry this is happening to you, sir.

316
00:27:52,217 --> 00:27:54,447
You've been detained.

317
00:27:54,537 --> 00:27:56,892
Your family's been kidnapped.

318
00:27:56,977 --> 00:27:59,172
And you're concerned about me.

319
00:28:02,858 --> 00:28:07,648
That didn't have anything to do with
the election. That was about my son.

320
00:28:08,418 --> 00:28:10,773
Is he OK?

321
00:28:10,858 --> 00:28:13,008
I just realised today...

322
00:28:13,898 --> 00:28:16,936
that I haven't always been there for him.

323
00:28:18,818 --> 00:28:20,969
And what's killing me...

324
00:28:22,459 --> 00:28:25,052
is that he's always been there for me.

325
00:28:29,699 --> 00:28:32,497
Being the son of a politician isn't easy.

326
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:37,132
Being a son... or a daughter...

327
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:40,131
or a father...

328
00:28:40,899 --> 00:28:43,050
none of it's easy.

329
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:50,175
Your wife and daughter OK?

330
00:28:52,101 --> 00:28:54,092
I don't know.

331
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:57,971
I hope so.

332
00:29:07,701 --> 00:29:09,976
- OK. Just try to be relaxed.
- OK.

333
00:29:10,062 --> 00:29:12,256
I just have a few questions.

334
00:29:13,261 --> 00:29:16,537
This just came in from Ellis.
I organised it into three sections.

335
00:29:16,622 --> 00:29:21,173
Cross-references are in the first part. Then
there's a summary of Operation Nightfall.

336
00:29:21,262 --> 00:29:23,492
Details that may not be
important are at the end.

337
00:29:23,582 --> 00:29:26,142
- Any word on the missing file?
- No, not yet.

338
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:28,213
OK, thanks, Milo.

339
00:29:32,902 --> 00:29:35,497
What is the Ambassador
to Libya doing on this list?

340
00:29:35,583 --> 00:29:38,574
Probably kept Drazen's money
separate from the government.

341
00:29:38,663 --> 00:29:41,655
We've had our eye on him
for quite some time.

342
00:29:42,303 --> 00:29:44,738
Do you know a Rene Bonniere?

343
00:29:44,823 --> 00:29:47,132
- No. Who's he?
- He's out of North Africa.

344
00:29:47,224 --> 00:29:53,015
A couple high-ups over at District thought he
was trying to set up terrorist cells in the US.

345
00:30:01,664 --> 00:30:03,859
Jack. Page four.

346
00:30:04,144 --> 00:30:06,294
Second paragraph down.

347
00:30:13,464 --> 00:30:15,979
Drazen's wife and daughter
were in the bunker?

348
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:19,899
Did you know about this?
This wasn't in our initial report.

349
00:30:19,985 --> 00:30:22,499
They died in the explosion.

350
00:30:22,585 --> 00:30:24,223
My God.

351
00:30:25,506 --> 00:30:29,783
This is an eye for an eye.
We took out Drazen and his family.

352
00:30:29,866 --> 00:30:32,061
Now someone wants mine.

353
00:30:32,145 --> 00:30:35,138
Who's in charge of protecting your family?

354
00:30:35,826 --> 00:30:39,819
Jack! Who has the authority to add
security to your wife and daughter?

355
00:30:39,906 --> 00:30:41,499
Chapelle.

356
00:30:42,426 --> 00:30:45,259
- Yes, Senator?
- Send in Mr. Chapelle right away.

357
00:30:45,346 --> 00:30:47,337
Yes, sir.

358
00:30:47,906 --> 00:30:51,946
There was nothing else you saw or heard
that gave you a glimpse into their operation?

359
00:30:52,026 --> 00:30:55,906
No, that's it. They really didn't
talk much in front of us.

360
00:30:56,547 --> 00:30:59,186
- Tell me about this boy Rick. He helped you?
- Yeah.

361
00:30:59,268 --> 00:31:00,495
How?

362
00:31:00,587 --> 00:31:05,536
Well, different ways, but mainly
he gave us a gun and he helped us escape.

363
00:31:05,627 --> 00:31:08,426
- How'd he get a gun?
- I don't know.

364
00:31:08,988 --> 00:31:11,137
- And you don't know his last name?
- No.

365
00:31:11,228 --> 00:31:15,380
- I don't think Kimberly knows either.
- How did she meet him?

366
00:31:15,468 --> 00:31:17,777
Through her friend, Janet York.

367
00:31:20,748 --> 00:31:23,421
Everyone used to say
"Wait until she's a teenager,

368
00:31:23,509 --> 00:31:27,547
you'll finally understand
the meaning of the word 'worry'."

369
00:31:27,629 --> 00:31:32,259
I'm sure she'll grow out of it.
Jack says she's basically a level-headed kid.

370
00:31:32,349 --> 00:31:34,544
Jack talks about Kim?

371
00:31:34,629 --> 00:31:37,097
Just the usual stuff.

372
00:31:37,189 --> 00:31:41,866
It surprises me. Jack's work always
seems so serious and secretive.

373
00:31:41,949 --> 00:31:46,704
It's hard to picture him sitting around
the office talking about his family.

374
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:51,386
Sometimes at lunch he'll bring up something
if something's on his mind.

375
00:31:54,990 --> 00:32:00,429
So, do you think Rick had the confidence
of Ira Gaines, the leader of the group?

376
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:02,900
I really couldn't tell you that.

377
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:06,549
- Nina, could I ask you a question?
- Sure.

378
00:32:07,631 --> 00:32:10,020
When Jack and I were separated...

379
00:32:13,351 --> 00:32:15,660
did he ever talk about me?

380
00:32:18,632 --> 00:32:20,907
Jack never discussed his marriage.

381
00:32:21,191 --> 00:32:22,624
Oh.

382
00:32:22,712 --> 00:32:25,624
Sometimes he would... talk about Kim,

383
00:32:25,712 --> 00:32:27,703
you know.

384
00:32:32,953 --> 00:32:36,662
We all knew he was
going through a very hard time

385
00:32:36,753 --> 00:32:39,347
and that he missed you both very much.

386
00:32:44,913 --> 00:32:50,750
When Jack and I got back together again...
he told me that he'd been with someone else.

387
00:32:55,314 --> 00:33:00,182
I told him it didn't matter what I did,
what he did... when we were apart -

388
00:33:00,273 --> 00:33:05,394
that was in the past. The only thing that
mattered was what we did from that point on.

389
00:33:12,634 --> 00:33:14,546
It was you, wasn't it?

390
00:33:17,355 --> 00:33:18,947
Teri.

391
00:33:22,315 --> 00:33:25,512
I saw it... when we got off the helicopter.

392
00:33:27,075 --> 00:33:29,350
I saw it when you looked at him.

393
00:33:42,516 --> 00:33:44,711
After you were separated,

394
00:33:45,436 --> 00:33:48,235
yes, we saw each other.

395
00:33:48,316 --> 00:33:53,470
But it didn't last long. He realised
it was a mistake and he went back to you.

396
00:33:53,557 --> 00:33:56,469
- What about you?
- What about me?

397
00:33:57,596 --> 00:34:00,065
Did you think it was a mistake?

398
00:34:03,797 --> 00:34:06,391
- Are you still sleeping with him?
- No.

399
00:34:06,997 --> 00:34:08,555
Teri...

400
00:34:08,637 --> 00:34:12,472
it was over before he went back to you.
That is the truth.

401
00:34:17,598 --> 00:34:21,717
Look, I realise this is a terrible time
for you to discover all this.

402
00:34:21,798 --> 00:34:24,232
When do you think
a good time would be, Nina?

403
00:34:26,759 --> 00:34:28,750
I'm sorry.

404
00:34:29,479 --> 00:34:32,471
It's just we have to
get through the rest of this.

405
00:34:32,559 --> 00:34:34,708
I need to take a break.

406
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:54,633
Yeah, Mike, I know.
We'll be leaving in about five minutes.

407
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,030
I can't wait for Ellis. I've got to go.

408
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:04,911
Senator, they're not gonna let me continue to
work here. I am technically still under arrest.

409
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:05,876
Come on.

410
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,593
Ryan!

411
00:35:11,201 --> 00:35:14,477
- Yes, Senator?
- I understand you have Jack under arrest.

412
00:35:14,561 --> 00:35:17,029
I told the senator I was being detained.

413
00:35:17,121 --> 00:35:22,435
There is an ongoing crisis that supersedes
any charges that might be filed against him.

414
00:35:23,241 --> 00:35:26,756
- But Senator...
- I want him reinstated immediately.

415
00:35:26,842 --> 00:35:29,640
Sir, you don't have the authority
to make that decision.

416
00:35:29,722 --> 00:35:32,111
Alberta, please.

417
00:35:32,202 --> 00:35:38,277
Sir, what you are asking isn't possible.
The charges against Agent Bauer are serious.

418
00:35:38,362 --> 00:35:43,039
We'd be in contempt of agency regulations
if we reinstated him without a hearing.

419
00:35:43,122 --> 00:35:46,832
Ryan, you don't have to reinstate me.
Not permanently.

420
00:35:46,922 --> 00:35:50,279
Nobody here has as much information
about this situation as I do.

421
00:35:50,363 --> 00:35:53,082
Give me provisional status
till the end of the day.

422
00:35:53,163 --> 00:35:57,122
Then you can take me back into custody,
do whatever you want.

423
00:36:04,164 --> 00:36:06,439
Fine, Jack.

424
00:36:06,524 --> 00:36:10,598
You work the case out of CTU,
but you answer to me.

425
00:36:12,804 --> 00:36:15,638
Good luck with your campaign, Senator.

426
00:36:15,724 --> 00:36:17,680
Thank you.

427
00:36:19,645 --> 00:36:21,636
Walk with me.

428
00:36:25,445 --> 00:36:29,484
Secret Service wants me to leave the state.
They say it's not safe.

429
00:36:29,565 --> 00:36:31,760
Well, I agree with them.

430
00:36:32,846 --> 00:36:37,715
The one thing we know... is that Drazen's
people are here, and they want us today.

431
00:36:38,645 --> 00:36:42,320
And it's almost three o'clock now.
The day is more than half over.

432
00:36:42,406 --> 00:36:44,476
I'm going to stay.

433
00:36:44,566 --> 00:36:47,638
Let's flush them out into
the open and deal with them.

434
00:36:47,726 --> 00:36:49,921
Otherwise you and I and our families

435
00:36:50,007 --> 00:36:53,477
will be looking over our shoulders
for the rest of our lives.

436
00:36:53,567 --> 00:36:57,276
I understand. I'll follow up with Ellis.
I'll keep you posted.

437
00:36:57,367 --> 00:36:59,961
- You know how to get in touch with me.
- Jack.

438
00:37:02,447 --> 00:37:05,041
I'm sorry that I misjudged you.

439
00:37:09,687 --> 00:37:11,678
Thank you, Senator.

440
00:37:14,128 --> 00:37:16,119
Excuse me.

441
00:37:20,528 --> 00:37:24,966
Before my mom came, nobody talked to me.
They put me in the room, I was locked in.

442
00:37:25,048 --> 00:37:28,802
- What about Rick?
- Rick? What about Rick?

443
00:37:28,888 --> 00:37:32,598
- Well, he was one of your kidnappers, right?
- Not exactly.

444
00:37:32,688 --> 00:37:35,157
I thought he and Dan brought you to Gaines?

445
00:37:35,249 --> 00:37:37,922
Well, it was mostly Dan. I mean, not Rick.

446
00:37:38,009 --> 00:37:41,968
I think he was actually just as surprised
as we were about what was happening.

447
00:37:42,049 --> 00:37:43,448
Really?

448
00:37:43,529 --> 00:37:47,044
Well, yeah. He was fighting
with Dan the entire time.

449
00:37:47,129 --> 00:37:49,279
He actually helped us escape.

450
00:37:49,370 --> 00:37:51,565
Hold on. Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

451
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:55,721
Hold on.

452
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:05,881
- Myers.
- Hey, it's me.

453
00:38:05,971 --> 00:38:10,442
Chapelle reinstated me to provisional status
for the rest of the day, at Palmer's request.

454
00:38:10,531 --> 00:38:14,160
- That's great, Jack.
- Yeah. How's everything going over there?

455
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:17,527
- Not bad.
- Look, we're sending over two more teams.

456
00:38:17,611 --> 00:38:20,489
- Why?
- Looks like Teri and Kim were targets as well.

457
00:38:20,571 --> 00:38:24,689
Nina... this is not information
they need to know, OK?

458
00:38:24,772 --> 00:38:27,126
- No, of course.
- Good, thanks.

459
00:38:27,212 --> 00:38:29,441
- Let me speak to Teri, OK?
- Sure.

460
00:38:36,332 --> 00:38:37,560
Teri?

461
00:38:40,452 --> 00:38:42,443
It's Jack.

462
00:38:45,893 --> 00:38:49,283
- Hi, Jack.
- Hey, sweetheart. You OK? How you doin'?

463
00:38:50,653 --> 00:38:52,052
I'm OK.

464
00:38:52,133 --> 00:38:54,124
- How's Kim?
- She's fine.

465
00:38:54,493 --> 00:38:59,521
Tony gave me a message that you
wanted to tell me something important.

466
00:38:59,614 --> 00:39:01,808
No, it's nothing important.

467
00:39:02,853 --> 00:39:05,083
Are you sure? You sound funny.

468
00:39:06,294 --> 00:39:08,330
It's nothing, I just...

469
00:39:08,414 --> 00:39:10,291
I just...

470
00:39:10,374 --> 00:39:12,250
I'm so tired.

471
00:39:12,774 --> 00:39:15,493
Why don't you try and get
some rest, sweetheart?

472
00:39:15,574 --> 00:39:20,045
Listen, if... if you need anything
from the house, Nina will make sure

473
00:39:20,134 --> 00:39:23,332
- someone can go and get it for you, OK?
- Yeah, OK.

474
00:39:24,575 --> 00:39:28,453
I've gotta go. I love you, OK?
I'll call you as soon as I can.

475
00:39:29,055 --> 00:39:31,046
OK. Bye-bye.

476
00:39:46,056 --> 00:39:47,205
Mom!

477
00:39:47,296 --> 00:39:49,287
I'll be right back.

478
00:39:55,416 --> 00:39:58,454
- So, what did he say?
- I didn't tell him.

479
00:39:59,376 --> 00:40:01,844
- Why not?
- It wasn't the right time.

480
00:40:02,737 --> 00:40:05,456
You should go back
and finish with Nina, honey.

481
00:40:05,537 --> 00:40:07,528
What's wrong?

482
00:40:07,977 --> 00:40:12,767
Nothing. I just think you should
finish answering Nina's questions.

483
00:40:18,657 --> 00:40:20,091
Bauer.

484
00:40:20,177 --> 00:40:22,772
- Jack, it's Bob.
- Hey, Bob.

485
00:40:22,858 --> 00:40:27,807
Yeah, I shot over a few more things to Milo,
but I still can't locate the missin' file.

486
00:40:27,898 --> 00:40:32,130
- How can I help?
- I gave Milo enough to try it on your end.

487
00:40:32,219 --> 00:40:37,816
The more I look at this thing, the more I'm
convinced the file was taken out deliberately.

488
00:40:38,698 --> 00:40:43,489
Which leads me to believe...
it contains what we're lookin' for.

489
00:40:43,579 --> 00:40:46,696
Can you give an estimate of
when you think the file was stolen?

490
00:40:46,779 --> 00:40:50,295
Also a list of people you think
could've had access to even get in there?

491
00:40:50,379 --> 00:40:53,212
Not yet, but you tell Milo
I got some ideas on how to...

492
00:40:53,299 --> 00:40:54,334
Urgh!

493
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:56,690
Bob?

494
00:40:58,859 --> 00:41:00,451
Bob?

495
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:05,772
Bob?

496
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:08,291
Can you hear me?

497
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,892
Bob?
