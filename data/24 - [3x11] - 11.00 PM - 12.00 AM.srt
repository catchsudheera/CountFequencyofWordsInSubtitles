1
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,390
You know me well enough
not to be surprised by repercussions.

2
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:22,031
- I hope you're not threatening me.
- I don't make threats. I just tell it like it is.

3
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:26,318
He's showing you that he had the power
to help start your political career,

4
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,436
but he also has the power to end it.

5
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,351
There has to be a way to get to him.

6
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:33,910
- David, what's wrong?
- I need your help.

7
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,232
Hector and Ramón are trying to buy a virus
to use as a weapon.

8
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,878
Millions of people could die.

9
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,032
I've set up this deal
so my government can destroy the virus.

10
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:45,078
- You're still with CTU?
- Yes, I'm still with CTU.

11
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:48,118
I cannot allow this virus
to get into the wrong hands.

12
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:52,671
The virus they're going to buy,
Jack is going to take it from them.

13
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,712
Jack promised to get me and my family
out of here if I help you.

14
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,631
Come on. Move it.

15
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,278
Hurry, hurry.

16
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,192
Bauer's with the Salazar brothers in Mexico.
His transponder signal stopped working.

17
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,840
We're doing all we can to re-establish contact.

18
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,559
Tell the Delta units to hold their position.

19
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,996
There's been a complication.
Another buyer's interested in the virus.

20
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,471
- What? We have a deal.
- We'll auction the virus to the highest bidder.

21
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,755
We found out there's
another player in the deal.

22
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,314
- Who is it?
- Nina Myers.

23
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,392
Your bid is 225 million dollars.

24
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,040
Hers is 240. You win.

25
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,759
- We can get the virus.
- How do you get the virus?

26
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,718
I told you. I know her. I can get to her.

27
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:46,713
The Salazars will pay you at least
ten times more than what you're getting.

28
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,758
Are you going to be able to forgive me
for killing your wife?

29
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,752
If I wanted revenge, Nina,
I would have killed you already.

30
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,673
All I wanna do is finish this deal
and disappear for good.

31
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,591
Convince me.

32
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:14,075
- Adam. Is Amador moving yet?
- No, he's still stopped at the location.

33
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,835
- What do we know about the area?
- It's mostly rural, very few structures.

34
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,230
- Do we have infrared on it?
- Yeah.

35
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,958
It's not high-res satellite.

36
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,033
There are vehicles and bodies nearby.
We have no idea what they are.

37
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,718
Give him space. Make sure he feels
safe enough to take delivery of the virus.

38
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,234
- Got it.
- What's the latest on Chase Edmunds?

39
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:38,598
He phoned his position into the Delta teams
and they're en route to pick him up.

40
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,879
- Edmunds?
- Yeah.

41
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,918
- What's your condition?
- Shot in the hand. But I'm fine.

42
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,912
- What about the others?
- I got two people coming with me.

43
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,719
We spotted a vehicle heading this way.

44
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,236
It's the Salazars. They can't know
CTU is down here. We need to leave now.

45
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,470
Then let's get outta here.

46
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,596
Sergio, we're getting on the chopper.

47
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,035
We're going to a safe place.
Oriol, go right now.

48
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,793
I can't leave her like this.

49
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,959
Hector's coming.
You need to think about your son.

50
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,391
<i>- Bueno. Vámonos.
- We gotta go now.</i>

51
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,040
Let's go! Let's go! Move! Move!

52
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,591
Keep them low! Keep them low!

53
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,389
Give him to me now!
Come on! Stay low! Stay low!

54
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,068
<i>Yes?</i>

55
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,355
Alan, it's Wayne Palmer.

56
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,668
What do you want?

57
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:45,389
I thought you had more balls
than to threaten me through my brother.

58
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,391
What, you can't talk to me man to man?

59
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,233
I don't owe you an explanation.
You slept with my wife.

60
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:55,553
- That's between you and me, Alan.
- Fine. Step down and it all goes away.

61
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,234
- That's not your decision.
- We'll see.

62
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,754
Wayne.

63
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,115
Who you talking to?

64
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,475
Alan Milliken.

65
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,870
- What the hell do you think you're doing?
- Cleaning up my own mess.

66
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,913
- Hello, Alan.
- Mr President.

67
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,639
That brother of yours
is going to be your undoing.

68
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,792
<i>- I am not firing my brother.
- That's too bad.</i>

69
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,474
I have no intention
of losing my healthcare bill.

70
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,154
I spent two years putting it together.

71
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,118
Except you're three votes short,
the last I checked.

72
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,794
You better brace yourself
for some disappointment.

73
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,348
I don't wanna go to war with you, Alan.

74
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,431
It's your choice, Mr President.

75
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:42,069
The choice is unacceptable.
There has to be another way to work this out.

76
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,277
On any other issue I'd bend over backwards
to accommodate you.

77
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,111
Not on this one.

78
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:51,112
You have only yourself to blame
for the consequences.

79
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,909
And I promise you... you won't like them.

80
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,354
- When's Sherry getting here?
- Five minutes.

81
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,078
Good.

82
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,071
Sure you want to bring her into this?

83
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,357
We're in a street fight, Wayne.
It's what she does best.

84
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,910
And we both have to focus
on what's happening in Mexico.

85
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,391
I know we're hoping for success,
but we have to anticipate failure.

86
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,233
If Jack Bauer does not intercept the virus,

87
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:23,596
then we are dealing
with an international crisis.

88
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,598
This is Michael Amador. He's representing
the Ukrainians in the sale of the virus.

89
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:33,071
We have a Delta team tracking him
on the ground at a safe distance.

90
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,196
Why don't they just get Amador now?

91
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,558
He may not be carrying the virus, and
we'd blow our chance at the interception.

92
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:43,599
Once Jack confirms it is the virus,
the Delta teams will go in and secure it.

93
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,878
- Delta asked for a photo of the woman...
- Adam, wait.

94
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,635
Nina Myers is the broker?

95
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:58,070
- Didn't you read the ops brief?
- No.

96
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,397
Kim, come with me.

97
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,600
- Would you finish the briefing?
- Yeah.

98
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:15,316
I'm sorry.
I was looking for the right time to tell you.

99
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,597
I cannot believe
Nina Myers is involved in this.

100
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:22,355
Your father needed her help
to secure the virus.

101
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,749
She killed my mother.

102
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,240
My father couldn't even pretend
to work with her.

103
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,355
I'm sorry, Jack.

104
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,149
I'm sorry, Jack.

105
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,672
I wanted to think you'd changed,
but I can feel it.

106
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,551
You're lying.

107
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,234
You haven't forgotten anything, have you?

108
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,438
You despise me.

109
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,472
You'd do anything
to get me to go along with your plan.

110
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,076
- It's not true.
- It is true.

111
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,600
I know you're still with CTU.

112
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,150
So why would I let you set me up?

113
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:43,192
You know what?
You can believe whatever you want.

114
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,912
I need this deal to happen.
I'm a fugitive. I don't have a choice.

115
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,073
I need the Salazars to pay me for the virus
and Amador will only deal with you.

116
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,754
Do you understand me?

117
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,117
I'll honor your original deal.
You'll get your 20 million dollars.

118
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,430
And you get to keep breathing.

119
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,909
Until my client doesn't get what he paid for.

120
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,278
Right now your client
should be the least of your worries.

121
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,910
Hector. She's dead.

122
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,071
Get away from her.

123
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,990
Claudia.

124
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,948
Claudia.

125
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,630
They can't be far away. Find them.

126
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,119
Find them!

127
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,193
Find them!

128
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:45,392
The Mexican authorities are pissed off
that we didn't notify them earlier.

129
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,274
It's Hector.

130
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:55,637
- You set?
- Go.

131
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,275
- Yeah.
- It's me.

132
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,396
Edmunds escaped.
He killed three of my men.

133
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,835
<i>Has he contacted CTU?</i>

134
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,480
Not yet. But he may not call.

135
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,836
<i>I found out Edmunds is rogue.
He's been acting on his own.</i>

136
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,150
CTU hasn't sent anyone down here
to find him?

137
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,516
They don't even know where he is.

138
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,994
<i>- You call me the second you hear from him.
- I will.</i>

139
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,316
- Yeah.
- Are you still with Bauer?

140
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:33,870
I'm at the main road into town,
waiting for Bauer to bring the woman.

141
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,038
- We have to call this off.
- What are you taking about?

142
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,759
The CTU agent, Edmunds, he escaped.

143
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,400
- How?
- I don't know. Claudia was with him.

144
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:48,312
Ramón... she's dead.

145
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:54,708
I'm sorry.
But, Hector, we still have business to do.

146
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,236
Not with Edmunds on the loose.
When he gets to a phone, he'll call CTU.

147
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,312
- Find him before that happens.
- I am trying, but it's too dark.

148
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,233
- He'll be impossible to track.
- What do you suggest we do?

149
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,072
Forget it. It's too dangerous.

150
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,071
- It always has been.
- Not like this.

151
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,151
You were the one who made this deal.

152
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,390
You promised our buyers
what we can't deliver.

153
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:17,429
If you don't keep your promise, my reputation
will be ruined. Do you understand?

154
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,036
I understand.

155
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:26,717
Keep some of your men looking for Edmunds
and bring the rest here so we can do the deal.

156
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,437
- Yes.
- Ramón, it's Jack.

157
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,909
<i>- Everything clear outside?
- Yes.</i>

158
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,309
I need you to come back to the building.

159
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:45,633
- Did the woman agree to work with us?
- I'll explain when you get here.

160
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,151
<i>Yes.</i>

161
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,872
- Mr President.
- Yes, Aaron?

162
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,394
Sherry Palmer is here.

163
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,879
Show her in.

164
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,639
Thank you.

165
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,759
- Hello, Sherry.
- David.

166
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,751
Thank you, Aaron.

167
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:45,913
- Please, have a seat.
- No, thank you. I... I'd rather stand.

168
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:55,149
- So, how are things with Anne?
- They're fine.

169
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,754
Good. I'm glad.

170
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,870
You, uh...

171
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,952
You deserve a little bit of happiness.

172
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,632
Thank you.

173
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:09,508
You're looking well, but somehow different.

174
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,353
- A little older.
- No, it's not that.

175
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,471
- You look calm.
- Um... tired, maybe.

176
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,870
But I'm not sure exactly how calm.

177
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:29,999
I know these last three years
have been difficult.

178
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:37,311
Well... not as difficult
as they could have been.

179
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,830
And I have you to thank for that.

180
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,629
You kept me out of prison,
away from public humiliation.

181
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,155
I... I lost a lot.

182
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:57,552
But most of it, I discovered,
really wasn't that important to begin with.

183
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:01,796
Which surprised me. Imagine that.

184
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,914
- What? What's funny?
- No, nothing, really.

185
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:16,789
It's just that when I wanted you to pull back
and just let things be, you were a shark.

186
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,275
Now that I've asked you back,
I need you to be a shark.

187
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:26,877
I can still be whatever you need me to be.

188
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,351
Thank you.

189
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:41,192
So you say you're having
some kind of trouble with Milliken?

190
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:44,590
Yes. I am.

191
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:50,671
OK. Tell me all about it.

192
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,955
Handcuffs?
I thought you were going to gain her trust.

193
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:21,079
I will. It's just going to take
a little longer than I hoped.

194
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:29,353
She'll do the exchange.
That's what's important.

195
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,079
- When is it happening?
- As soon as Amador calls.

196
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,516
Amador better call soon.
We might not have much time.

197
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,989
Your partner escaped.

198
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,832
- You should have let me kill him.
- Yes, I should have.

199
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,156
For some reason Claudia was with him.
She ended up dead.

200
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,989
What are you talking about? How?

201
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,548
Hector didn't say.

202
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,988
Tell Hector I'm sorry.

203
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:06,072
Tell him yourself when he gets here.

204
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:20,077
Nina, I need you
to open up this transaction file.

205
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,312
Amador's gonna wanna verify
your client's funds.

206
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,151
Now!

207
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,317
The bottom line is,
Alan's determined to see Wayne removed.

208
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,755
Even if it means destroying my presidency.

209
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,991
- You've tried to work this out peacefully?
- Of course.

210
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:52,392
Alan wouldn't budge.
In Alan's mind, it's a matter of pride.

211
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:57,395
So you want me to find something
you can use against Alan?

212
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:03,388
I've always known
you knew things about Alan

213
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:07,792
that you didn't tell me
because of my friendship with him.

214
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:11,236
And I've always known
you were too smart to ask.

215
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,589
Well, I guess we're both right.

216
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,439
Alan does have skeletons in his closet
that he would guard at any cost.

217
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,429
One in particular comes to mind.

218
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,830
But I must warn you, David. It's a big one.

219
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,874
What is it?

220
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,838
All you need to know
is that if you play this card,

221
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:36,357
you and Alan Milliken
will be enemies for the rest of your life.

222
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:42,638
As far as I'm concerned, our friendship ended
when he tried to extort me.

223
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,752
Then I can help you.

224
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,877
Our insertion points are here and here.

225
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,638
Claudia's dead. Why did she die?

226
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,191
So we could be safe.

227
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,717
Your sister was very brave, Sergio.

228
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,629
We don't have to worry
about Hector no more.

229
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,152
But I like Hector.

230
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,598
Yes, sir. Yes, sir, will do.

231
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,359
Copy that.

232
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:36,473
- That's good enough. Give it to me.
- I'm not finished.

233
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,873
Reiss, what's going on?

234
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,396
With the Salazars after us, CTU
wants me to pull back my surveillance team.

235
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,552
- We can't lose Amador.
- CTU's tracking him through his phone.

236
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,710
He can dump his phone.
We need visual.

237
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,598
Don't worry about that.
It's not your problem any more.

238
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:54,229
Don't tell me it's not my problem!
It's been my problem for the last year!

239
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,914
Look, Edmunds, you need medical attention.

240
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,833
We're evacuating you
with the boy and his father now.

241
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,911
I'm not going anywhere.

242
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,992
- Mr Chappelle.
- Yeah.

243
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,038
I'm picking up heat signatures
moving in on Amador's position.

244
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,680
- Ground vehicles?
- From the speed it looks like it.

245
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,513
- This may be the virus.
- What protocols do you want me on?

246
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:17,194
- Shall I contact the Delta teams?
- Put them on alert.

247
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:21,193
Make sure they don't approach until Amador
meets Bauer. We want a visual on the virus.

248
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,191
OK. Got it.

249
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,031
Sherry.

250
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,231
Wayne.

251
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,118
What are you doing in here?

252
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,953
I'm waiting for them
to prepare an office for me.

253
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:38,715
It's good to see you, Sherry, but to be blunt,

254
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,916
I don't think your being here is a good idea.

255
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,835
Of course you don't. That's because
this is all about your indiscretion with Julia.

256
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:48,070
- Sherry.
- I say that with no judgment.

257
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:51,675
Of course. You're the last person
who's in a position to pass judgment.

258
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,672
OK, let's not play this.
We're both too good at it.

259
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,508
So, what do you want me to hear?

260
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:06,394
- I appreciate you coming to help David...
- No, no, no. Skip that part.

261
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,916
That's right. I forgot that about you.

262
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:16,555
Listen, Sherry, do whatever it is
that you do around here for a few hours.

263
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,713
But then tell David you were unable to find
anything that he could use on Milliken.

264
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:27,638
Hm. You know, if I do that,
the only way out of this is if you resign.

265
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,631
Which is what I wanna do.

266
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:32,632
David doesn't want that,
and frankly, neither do I.

267
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:37,111
- Sherry, why do you care?
- Because David needs someone like me.

268
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,634
Someone who sees things
the way they really are,

269
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,951
who's not afraid
to throw a punch every now and then.

270
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:47,079
It's obvious I can't play that role any more,
but you can.

271
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:54,114
No, Wayne, I feel good knowing David's got
you and I'm gonna make sure he keeps you.

272
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,714
So save your breath, I'm gonna fix this

273
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:00,839
and you are gonna make sure
your brother gets re-elected.

274
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,234
Fine.

275
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:11,197
But, Sherry, don't you forget
how dangerous Alan Milliken can be.

276
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,430
Oh, I won't forget.

277
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:20,671
I'm afraid you're the one who forgot, when
you decided to get involved with his wife.

278
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:27,758
We haven't heard from Jack in over an hour,
but our Delta teams are on standby.

279
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:32,231
<i>We're monitoring from here. You'll
advise us of any changes. I'll let him know.</i>

280
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,231
All right, good.

281
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,153
Do you have any more information
on Nina Myers?

282
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,231
No, not yet.

283
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,754
Look, Kim, I know it's hard,

284
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:46,469
but you're gonna have to
put your feelings aside till all this is over.

285
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,790
How can I put my feelings aside?

286
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,189
How can my father put his feelings aside?

287
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,432
I've spent the last three years knowing
that the woman who killed my mother

288
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,909
was pardoned by the president.

289
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:08,469
And that she's out there... living her life.

290
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,991
And it's wrong.

291
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,991
I know.

292
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,470
She's violating her pardon.
She's buying and selling the virus.

293
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,630
- Kim.
- We cannot let her get away this time.

294
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:24,589
- Let's not get ahead of ourselves here.
- Please. She has to pay for what she's done.

295
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:32,032
Promise me when this is all over,
you'll at least help make that happen.

296
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,277
<i>- Yeah.
- Tony, this is Chloe.</i>

297
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,191
<i>- Is Kim in there?
- Yeah.</i>

298
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,840
<i>- I need her.
- All right, she's on her way.</i>

299
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,997
Kim.

300
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,669
I'll do what I can.

301
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,671
Thank you.

302
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,917
<i>Shh. It's OK.</i>

303
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,798
<i>Good girl. Nice and warm.</i>

304
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,872
<i>- Yes?
- Chloe, where are the index keys for Salazar?</i>

305
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,349
<i>- Who is this?
- Patrick in Com One.</i>

306
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:13,238
You guys aren't authorized
to access those keys.

307
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:16,232
<i>- I'll come and do it for you.
- I'm trying to save some time.</i>

308
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,788
<i>- I'll be down in a minute.
- Fine.</i>

309
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,674
Chloe. You wanted me?

310
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:28,197
Michelle needs me to brief people in Division,
then I have to give index keys to Com One.

311
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:32,751
I need you to watch some things for me.
Can you do your work from my station?

312
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,831
- Yeah, I guess so.
- Good. This is Angela.

313
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:38,276
She's been fed, so she'll sleep.
If she gets fussy, put that in her mouth.

314
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,237
But you can't have a baby in here!

315
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:44,950
Chappelle thinks I had someone pick her up,
so if he comes up, just keep her hidden.

316
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,838
- Yeah, but I can't...
- I'll be back in 15 minutes.

317
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,196
Ramón.

318
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,556
Jack's not who you think he is.

319
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:15,553
- Is that right?
- He's working with CTU. He's setting you up.

320
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:18,473
Do you think
that my brother and I are that stupid?

321
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:21,358
We made sure that he's acting alone.

322
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,159
Don't you even think
of undermining this deal.

323
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:32,438
Hey, Jack. I think it's Amador.

324
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:43,350
Put this phone on speaker.
You say one wrong word and he will kill you.

325
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,351
You understand?

326
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,636
Go.

327
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,870
- Hello.
- I've got the product.

328
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,872
- Are you ready to show me your account?
- Yes.

329
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:57,919
- We agreed you'd provide audit privileges.
- Yes. Tell me your routing number.

330
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,516
77509210.

331
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:06,912
Account number 45508996.

332
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,510
OK.

333
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,754
The funds are in that account,
ready to be transferred?

334
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,751
Yeah.

335
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,951
There's an old mine east of Posta Mita.

336
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,998
Meet me at the northernmost building
in an hour and ten minutes.

337
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:28,517
I'll have one man with me for security.
You may do the same.

338
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:34,069
Good. We'll leave as soon as Hector arrives.

339
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:08,875
Yuri.

340
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,433
Amador's on the move.

341
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,238
- What direction?
- East.

342
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,878
Likely destination?

343
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,793
There's half a dozen villages.
It could be any one of them.

344
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,950
With all due respect, Adam was right.

345
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,793
We should order Delta Team
to move in and arrest Amador.

346
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,156
If the virus isn't under Amador's control,
we could lose it.

347
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,232
- We gotta wait for Jack's confirmation.
- How will he let us know?

348
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,754
The Salazars are watching him. He can't call.

349
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,796
I don't know. He'll find a way.

350
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:13,273
Shouldn't we inform the Mexican government
what it is we're doing on their soil?

351
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,477
No. I don't wanna risk
compromising the operation.

352
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,630
You should call the president yourself.

353
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:23,350
Once he understands what kind of threat
this virus poses, he should ease up.

354
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,032
Yes.

355
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,510
Sir, Alan Milliken
is holding for you on line five.

356
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,511
Thank you, Aaron.

357
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,318
- Yes, Alan.
- What the hell do you think you're doing?

358
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,678
- What are you talking about?
- Don't screw with me, David.

359
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,954
I didn't pick this fight.

360
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:48,191
You think you can enlist
your psychopathic ex-wife

361
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:51,955
to manufacture lies to bring me down?
It's not going to happen.

362
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:56,670
You want it to stop, stay away
from my healthcare bill and my brother.

363
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:00,548
You've got it backwards. Your brother
should have stayed away from my wife.

364
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,279
- Come on, Alan, it's over.
- Really?

365
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:06,557
I'm looking at photographs
of her and Wayne together an hour ago.

366
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,638
He was trying to convince her
to talk some sense into you.

367
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:19,277
I'm warning you, David. Pull Sherry off this,
or the bill will be the least of your problems.

368
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:27,318
- Alan's scared.
- Alan is most dangerous when he's scared.

369
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,789
Mm-hm.

370
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:38,271
Tell the Mexican ambassador
that I'll be calling his president directly.

371
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,430
- She's still out of town.
- I heard you the first time. I'm not deaf.

372
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:58,436
I understand she's away. I want to talk to her
about Chagrin Falls and give her this number.

373
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,909
- All right.
- Thank you.

374
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,910
- Yes, David?
- I just got off the phone with Alan Milliken.

375
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:12,556
The blowback happened quickly, huh?
I guess he was pretty upset.

376
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:17,395
- What have you been up to?
- Exactly what you asked me to do.

377
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,791
I'm fighting back.

378
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:24,074
What's Chagrin Falls
and what happened there?

379
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:28,471
It's something that Alan wants to keep buried.

380
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:31,313
I'm gonna tell you everything,
but not just now.

381
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:35,871
I got a lot to get done in a very short period
of time if I'm gonna pull this off for you.

382
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,270
All right.

383
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:43,195
Across from the opening of the mine
there's enough cover to hide your men.

384
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:46,033
<i>All right, good.</i>

385
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:50,599
- Did you find Edmunds?
- No. It's too dark to find him.

386
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,557
You don't need to look for Edmunds.

387
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:56,428
Even if he contacted CTU, they don't have
time to get here before the deal happens.

388
00:31:56,520 --> 00:32:01,435
- What makes you so sure they're not here?
- Didn't Gael say Edmunds came down alone?

389
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:08,077
Why is she tied up?
Bauer said he's going to buy her cooperation.

390
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,069
Don't worry. She'll do what she's told.

391
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:21,358
Ramón, can I speak to you in private?

392
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:31,154
- What is it?
- This is not the plan. I don't like it.

393
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:34,391
I know you are upset about Claudia,
but there's no reason to panic.

394
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,516
I'm not panicking, I'm being sensible.

395
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:39,751
- This was your deal in the first place.
- And you were against it.

396
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,590
You was right and I was wrong.

397
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:47,117
Edmunds escapes, Claudia is dead,
now this woman goes only along at gunpoint.

398
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,431
- It doesn't feel right.
- We don't have a choice.

399
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:53,512
The buyers are waiting for this deal to happen
because of you.

400
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:57,957
- Ramón, things are not going as planned.
- The plans have changed.

401
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,275
CTU, Dessler.

402
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,238
We are following through
with what you have started.

403
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,753
Hello?

404
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,159
They aren't...

405
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:11,870
Ramón, I'm sorry to interrupt, but if you want
this deal to happen, we gotta go now.

406
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:14,633
Tony! Jack's on the line.
He's using his cell as a one-way.

407
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,631
Put it on speaker.

408
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,950
<i> Amador will be at the mine in an hour.</i>

409
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:22,510
It's gonna take us that long to get there
and get your men into position.

410
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:27,799
Bauer's right. Our men need to be in place
before Amador gets there.

411
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:34,157
- I still haven't signed off on this.
- You do what I tell you to do.

412
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:41,271
Now call your men and tell them
to be at the village outside the mine.

413
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,433
Dammit! My battery.

414
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:47,229
- Hey, Jack, where's the other phone?
- Got it here.

415
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:55,118
- It's disconnected.
- They told us what we need to know.

416
00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:00,194
Get the Delta teams in position. Set up a
quarantine zone in case the virus gets out.

417
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,352
<i> Bauer made it through.</i>

418
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:08,069
<i>The deal is going down near a mine
just outside of Posta Mita in 55 minutes.</i>

419
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:12,950
<i>- How long until you can mobilize?
- We've got the coordinates. Moving now.</i>

420
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,992
- Your men are mobilizing.
- They will be 3km from the strike zone.

421
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:19,594
- How did you find out where?
- Bauer got through.

422
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:21,352
It's going down in 55 minutes.

423
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:25,353
- You're keeping your men three clicks away?
- We're keeping them out of sight.

424
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,635
How will you know
the package contains the virus?

425
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:29,631
I'm sending in a forward observer.

426
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:32,951
- Have you picked anyone yet?
- No, not yet.

427
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,239
I'll do it.

428
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:38,949
- We got people trained for that, Edmunds.
- I'm trained for it too.

429
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,270
Besides, I know the Salazars, remember?

430
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:44,397
- Your hand.
- This isn't combat, it's observation.

431
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,198
All right.

432
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:50,558
Trell, gear this man up
with the surveillance package.

433
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:03,117
- Get over it, Hector.
- Not until you respect what I have to say.

434
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,636
- The Americans could be hiding anywhere.
- There's no more time to argue.

435
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,312
Stop talking down to me!

436
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,518
Did you already forget the only reason
you are here is because of me?

437
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:15,512
- Who got you out of prison?
- Bauer got me out. Not you.

438
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:18,478
Now that I'm out, you take orders from me,
like you always have.

439
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,313
- Ramón...
- It's over, Hector. No more talking.

440
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,271
We're gonna do the deal now.

441
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:29,274
Bauer! Get her in the car.

442
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:33,354
You can't control this, Jack.

443
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,351
Just get in the car.

444
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,111
<i>Hombres, vámonos.</i>

445
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,277
<i>What's the matter?</i>

446
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:03,113
Please don't cry. Shh, it's OK.

447
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,839
<i>Shh.</i>

448
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,718
- What did you do to her?
- I didn't do anything to her.

449
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,791
You must have done something.

450
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:14,475
Chloe, look, I promise you,
I didn't do anything to her.

451
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:18,633
I'm gonna redirect all my files back
down to my desk. I'm finished with this.

452
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:22,838
Jack and Nina are meeting Amador
in 53 minutes in a place called Posta Mita.

453
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:26,356
- What about Delta Force?
- They've established a perimeter of 3km.

454
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:29,034
<i>What the hell is that?</i>

455
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,076
Dammit. I told her.

456
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:35,511
Michelle, you take care of this, please.

457
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:41,508
- That's it, Chloe. You're out of here.
- I said I didn't have anyone to watch her.

458
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,239
You'll watch her.
I gave you a warning. You're suspended.

459
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,312
- It was a verbal warning only.
- Ryan.

460
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:53,516
- What?
- Jack's meeting Amador in less than an hour.

461
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,955
We have no visual satellite coverage
of that area.

462
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,315
What does that have to do with this baby?

463
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:02,473
We have to use digitally enhanced audio
coverage. Chloe is the best we have at that.

464
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:06,155
You're telling me we have to let
this woman raise her child in our office

465
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,958
because no one can do her job?

466
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:11,874
Maybe we should deal with
Chloe's childcare problems on another day.

467
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,795
OK, thatta girl.

468
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,989
I have work to do.
Who's gonna look after my child?

469
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,680
- Give her to Kim.
- What?

470
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,197
Based on what CTU got from Jack,
the meeting will take place here,

471
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,191
by an old mine north of town.

472
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,271
My position is gonna be here.

473
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:39,035
I need you to put your men behind this ridge
until we know that the virus is real.

474
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,634
Good natural cover. That'll work.

475
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:45,759
- How long will it take your men to get there?
- 90 seconds.

476
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:48,195
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

477
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:31,598
- Where are the rest of the men?
- Felipe brought everyone.

478
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,877
- There's not enough.
- Amador is only bringing one man.

479
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,393
So he says.

480
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,438
- Stop making problems.
- I'm making sure we are covered.

481
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,988
You want to stop this
because you lost your nerve.

482
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:45,311
Things are moving fast.
We haven't had time to think them through.

483
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:48,073
- We'll be fine.
- That doesn't mean we'll be fine.

484
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,913
The situation is difficult enough.
Don't make it worse.

485
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:55,788
Or what?

486
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,838
Ramón, if you want this deal to happen,
we have to leave now.

487
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,036
We have to be there
20 minutes before Amador.

488
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,554
The deal is off!

489
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,951
All right.

490
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:29,996
- Hector, we're not done here.
- I've said what I need to say.

491
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:32,389
Listen to me, Hector.
Listen to me carefully.

492
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,789
If we don't give our buyers
what you promised,

493
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:37,997
we won't just lose money, we'll lose respect.

494
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,915
And without that, we have nothing.

495
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,111
We'll have our lives.

496
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,350
We're leaving now.

497
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,113
<i>Pablo, Felipe, vámonos.</i>

498
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,791
Now!

499
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:09,272
Hector, don't do this.

500
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,351
Hector!

501
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,916
Hector!

502
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,511
Hector!
