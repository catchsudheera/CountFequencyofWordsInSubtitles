1
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:21,822
- Your wife survived the attack.
- Thank God.

2
00:00:21,914 --> 00:00:25,350
I should never have given in.
I should have ordered back the motorcade.

3
00:00:25,434 --> 00:00:27,232
The attack failed.

4
00:00:27,315 --> 00:00:32,514
We have to assume they'll make good their
threat to use the Sentox on American soil.

5
00:00:32,876 --> 00:00:35,710
Sorry. I made a mistake.
I didn't think I had any choice.

6
00:00:35,796 --> 00:00:38,913
Charles. You didn't stand up to them.

7
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:42,388
- You saved my life.
- Well, you're welcome.

8
00:00:42,478 --> 00:00:46,187
The country's lucky
to have men like you. I'm lucky.

9
00:00:46,278 --> 00:00:47,836
Mrs. Logan.

10
00:00:49,638 --> 00:00:54,110
Henderson set up the deal that allowed
the terrorists to gain control of the Sentox.

11
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,519
<i>He left me for dead.</i>

12
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,398
<i>Henderson is our primary link.</i>

13
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,153
You are gonna tell me now
how to find the rest of the gas.

14
00:01:00,241 --> 00:01:02,436
Go ahead and do it, Jack.
Get it done. Shoot me.

15
00:01:04,242 --> 00:01:08,236
- Oh, you son of a bitch!
- I shot her above the knee. She can still walk.

16
00:01:08,322 --> 00:01:10,757
If you make me shoot her again,
she'll be in a wheelchair.

17
00:01:10,843 --> 00:01:13,277
- Tell him what he wants to know.
- I can't.

18
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:17,642
I'm bringing Christopher Henderson into
CTU. I need an interrogation room prepped.

19
00:01:18,165 --> 00:01:21,123
I don't care that you took my wallet.
I just need to get my key card back.

20
00:01:21,204 --> 00:01:24,038
It's of no value to you,
it just lets me in this building.

21
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:27,163
You told me we were gonna take his cash
and a credit card.

22
00:01:27,246 --> 00:01:32,526
That's how I'm getting us all this money.
A $20,000 line of credit right here.

23
00:01:32,607 --> 00:01:34,438
Who's gonna pay you that kind of money?

24
00:01:40,529 --> 00:01:43,646
- I have the key card.
- How long will it take you to reprogram it?

25
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:47,927
Five minutes.
Then we will be able to use it to access CTU.

26
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:50,001
Good.

27
00:02:54,342 --> 00:02:55,332
<i>Yes?</i>

28
00:02:55,423 --> 00:02:59,257
- I'm reprogramming the CTU key card now.
- Will it work?

29
00:02:59,343 --> 00:03:04,054
I need to change the ID but preserve
McGill's executive entry privileges.

30
00:03:04,144 --> 00:03:06,135
- It won't be a problem.
- Good.

31
00:03:06,225 --> 00:03:09,774
Our couriers are delivering
the canisters to the targets.

32
00:03:09,865 --> 00:03:13,859
- When are you launching the attacks?
- After you're done at CTU.

33
00:03:13,946 --> 00:03:17,019
<i>- I'm a few minutes out.
- Call me when you're there.</i>

34
00:03:17,107 --> 00:03:19,177
Understood.

35
00:03:28,309 --> 00:03:31,028
<i>We neutralised
the attack on the hospital.</i>

36
00:03:31,109 --> 00:03:35,979
Good. Do we have any idea
what the terrorists' next target might be?

37
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:41,225
We're working with state authorities to harden
security around the highest-value targets.

38
00:03:41,311 --> 00:03:45,703
In other words, no. We're just sitting around
waiting for Bierko to hit us again.

39
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:48,101
We do have one promising lead, sir.

40
00:03:48,192 --> 00:03:52,789
Jack Bauer was able to recapture the man
who escaped, Christopher Henderson.

41
00:03:52,873 --> 00:03:57,994
Henderson was a defence contractor who
brokered the sale of the nerve gas to Bierko.

42
00:03:58,074 --> 00:04:01,112
Is this the same Christopher Henderson
who worked at CTU?

43
00:04:01,195 --> 00:04:04,949
He was head of field ops. Jack brought him
down on corruption charges.

44
00:04:05,035 --> 00:04:08,426
And this Henderson knows
how to find Bierko?

45
00:04:08,516 --> 00:04:14,035
We believe so. He's not cooperating. Jack's
bringing him in for further interrogation.

46
00:04:14,117 --> 00:04:17,190
- Keep me posted on any progress.
- Yes, sir.

47
00:04:18,318 --> 00:04:21,594
Mr. Buchanan. Tony Almeida's
been asking to see you down in the clinic.

48
00:04:21,679 --> 00:04:23,988
Tell him I'll get to him as soon as I can.

49
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:27,196
And Ms Raines, Kim Bauer is here.

50
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,595
She's just clearing Security.

51
00:04:36,601 --> 00:04:41,153
- Put her in the field ops office, please.
- Yes, ma'am.

52
00:04:50,124 --> 00:04:55,643
What's Kim Bauer doing here?
- Jack asked me to call her.

53
00:04:55,725 --> 00:04:57,920
Does she know?

54
00:04:58,005 --> 00:05:00,121
Not yet.

55
00:05:00,206 --> 00:05:06,203
Who's with her?
- I don't know, but I'll find out from Security.

56
00:05:12,688 --> 00:05:14,884
<i>- This is Bauer.
- Hey, it's me.</i>

57
00:05:14,968 --> 00:05:19,485
- Is Burke prepped for the interrogation?
- Yes.

58
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:22,403
Jack, Kim just arrived at CTU.

59
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:25,051
<i>- What did you say to her?
- Nothing yet.</i>

60
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:28,043
Good. I want her to hear it from me.

61
00:05:28,131 --> 00:05:34,446
Jack, it might be easier for her if she knows
that you're alive before she sees you.

62
00:05:34,533 --> 00:05:38,128
- When I first saw you... It-it's just...
- Yeah, I know.

63
00:05:38,773 --> 00:05:41,208
I- I understand.

64
00:05:42,934 --> 00:05:45,324
Look, when you talk to her,

65
00:05:45,414 --> 00:05:49,728
explain that I couldn't tell her I was still alive
cos I was trying to protect her.

66
00:05:49,815 --> 00:05:53,013
<i>- Of course I will.
- Audrey, thank you.</i>

67
00:05:57,577 --> 00:05:59,772
Kim's at CTU right now.

68
00:06:01,818 --> 00:06:04,776
You know, after you died, Chase left her.

69
00:06:04,858 --> 00:06:08,055
She hit bottom. Did you know that?

70
00:06:08,139 --> 00:06:11,815
It's only right now
she's putting her life back together.

71
00:06:11,899 --> 00:06:14,698
Maybe you did know
but couldn't do anything about it.

72
00:06:14,779 --> 00:06:17,658
- This doesn't concern you.
- I think it concerns me.

73
00:06:17,741 --> 00:06:21,336
Miriam and I were there for Kim
when you weren't.

74
00:06:21,421 --> 00:06:26,098
Whatever you may think of me,
Miriam and I love that girl.

75
00:06:33,824 --> 00:06:36,258
Are you OK?

76
00:06:36,344 --> 00:06:38,700
Both my parents died here.

77
00:06:40,265 --> 00:06:46,501
- I swore I'd never come back to this place.
We can leave right now if you want.

78
00:06:46,586 --> 00:06:48,578
Here, she's coming.

79
00:06:49,906 --> 00:06:51,181
Kim.

80
00:06:51,266 --> 00:06:52,825
- Hi.
- Hi.

81
00:06:52,908 --> 00:06:54,943
This is Barry Landes.
- Hi.

82
00:06:55,027 --> 00:06:56,780
Audrey Raines.

83
00:06:56,868 --> 00:07:00,656
So, what it is? What did you have to tell me
that was so important?

84
00:07:00,748 --> 00:07:05,220
- It would be better if we talked in private.
- You can say it in front of Barry.

85
00:07:05,309 --> 00:07:08,586
- Kim, I really think...
- No, no. It's OK.

86
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:17,070
It's about your father.

87
00:07:17,152 --> 00:07:19,382
What about my father?

88
00:07:20,912 --> 00:07:23,108
He's alive.

89
00:07:26,634 --> 00:07:30,149
Kim, he wanted to tell you
but he couldn't, in order to protect you.

90
00:07:30,234 --> 00:07:33,112
Someone in the government
wanted your father dead,

91
00:07:33,195 --> 00:07:35,948
so he staged his own death
and went underground.

92
00:07:36,035 --> 00:07:41,316
He knew that you wouldn't be safe
if he told you that he was alive.

93
00:07:43,556 --> 00:07:46,947
I didn't know either until this morning.

94
00:07:50,478 --> 00:07:56,156
I thought maybe if I told you now before
you saw him it might be a little bit easier.

95
00:07:56,239 --> 00:07:58,628
He's on his way in now to CTU.

96
00:08:10,601 --> 00:08:12,274
Hello, Mike.

97
00:08:12,362 --> 00:08:16,072
Mr. Vice President.
I thought you were at Salt Lake City today.

98
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:20,715
Hal cancelled his engagements
to be here, Mike.

99
00:08:20,804 --> 00:08:23,876
We need all hands on deck
to deal with this situation.

100
00:08:23,964 --> 00:08:29,119
- Of course, Mr. President.
- OK. So, what's on your mind, Hal?

101
00:08:29,206 --> 00:08:34,155
Mr. President, when these terrorists attack
you're gonna need to maintain order.

102
00:08:34,246 --> 00:08:38,877
And I submit to you the plan
you're implementing with CTU is inadequate.

103
00:08:38,967 --> 00:08:44,679
Sir, it was drawn up after careful study
for an attack of just this magnitude.

104
00:08:44,768 --> 00:08:48,728
CTU is already coordinating
with first responders.

105
00:08:48,809 --> 00:08:51,960
Fine, and they should still do so.

106
00:08:52,049 --> 00:08:55,520
But what I'm proposing
is something far more sweeping.

107
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:59,445
I believe it's warranted by the facts. Andrew.

108
00:09:01,452 --> 00:09:05,889
To begin with,
I'm revising all of CTU's casualty estimates.

109
00:09:05,972 --> 00:09:10,842
Based on the assumptions the terrorists
will hit all of these targets - hospitals, malls,

110
00:09:10,933 --> 00:09:13,128
sporting arenas, transit hubs -

111
00:09:13,214 --> 00:09:16,365
my low estimate is 400,000 casualties.

112
00:09:16,814 --> 00:09:20,967
That's a considerable upward revision.
I'd like to know how you reached it.

113
00:09:21,055 --> 00:09:23,523
You're free to talk to my working group.

114
00:09:23,615 --> 00:09:27,370
There are a lot of people
who don't take this threat seriously enough.

115
00:09:27,456 --> 00:09:32,008
I assure you we're taking it very seriously.
We have no agenda but to do so.

116
00:09:32,097 --> 00:09:34,896
What's your recommendation?

117
00:09:34,977 --> 00:09:40,177
We should think of a pre-emptive declaration
of martial law in the greater Los Angeles area.

118
00:09:40,259 --> 00:09:45,777
Mr. President, martial law is appropriate
only as a last-ditch measure.

119
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:49,455
- Not as a pre-emptive one.
- Go on.

120
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:54,137
Every study we've done has shown
it would incite more unrest, not less.

121
00:09:54,221 --> 00:09:59,660
- And you'd need approval from Congress.
- Which is why we won't call it martial law.

122
00:09:59,742 --> 00:10:04,771
We're putting troops on the street
to try to keep people from killing each other.

123
00:10:04,863 --> 00:10:09,096
The panic hasn't happened. Right now
the public isn't even aware of a threat.

124
00:10:09,184 --> 00:10:13,098
You declare martial law,
you'll have to tell them.

125
00:10:14,425 --> 00:10:18,543
- How long will it take to deploy the troops?
- I'm in touch with the Pentagon.

126
00:10:18,626 --> 00:10:21,664
The National Guard is on stand-by
pending your decision.

127
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:27,185
I agree there's a case to be made,
but for God's sake, let's make it to Congress.

128
00:10:27,267 --> 00:10:30,065
- We can declare an emergency...
- We don't have time.

129
00:10:30,148 --> 00:10:32,788
Hal is right.
This attack could take place any minute.

130
00:10:32,868 --> 00:10:36,987
If CTU can't find this man Bierko,
we're gonna get hit.

131
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:41,503
It would be smart
to have control of the streets.

132
00:11:01,913 --> 00:11:05,624
- This is a mistake. You don't wanna do this.
- Get out.

133
00:11:05,715 --> 00:11:10,664
I'll get immediate immunity if I talk. You
know it and I know it. I'm not gonna ask for it.

134
00:11:10,755 --> 00:11:14,750
I'm not trying to protect myself.
I'm trying to protect this country.

135
00:11:14,836 --> 00:11:17,305
- What?
- You don't wanna know what I know.

136
00:11:17,397 --> 00:11:21,073
You get me to talk, I promise you
you'll just be opening Pandora's box.

137
00:11:21,157 --> 00:11:24,673
Tell me. Let me judge that for myself.

138
00:11:25,678 --> 00:11:27,988
That's what I thought.

139
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:34,991
- I'll set him up in Holding.
- Let me know when he's ready.

140
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,115
Jack.

141
00:11:50,403 --> 00:11:52,394
Key card, please.

142
00:12:09,367 --> 00:12:11,322
Well, all clear, sir.

143
00:12:11,407 --> 00:12:13,398
Go ahead.

144
00:12:35,844 --> 00:12:38,039
Yeah. OK, I will.

145
00:12:38,964 --> 00:12:41,354
Curtis is on his way back from the hospital.

146
00:12:41,445 --> 00:12:43,436
OK, good.

147
00:12:49,406 --> 00:12:51,398
Audrey.

148
00:12:57,167 --> 00:12:59,683
Did you speak to Kim?
What was her reaction?

149
00:12:59,768 --> 00:13:04,365
She's a little confused. She's here with
someone. I think it might be her boyfriend.

150
00:13:04,449 --> 00:13:06,883
His name is Barry Landes.

151
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:10,280
- Where is she?
- She's in the field ops office.

152
00:13:14,731 --> 00:13:16,722
- OK, thanks.
- Yeah.

153
00:13:45,097 --> 00:13:46,086
Hey.

154
00:13:48,857 --> 00:13:53,488
I don't know what to say.
I don't know what you expect me to say.

155
00:13:53,578 --> 00:13:56,218
You don't have to say anything.

156
00:13:56,299 --> 00:13:59,497
Why didn't you just tell me you were alive?

157
00:13:59,579 --> 00:14:03,858
I couldn't. If you knew I was alive
you would have been at risk.

158
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:08,332
- I had no choice.
- You could have chosen to trust her.

159
00:14:11,582 --> 00:14:14,620
- I'll speak with my daughter alone.
- That's not a good idea.

160
00:14:14,702 --> 00:14:17,660
- I don't care what you think.
- I'm sure you don't.

161
00:14:17,743 --> 00:14:21,292
All that matters is you,
even if it affects those that love you.

162
00:14:21,383 --> 00:14:22,737
Kim.

163
00:14:24,024 --> 00:14:27,017
Barry, please let me speak to my dad.

164
00:14:31,025 --> 00:14:34,177
- I'll be right outside.
- Yeah.

165
00:14:39,467 --> 00:14:41,503
Don’t judge him.

166
00:14:41,587 --> 00:14:44,261
He was there when no one else was.

167
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:57,340
The most painful thing
that I've ever been through

168
00:14:57,431 --> 00:15:00,104
was having to walk away from you.

169
00:15:01,711 --> 00:15:04,909
Even more painful than losing your mother.

170
00:15:04,991 --> 00:15:10,305
But it was the only way to make sure
that you would be safe.

171
00:15:10,393 --> 00:15:12,862
I buried you.

172
00:15:14,434 --> 00:15:17,027
I know.

173
00:15:19,394 --> 00:15:23,024
You know, there's something wrong
with people like you.

174
00:15:23,115 --> 00:15:25,391
You can't hold on to anything.

175
00:15:25,475 --> 00:15:30,072
Chase couldn't either. He tried for a while,
then he was gone, just like you.

176
00:15:30,156 --> 00:15:32,670
And now you're back,

177
00:15:32,757 --> 00:15:35,146
and I'm just supposed to...

178
00:15:39,798 --> 00:15:42,596
I'm happy that you're alive. I am.

179
00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:48,435
But I can't give you what you want right now.

180
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,031
OK. OK.

181
00:15:54,441 --> 00:15:56,716
I understand that.

182
00:16:04,643 --> 00:16:09,513
- I need you to know that I'm sorry and I...
- Please, just go.

183
00:16:12,444 --> 00:16:15,562
Excuse me. Burke needs you in Holding.

184
00:16:15,644 --> 00:16:17,954
I'll be there in a minute.

185
00:16:18,805 --> 00:16:22,685
I've gotta go. Barry's got a conference.
We have a plane to catch.

186
00:16:22,767 --> 00:16:24,758
Please, Kim.

187
00:16:25,727 --> 00:16:28,116
I want you to stay just a little longer.

188
00:16:28,207 --> 00:16:31,803
There's some things
that I still need to tell you.

189
00:16:31,888 --> 00:16:33,606
Please.

190
00:16:35,449 --> 00:16:37,644
I'll talk to Barry.

191
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:41,124
Fine.

192
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:45,285
I'll be right back.

193
00:17:49,502 --> 00:17:53,052
- You called for me, Tony?
- Yeah.

194
00:17:53,143 --> 00:17:56,580
- What's going on?
- That's what I wanted to ask you.

195
00:17:56,664 --> 00:17:59,053
What do you mean?

196
00:17:59,144 --> 00:18:01,534
What do you think I mean, Bill?

197
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:04,902
My wife was killed this morning
right in front of my eyes.

198
00:18:04,985 --> 00:18:09,059
- Nobody here's told me who did it or why.
- The investigation's ongoing.

199
00:18:09,146 --> 00:18:11,786
Come on, Bill.

200
00:18:11,866 --> 00:18:14,062
I used to work here.

201
00:18:14,147 --> 00:18:18,107
I know that's what you say to people
when you don't wanna tell them the truth.

202
00:18:18,188 --> 00:18:24,458
The truth is you're not an agent any more.
What you're asking me is classified.

203
00:18:24,549 --> 00:18:26,858
Tony, there's nothing you can do.

204
00:18:26,949 --> 00:18:31,580
I know there's nothing I can do!
Look at me, for God's sake.

205
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:34,704
I just wanna know who did it.

206
00:18:35,151 --> 00:18:41,149
For the sake of all the years I've given this
place, I think I deserve to know, don't you?

207
00:18:45,913 --> 00:18:48,109
All I can tell you is...

208
00:18:49,274 --> 00:18:52,710
Michelle's murder was part of a bigger plan

209
00:18:52,794 --> 00:18:56,470
to supply terrorists with Sentox nerve gas.

210
00:18:57,796 --> 00:18:59,990
Who was behind it?

211
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:03,306
Who's responsible, Bill?

212
00:19:04,717 --> 00:19:09,838
The highest we've got is someone
you might know from when he worked here.

213
00:19:09,917 --> 00:19:11,988
Christopher Henderson.

214
00:19:13,198 --> 00:19:14,518
W- what?

215
00:19:16,119 --> 00:19:17,393
Why?

216
00:19:17,479 --> 00:19:19,868
We're working on it, Tony.

217
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:23,115
Don't let him get away with this, Bill.

218
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,398
- Don't you let him cut a deal.
- I won't.

219
00:20:00,967 --> 00:20:03,481
What do we know
about the man who's with Kim?

220
00:20:03,568 --> 00:20:08,802
He's registered with the state
as a clinical psychologist.

221
00:20:08,888 --> 00:20:12,404
- She was his patient.
- I think so, yes.

222
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:19,042
<i>He's ready.</i>

223
00:20:21,651 --> 00:20:24,212
Whatever he's not telling us is important.

224
00:20:24,292 --> 00:20:26,487
He knows what's coming...

225
00:20:29,773 --> 00:20:34,483
and he's willing to tolerate an inhuman
amount of pain. Open the door.

226
00:20:58,018 --> 00:20:59,895
Dammit, Christopher.

227
00:21:01,099 --> 00:21:04,535
I don't think you became a part of this
because of self-interest.

228
00:21:04,619 --> 00:21:08,579
I believe you think what you're doing now
is the best thing for this country,

229
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:11,095
but it is not your choice to make.

230
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:16,494
That's good. Disarm your subject's resolve by
showing empathy and respect for his agenda.

231
00:21:16,581 --> 00:21:18,537
This is not a joke.

232
00:21:18,622 --> 00:21:20,817
Thousands of lives are at stake.

233
00:21:20,902 --> 00:21:24,976
People that we promised to protect,
to make feel safe.

234
00:21:25,063 --> 00:21:30,263
There is enough time for you to tell me what
I need to know to stop this insanity. Please.

235
00:21:30,344 --> 00:21:32,460
I'm sorry, Jack.

236
00:21:32,545 --> 00:21:36,458
I really am,
but I can't tell you what you wanna know.

237
00:21:45,306 --> 00:21:47,377
Start it.

238
00:22:48,759 --> 00:22:50,750
Mrs. Logan.

239
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:57,677
- Mrs. Logan, if I could have a minute?
- If this is about Aaron it doesn't concern you.

240
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,877
No, Mrs. Logan, it doesn't,
and I'm not here to discuss it.

241
00:23:00,961 --> 00:23:04,398
- Then what is it?
- The country's facing a crisis.

242
00:23:05,322 --> 00:23:08,041
The president needs you.

243
00:23:08,522 --> 00:23:11,162
He... he needs me?

244
00:23:11,243 --> 00:23:15,999
If you think the decision to let the attack
on the motorcade proceed was easy for him,

245
00:23:16,084 --> 00:23:17,676
you're wrong.

246
00:23:17,765 --> 00:23:22,156
I was with him
when he got down on his knees and prayed.

247
00:23:23,205 --> 00:23:25,481
- He did?
- He loves you.

248
00:23:25,566 --> 00:23:28,160
He didn't wanna lose you.

249
00:23:29,086 --> 00:23:35,083
But with the... the lives of so many people
in jeopardy, he felt he had no choice.

250
00:23:40,688 --> 00:23:46,242
We've known each other a long time. Stop
talking about what a positive influence I am

251
00:23:46,329 --> 00:23:51,325
and tell me precisely what it is
you're trying to get me to do.

252
00:23:55,571 --> 00:24:00,930
Vice President Gardner is advising your
husband declare martial law in Los Angeles

253
00:24:01,012 --> 00:24:05,131
in preparation for the release of the nerve gas.

254
00:24:05,213 --> 00:24:09,924
He wants to do it without Congressional
sanction or a timetable to lift it.

255
00:24:10,014 --> 00:24:13,371
- He can’t just rewrite the law.
- Hal's got an agenda.

256
00:24:13,455 --> 00:24:16,288
Well, he's wrong.
This'll make things far worse.

257
00:24:16,375 --> 00:24:21,245
Mrs. Logan, all I know
is the president is listening to Hal Gardner,

258
00:24:21,336 --> 00:24:27,014
and it will only help the country
to have him listening to you as well.

259
00:25:13,866 --> 00:25:19,146
Hold off on deploying units seven to twelve
until we finalise our scenarios. What is it?

260
00:25:19,227 --> 00:25:23,425
I noticed that one of the environmental
systems put out a trouble flag.

261
00:25:23,508 --> 00:25:25,578
It's probably a circuit board change.

262
00:25:25,668 --> 00:25:28,866
I logged on to the manifest
and there's nothing scheduled.

263
00:25:28,948 --> 00:25:34,070
Carrie, I'm in the middle of coordinating
the first responders. I don't have time for this.

264
00:25:34,149 --> 00:25:37,666
You don't have to snap at me.
I thought someone should check it out.

265
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:40,185
Then check it out.

266
00:25:45,111 --> 00:25:46,909
Carrie!

267
00:26:56,965 --> 00:26:59,160
Can you forgive me?

268
00:27:00,006 --> 00:27:03,238
You acted like
the President of the United States.

269
00:27:03,326 --> 00:27:05,317
Yes, I did.

270
00:27:06,527 --> 00:27:09,997
But you wanted me to be your husband first.

271
00:27:12,288 --> 00:27:15,281
I can't pretend that I didn't.

272
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:23,529
I still love you as much as I always did.

273
00:27:27,411 --> 00:27:30,643
- Marty...
- Shh. Shh.

274
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:33,611
There'll be plenty of time for us later.

275
00:27:33,692 --> 00:27:35,922
You have to get back to work.

276
00:27:36,012 --> 00:27:39,767
The country needs you more than I do.

277
00:27:45,774 --> 00:27:47,925
Hello?

278
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:50,970
Anybody working on the system?

279
00:28:58,525 --> 00:29:00,435
Chloe.

280
00:29:00,525 --> 00:29:01,674
Hi, Kim.

281
00:29:01,765 --> 00:29:04,564
- You're still here.
- Yeah.

282
00:29:04,645 --> 00:29:07,957
My father had to do something.
Do you know how long he'll be?

283
00:29:08,046 --> 00:29:11,039
- No. Sorry.
- Chloe...

284
00:29:11,127 --> 00:29:13,960
I'm kinda busy right now.

285
00:29:14,048 --> 00:29:17,677
You knew my father was alive, didn't you?

286
00:29:18,528 --> 00:29:21,726
For a year-and-a-half you've known.

287
00:29:22,769 --> 00:29:24,044
Yeah.

288
00:29:24,129 --> 00:29:28,282
- He trusted you.
- Because he had to. I helped stage his death.

289
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:32,410
- You don't have to make excuses.
- I'm not. Four people knew he was alive.

290
00:29:32,491 --> 00:29:37,850
Two are dead, President Palmer and Michelle
Dessler. Tony Almeida's in serious condition.

291
00:29:37,932 --> 00:29:40,652
Michelle's dead?

292
00:29:42,293 --> 00:29:45,444
I'm only alive
because your dad found me in time.

293
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:51,882
I know this is hard for you and it's none of my
business, but you should cut him some slack.

294
00:30:01,056 --> 00:30:03,252
What's going on, Bill?

295
00:30:05,177 --> 00:30:07,168
Lynn...

296
00:30:11,378 --> 00:30:13,370
What is it?

297
00:30:14,738 --> 00:30:17,128
We just got a call from LAPD.

298
00:30:18,219 --> 00:30:20,973
They found your sister's body
in her apartment.

299
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:23,529
She'd been shot.

300
00:30:23,621 --> 00:30:26,181
What? I-I just talked to her.

301
00:30:26,261 --> 00:30:29,732
I saw her today. That's impossible. She can't...

302
00:30:30,381 --> 00:30:32,691
I'm sorry, Lynn.

303
00:30:32,782 --> 00:30:34,978
The police ID'd her body.

304
00:30:38,023 --> 00:30:40,015
My God.

305
00:30:48,705 --> 00:30:55,054
If you need a phone to make
some personal calls or talk to the police...

306
00:30:55,147 --> 00:30:57,377
Her boyfriend did this to her.

307
00:30:57,467 --> 00:30:59,742
Tell me he's in custody.

308
00:30:59,828 --> 00:31:02,945
- Is his name Dwayne Thompkins?
- Yeah.

309
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:06,304
He didn't do it. They found his body too.

310
00:31:12,509 --> 00:31:16,708
Lynn, the police are trying
to make sense of something.

311
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:22,104
Do you know if either your sister or
her boyfriend were involved in dealing drugs

312
00:31:22,192 --> 00:31:25,741
or had ties to organised crime?

313
00:31:29,833 --> 00:31:32,826
She was a pretty serious user.

314
00:31:35,034 --> 00:31:37,992
But organised crime? No way.

315
00:31:38,074 --> 00:31:40,066
Why?

316
00:31:40,995 --> 00:31:45,467
The killings were clearly
the work of a professional.

317
00:31:46,836 --> 00:31:48,827
My God.

318
00:31:50,636 --> 00:31:55,666
- Who's investigating? I have to talk to 'em.
- I can arrange a meeting.

319
00:31:55,758 --> 00:31:59,387
No. They have to search the apartment,
see if my key card was there.

320
00:31:59,479 --> 00:32:02,596
- What are you talking about?
- My CTU key card. She has it.

321
00:32:02,678 --> 00:32:07,594
- What was she doing with your key card?
- It was stolen from me. Her boyfriend took it.

322
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:11,150
- Why didn't you report this?
- I am now. We don't have time to argue.

323
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:16,475
Call and see if anyone used it to breach
Security. It was taken about four hours ago.

324
00:32:21,002 --> 00:32:25,282
Chloe, I'm in Holding with Lynn.
I need you to check the gate logs now.

325
00:32:25,363 --> 00:32:30,074
- What am I looking for?
- If anyone used Lynn's key card to enter CTU.

326
00:32:30,164 --> 00:32:34,283
- Isn't Lynn standing right next to you?
- Chloe, do it!

327
00:32:34,365 --> 00:32:38,723
It's showing that his card was used less
than an hour ago at the executive entrance.

328
00:32:38,806 --> 00:32:41,958
<i>- He was already here.
- Lock down CTU now.</i>

329
00:32:42,047 --> 00:32:44,686
This is Chloe O'Brian.
Initiate a lockdown now.

330
00:32:48,287 --> 00:32:53,885
Mr. Bauer, I'm sorry. I don't know what's
going on. He should be talking by now.

331
00:32:55,769 --> 00:32:58,363
Dammit, Christopher. I don't wanna do this.

332
00:32:58,449 --> 00:33:00,964
- Just talk to me.
- Can't.

333
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:05,283
I need to stabilise him in the clinic
before administering another dose.

334
00:33:05,371 --> 00:33:08,568
This is Bauer.

335
00:33:08,652 --> 00:33:12,884
We've been compromised. Someone used
a stolen key card to access CTU.

336
00:33:12,972 --> 00:33:15,532
- Did you get an ID?
- Not yet.

337
00:33:15,613 --> 00:33:17,968
They're still here. We're in lockdown.

338
00:33:18,053 --> 00:33:24,050
I'm on my way. Get him to Medical.
Stabilise him. Don't let anyone near him.

339
00:33:41,578 --> 00:33:44,809
- Did you get him?
- Still working on it. Exits are sealed.

340
00:33:44,898 --> 00:33:46,809
Security are going room to room.

341
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:49,413
Give me a comm unit.
Is Kim still up in field ops?

342
00:33:49,499 --> 00:33:52,492
- With Landes, yes.
- Get her here. I want a guard on her.

343
00:33:52,579 --> 00:33:56,619
- I found the hostile. He's in third west.
- Could exit south or north.

344
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:59,419
Jack, take north. Mack's team will head south.

345
00:33:59,501 --> 00:34:01,457
Copy that.

346
00:34:01,541 --> 00:34:04,375
Pull up north and south angles.

347
00:34:06,222 --> 00:34:09,772
There he is.
- Run his face through recognition software.

348
00:34:09,862 --> 00:34:12,696
Where's Carrie?
I need her to check for intrusions.

349
00:34:12,783 --> 00:34:15,457
She's checking on a warning signal
on a B socket.

350
00:34:15,544 --> 00:34:17,740
Got it. Checking the grid.

351
00:34:30,787 --> 00:34:33,780
You're gonna help me get outta here.

352
00:34:36,628 --> 00:34:40,064
- He's in the north corridor.
- I wanna see what's keeping Carrie.

353
00:34:40,149 --> 00:34:44,540
All units, the hostile's in the north corridor.
He's got one of our men.

354
00:35:00,032 --> 00:35:03,708
- Enter your pass code.
- But it's a lockdown.

355
00:35:04,633 --> 00:35:06,624
Just do it.

356
00:35:22,557 --> 00:35:25,469
He's in the north hallway, sublevel B.

357
00:35:25,557 --> 00:35:28,151
- Jack, do you read?
- On my way.

358
00:35:53,482 --> 00:35:57,362
- Bill, he's in the stairwell.
- I don't think so, Jack.

359
00:35:57,443 --> 00:36:00,800
- Davis said he checked sublevel B.
- Bill.

360
00:36:00,883 --> 00:36:02,875
It's all clear.

361
00:36:05,684 --> 00:36:08,961
<i>No, he's doubled back.
He's using the stairs to get to the roof.</i>

362
00:36:09,045 --> 00:36:12,163
All right, Jack.
I'm sending units to the landings.

363
00:36:12,245 --> 00:36:15,238
<i>Let me know when you're ready to move.</i>

364
00:36:15,326 --> 00:36:17,318
Copy that.

365
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:34,448
Freeze!

366
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:36,566
Let me see your hands.

367
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:38,164
Slowly.

368
00:36:38,611 --> 00:36:41,126
Drop the gun.

369
00:36:43,052 --> 00:36:44,610
Now!

370
00:36:55,454 --> 00:36:58,491
Hostile's down. He's dead.
It was the only shot I had.

371
00:36:58,575 --> 00:37:00,486
Do you have an ID, Jack?

372
00:37:00,575 --> 00:37:06,048
We got a bigger problem than that. He's got
a device on him. Looks like a relay switch.

373
00:37:06,136 --> 00:37:10,494
<i>- He's got a PDA. Oh, my God.
- What is it, Jack?</i>

374
00:37:10,577 --> 00:37:14,889
A schematic of CTU's ventilation system.
I think he tried to deploy nerve gas.

375
00:37:14,977 --> 00:37:20,177
Order an evacuation.
Code six! Everybody out! Go! Go!

376
00:37:20,259 --> 00:37:22,329
- I have Kim with me.
- Stay with her.

377
00:37:22,419 --> 00:37:25,729
Make sure Burke gets Henderson outta here
as fast as he can.

378
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:28,937
- I'm on it. Don't move. I'll be right back.
- O'Brian.

379
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:33,811
- Chloe, what's going on?
- Edgar, get out of the building now.

380
00:37:33,901 --> 00:37:35,574
Carrie.

381
00:38:04,586 --> 00:38:08,819
We have to get out of the building now.
Just hurry.

382
00:38:08,908 --> 00:38:12,458
What's wrong with those people?
Oh, my God.

383
00:38:12,548 --> 00:38:15,780
- The gas is coming in.
- The ducts run from the outside in.

384
00:38:15,869 --> 00:38:19,544
- Outside in? What does that mean?
- They reach the building core last.

385
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:22,190
Lock the outer doors.
Which rooms can we seal?

386
00:38:22,271 --> 00:38:25,229
- I'm working on it!
- Burke, I need you to stand by.

387
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:28,384
I'll let you know
where you can move Henderson.

388
00:38:28,471 --> 00:38:32,545
- Chloe, what rooms can you lock down?
- Hold on!

389
00:38:32,632 --> 00:38:36,023
The situation room,
the upper offices and clinic isolation.

390
00:38:36,113 --> 00:38:39,822
- Go, people!
- Kim, everybody, in the situation room. Now.

391
00:38:39,914 --> 00:38:45,228
Burke, you can move Henderson
to the clinic isolation. Seal it off for bio-air.

392
00:38:45,315 --> 00:38:48,945
Get into the situation room now. Move!

393
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:52,233
Chloe, seal it. Seal all the rooms.

394
00:39:02,958 --> 00:39:05,598
Open the door!
You have to let me in! Open the door.

395
00:39:05,678 --> 00:39:09,388
- Let her in.
- We can't break the seal. Find another exit.

396
00:39:09,479 --> 00:39:11,788
Hurry! Go!

397
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:16,237
- Chloe, are the rest of the rooms sealed?
- Yes, it's done.

398
00:39:44,806 --> 00:39:49,800
Everybody, stay calm.
There's nothing we can do for her now.

399
00:39:52,927 --> 00:39:54,919
Oh, no.

400
00:39:59,888 --> 00:40:02,357
Oh, my God.

401
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:10,207
Chloe.
