1
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,794
- We have a successful launch.
- Good.

2
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:22,159
My government has alerted me of the nuclear
weapon heading toward my country.

3
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,835
That's correct, Mr Ambassador.
We've made good on our threat.

4
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,754
We have identified a general
in central command, Mohmar Habib,

5
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,751
who has been in contact with Fayed.

6
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,990
He's been helping orchestrate attacks.

7
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:38,835
I really hope protecting this man was worth
pushing us to the brink of World War III.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,037
I've never found
pharmaceutical torture that effective.

9
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:44,996
I have.

10
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:48,117
If this is supposed to frighten me,
you're wasting your time.

11
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,792
I won't tell you a thing.

12
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,598
<i>(honks horn) Watch out!</i>

13
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,392
<i>(Buchanan) We staged a fake rescue</i>

14
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,393
<i>by CTU agents posing as members
of a terrorist cell with loyalties to Habib.</i>

15
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,268
He wants us to help you rendezvous.
Where do you want us to take you?

16
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:08,672
If you take your orders from Habib, as I do,
how is it I've never heard of you?

17
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,276
- Fayed's gone.
- Jamal's alive. Stay with him. Call a medic.

18
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,590
On it.

19
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,600
CTU, the bombs are secure.

20
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,992
<i>- Hello?
- (Audrey) Jack... Are you there?</i>

21
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,469
- Can you hear me?
- Audrey.

22
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,235
Help me, Jack.

23
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,551
Hello, Mr Bauer. Yes, Miss Raines is alive.

24
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,916
If you wish her to remain that way,
call me back in ten minutes.

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,549
If you make any attempt
to find our location, she dies.

26
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,198
Cheng?

27
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,079
Agent Bauer,
you really do need to get to a hospital,

28
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:17,233
but I understand the circumstances.
At least this will help you with the pain.

29
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,231
Thank you.

30
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,630
Hey, Jack. The marines will secure the nukes
for transport. They're calling the shots.

31
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,835
Military's taking over?

32
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,993
Yeah, according to a presidential order.
I guess DOD doesn't want CTU in charge.

33
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,311
Buchanan wants you to call
as soon as the nukes are ready.

34
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,278
- Can you handle that for me?
- Sure.

35
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,679
Jack?

36
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,751
What?

37
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,071
I know you've been through hell
the last couple of years,

38
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,594
and I wanted
to thank you for what you did today,

39
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:01,515
cos it could've ended a hell of a lot worse,
and it would have if you weren't here.

40
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,828
I appreciate that. Excuse me.

41
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,591
<i>(phone rings)</i>

42
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,911
<i>- Yes?
- This is Bauer. Let me speak to Audrey.</i>

43
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,276
- You've already spoken to her.
- I wanna make sure she's all right.

44
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,750
Her wellbeing is entirely up to you,
Mr Bauer.

45
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:44,753
Everyone has given up on you,
everyone - except for Miss Raines.

46
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,549
Over the objections of your government,
her family, her friends,

47
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,996
she came to Beijing just to find you.

48
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,719
Since you proved to be
an uncooperative prisoner,

49
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:59,510
we felt she would be an asset
we might be able to exploit one day,

50
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,670
and that day is here.

51
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,434
I'll hand myself over to you. Tell me where.

52
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,397
A man who won't break is of no use to us.

53
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,836
But the Russian suitcase nukes
you captured...

54
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,992
Why? Your country has the technology
to build those weapons.

55
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,435
It's not the weapons we're interested in.

56
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:23,479
What we want is the component
from the triggering mechanism.

57
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,313
It contains prototype algorithm

58
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,598
old enough to be free
of any modern decryption safeguards.

59
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:36,471
With it, we'll have access to
virtually all Russian defence technology.

60
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,390
It's a simple exchange.

61
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,517
You give me the component,
I give you Audrey.

62
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,395
<i>If you refuse, I'll kill her.</i>

63
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,869
The Russians will know
that we supplied you.

64
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:53,239
- You would be starting World War III.
- I suggest we leave that to the diplomats.

65
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:56,392
Even if I wanted to,
the bombs are under military control.

66
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:01,076
- I couldn't get anywhere near them.
- You'll find a way.

67
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,275
If I'm gonna agree to this,
I wanna speak to Audrey now.

68
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,430
Very well.

69
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,913
Speak to him.

70
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:25,038
- Jack.
- Audrey, are you all right? Did they hurt you?

71
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,873
No. Jack, I... I'm sorry.

72
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:33,034
You have nothing to be sorry for. The only
thing that's important is that you're alive.

73
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,118
I know what they're asking for. I can handle it.

74
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,875
I promise you I'm gonna get you outta there.
Just don't be frightened.

75
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,758
You have an hour to call this number
to make the exchange.

76
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,956
An hour's not gonna give me enough time.

77
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,395
Cheng? Cheng?

78
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,713
<i>(man) Go ahead and move it all the way back.</i>

79
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,236
You know,
you really should work from Medical, sir.

80
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,356
Come on. At least they can monitor you.

81
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,113
I'm fine, Tom.

82
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:31,239
I... I don't think that you are, sir.
And neither does Doctor Weldon.

83
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:35,233
Putting myself under supervision
might give the vice president a pretext

84
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:38,312
to try and take a run at my job.

85
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,517
You don't need to worry about that, sir.

86
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,878
What exactly do you have
on Vice President Daniels?

87
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,470
I have the truth, sir.

88
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,357
Now is the time
that I need to know what that is.

89
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:02,355
It is a tape recording of Vice President Daniels
conspiring with Lisa Miller

90
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:06,433
to commit perjury
at your competency hearing.

91
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,876
I'd love to hear that as soon as possible.

92
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:13,475
Mr President, Tom, I have good news.

93
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,711
CTU has recovered
the two remaining suitcase nukes.

94
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,870
- When?
- Just a few minutes ago.

95
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,430
I just got off the phone with Bill.
He'll brief you when you're ready.

96
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:26,559
- What about Fayed?
- He and his men were killed in the assault.

97
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,200
- Then it's over?
- Well, it certainly seems so, sir.

98
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,271
Congratulations.

99
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:37,392
The American people should know, and I
wanna tell them that we're no longer at risk.

100
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,152
I'll get the press corps down.

101
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:43,233
No, no, Karen. We're gonna do this
from upstairs. In the press room.

102
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,390
Shouldn't we wait for clearance?

103
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:49,996
No, Tom. There's no need for any of us to be
hiding underground for a minute longer.

104
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:55,871
Inform Secret Service that we'll be leaving
the bunker and returning to the Oval Office.

105
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,315
<i>(Karen) Yes, sir.</i>

106
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,791
Morris is coordinating with the
Marines Technical Escort Unit

107
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:05,270
to transfer the bombs to a NEST facility.

108
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,638
Now that they've taken custody,
I'd like you all to submit your briefings

109
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:13,030
<i>- to the respective department heads.
- (phone vibrates)</i>

110
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,430
I'd like to share my pride
in the work that you've all done.

111
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,114
We were hit hard...

112
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,919
but not one of you gave up.

113
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,309
You've done excellent work today.
Work that...

114
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,436
- O'Brian.
- Hey. It's me.

115
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:30,149
- Jack, you did it.
- Chloe, listen to me. I need your help.

116
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,073
Can it wait?
We're transferring bombs and doing cleanup.

117
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:36,311
- No, it can't.
- What is it?

118
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,868
- Chloe, Audrey's still alive.
- No, she's not.

119
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,952
She is. I talked to her.
The Chinese faked her car accident.

120
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:49,511
They've been holding her a prisoner
since she was in Beijing trying to find me.

121
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,398
Oh, my God. We have to tell Mr Buchanan.

122
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,471
<i>He'll never go along with it.</i>

123
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,199
"Go along" with what?

124
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:00,511
The Chinese wanna exchange Audrey
for an FB-sub-circuit board.

125
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,195
It'll give them complete access
to Russian defence technology.

126
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:07,511
I want you to help me
retrieve one of those circuit boards.

127
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,037
Jack, we both know that if we do this, it will
create an international situation bigtime.

128
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,918
Chloe, I know.
I promise I will do whatever I have to

129
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,434
to stop the Chinese from getting that board,

130
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,909
but I need you
to get schematics for the bombs.

131
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,151
Those files aren't on my system.
They were reclassified

132
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,515
when DOD took possession of the nuke.

133
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,354
Figure it out. Without those schematics,
I won't know what I'm looking for.

134
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,829
I understand,
but I don't know how I can do this.

135
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,673
Chloe, Audrey's life is at stake. Think.

136
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,392
Wait.

137
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,232
Morris.

138
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,279
He had to file a report with DOD
about the work he did on the nukes.

139
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,909
It contained a revised schematic.
It might still be on his hard drive.

140
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,275
- Can you access it?
- Only from his terminal.

141
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,157
Chloe, please, do it.

142
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,393
- Where should I send it?
- The phone I'm calling you from.

143
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,198
Use a secure line. Alpha 539.

144
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,396
Hold on...

145
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,555
It's here. The file's coming up.

146
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:18,837
I'm sending it to your screen. Stand by.

147
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,797
Copy that.

148
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:30,557
- Chloe, I don't see anything.
- It needs to load before it sends.

149
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,875
There's still 30% to go. Dammit.

150
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,632
What?

151
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,756
- Morris is coming back.
- Hurry.

152
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,513
There's nothing I can do.
I need to log out. He's here.

153
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,830
No, Chloe, wait.

154
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,514
- Jack...
- Come on...

155
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,117
I got it.

156
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,353
<i>- (intercom beeps)
- Yes?</i>

157
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:18,036
<i>(woman) Mr President,
Vice President Daniels is here.</i>

158
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,550
<i>- Send him in.
- Yes, sir.</i>

159
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,511
Noah.

160
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,591
Please sit.

161
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,716
Listen, I, uh...

162
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,150
I wanna begin
by expressing my gratitude to you...

163
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,035
for a lesson well learned.

164
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,195
I'm not sure what you mean, Mr President.

165
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,397
I believe attacking Fayed's country
with a nuclear weapon

166
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:01,234
would have been a serious mistake.
I'm not going to lie to you about that.

167
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:05,359
But if you hadn't have put that option
on the table in the first place,

168
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,070
I never would have gone as far as I did,
and the bombs might still be out there.

169
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,072
That being said, I think we would both agree

170
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:16,948
that our relationship has
always been a marriage of convenience,

171
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,476
a way to strengthen the ticket
rather than a case of seeing eye to eye

172
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,994
on pretty much anything.

173
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,835
And now that it's over, this crisis,
it's become clear to me, Noah,

174
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:32,914
that I just don't think it's possible
for us to work together any more.

175
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,356
Excuse me?

176
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,716
I'm asking for your resignation.

177
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,754
How dare you?

178
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,479
You don't have the right
to ask for my resignation.

179
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:51,348
This isn't about
what the constitution says, Noah.

180
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,273
It's about what's best
for the country in crisis.

181
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,952
And how do you figure that?

182
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,474
I can't lead effectively
with you undermining me

183
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,438
at every single opportunity that you may get.

184
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,954
And let's be honest with each other,

185
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:07,715
that's exactly what you would do
if you stayed in place.

186
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,680
Mr President...

187
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,115
I refuse.

188
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,760
Good night.

189
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:22,719
You don't wanna walk out that door,
not like this.

190
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:28,157
Otherwise, I may have to make this
extremely unpleasant for you.

191
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,988
- What are you talking about?
- The recording

192
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:36,153
that Tom Lennox has in his possession,
that's what I'm talking about.

193
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,950
Conspiracy to commit perjury?
That's a serious offence.

194
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,792
I have to assume you'd rather resign

195
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:47,635
than spend the rest of your life
living with that kind of humiliation.

196
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:52,714
So is resorting to blackmail
your idea of effective leadership?

197
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,756
If I've learned anything from you,

198
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:59,436
it would be that sometimes
it's necessary to apply a little brute force.

199
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,235
I don't need your resignation immediately.

200
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:07,472
Let's give the country a chance
to take a breath after what happened today.

201
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:12,714
Sometime in the next week will be just fine,
Mr Vice President.

202
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,351
NEST wants a path cleared to Edwards,
20 miles in each direction.

203
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,637
Could you get back to me with confirmation?
Thank you.

204
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,280
ETA on the helicopter is 15 minutes.

205
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,749
Distribute protocols to the NEST team.

206
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:43,719
<i>- I'm on that.
- (computer beeps)</i>

207
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,553
- That's odd.
- What?

208
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:49,108
I think someone's hacked into my system.

209
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,918
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

210
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,437
I installed a logging program to track
any unauthorised access to my hard drive.

211
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,670
You did?

212
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:01,594
It's telling me that someone
accessed my files ten minutes ago

213
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:06,959
and downloaded the updated schematics
to those suitcase nukes.

214
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:11,795
- I'm calling security.
- Wait, don't call security.

215
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,992
I'm the one who hacked into your system.

216
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,996
Why would you do that?

217
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:24,356
I'll explain it to you in a little while.

218
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,429
Explain it to me now.

219
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:44,390
I did it for Jack.
Audrey Raines is still alive.

220
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,790
- The Chinese are holding her hostage.
- What?

221
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,838
They'll kill her unless
Jack delivers a sub-circuit board

222
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:53,593
from one of the bombs to them.

223
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,830
You've been to all the same briefings.

224
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,151
The Russians have kept that
out of Chinese hands for years.

225
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,150
I know.

226
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,550
What are the Russians gonna say
when they find out we gave it to them?

227
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,232
It's not gonna get that far.

228
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:12,437
How in the world do you know
it's not gonna get that far?!

229
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,511
Because Jack gave me his word.

230
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,758
I'm sorry, darling, but I can't leave it at that.

231
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,831
Yes, you can.

232
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:26,435
The bombs I reprogrammed
could have killed tens of thousands.

233
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:29,671
- But that didn't happen.
- I could have been responsible

234
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,513
for each and every one of their deaths.

235
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:36,957
I can't be involved with something
that could easily end up starting a war.

236
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,157
It's not gonna start a war,
because it's not gonna get that far.

237
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,356
This has nothing to do with you. I did it.

238
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:45,796
Yes, it does. Now that you've told me, it does.

239
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,030
- You have to tell Buchanan.
- I can't.

240
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,194
- Then you're forcing me to.
- No.

241
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:55,716
- I'm gonna do it. I'm doing it.
- No! Morris!

242
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,991
I'll tell him.

243
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,074
Reinforcements aren't necessary at this point.

244
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:27,711
The military is guarding the bombs
with a CTU SWAT team standing by.

245
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:32,351
<i>- They'll be en route soon.
- (man) Very good, sir. I'll notify everyone.</i>

246
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:35,477
All right, thank you. What is it, Chloe?

247
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:38,438
Mr Buchanan...

248
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:43,830
I'm sorry. There... there's
something that you need to know.

249
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,069
- You two come with me.
- This area is off limits.

250
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:22,436
I'm Agent Bauer.
I was responsible for securing these nukes.

251
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:25,796
I'm under a presidential order
to remove the FB circuit board

252
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,075
and transfer it back to CTU for analysis.

253
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,151
We don't have much time. Open the gate.

254
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,037
Sir, no one is allowed in here.

255
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:35,112
Are you countermanding
a presidential order? How dare you?

256
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,034
Now you're wasting my time.
What's your name? What's your name?!

257
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,838
I want your name too! Now!

258
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:45,152
That's not necessary.
O... open the gate. Open the gate!

259
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:54,748
I want both of you to stand guard
while I remove the circuit board. Come on.

260
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,710
- Stand down, Jack!
- I can't do that.

261
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:38,032
- I won't say it again. Drop it!
- Agent Doyle, I am following orders...

262
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:41,271
- Take him out! Take him out!
- Put your weapon down or I'll shoot!

263
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,270
Now!

264
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,474
Secure him. He's under arrest.

265
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:19,069
- Doyle, please, just listen to me.
- Bill, we got Jack.

266
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,515
- What'd he say?
- Not much. I had to subdue him.

267
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,433
- Let me talk to him.
- Hold on.

268
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,913
- Buchanan wants to talk to you.
- Bill.

269
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,275
Chloe told me about Audrey and the Chinese.

270
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,749
I can't let you give them the component.

271
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:36,879
I'm not going to. I only need to have it
long enough for them to let her go.

272
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,996
I was never gonna let the Chinese keep it.

273
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,799
Whatever you have planned,
I can't let you do it.

274
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:46,317
Bill, please.
Right now we're the only chance she's got.

275
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,356
I understand what Audrey means to you.

276
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,715
I promise I will do everything to get her back.

277
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,758
You didn't even know she was alive.

278
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:57,469
Cheng is gonna make it impossible
for us to ever find her again.

279
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,915
We are her only hope, and you know it.

280
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,438
I don't know what to tell you. Let Doyle bring
you back here and we'll work out a game plan.

281
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:09,238
Will you let me make one more call?

282
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:14,232
I'm asking you as a friend.

283
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,515
Who do you wanna talk to?

284
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,637
President Wayne Palmer.

285
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,233
<i>(sighs)</i>

286
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,198
I'll see if I can reach him. Let me talk to Doyle.

287
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,952
Yeah.

288
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,235
He wants to talk to you.

289
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,397
- Doyle.
- Keep Jack in custody. I'll call the president.

290
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,234
- I'll route the call through your cell.
- Yes, sir, I understand.

291
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,311
Get him up.

292
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:46,593
<i>(woman on TV) Sources confirm
that terrorist leader Abu Fayed is dead.</i>

293
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,911
<i>The president has recovered
from injuries sustained</i>

294
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,753
<i>from the attempt on his life,
and he is expected to...</i>

295
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,308
<i>- (intercom buzzes)
- Yes?</i>

296
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:59,313
<i>- (woman) Jack Bauer on the line.
- Put him through, please.</i>

297
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,277
<i>(phone rings)</i>

298
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,828
<i>- Go ahead.
- Please hold for the president.</i>

299
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,309
It's the president.

300
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,197
Excuse me.

301
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,918
- Mr President.
- Yes. Jack.

302
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,195
<i>Congratulations. Is everything all right?</i>

303
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,475
Yes, sir, the bombs are secure.

304
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:17,597
I'm calling because I want you
to authorise a field operation.

305
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,910
- For what purpose?
- To save Audrey Raines.

306
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,434
- What?
- Mr President, she's still alive.

307
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:26,593
The Chinese have been holding her,
and are using her as a bargaining chip.

308
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:30,434
- In exchange for what?
- For an FB-sub-circuit board from a nuke.

309
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:34,877
<i>They say they'll release Audrey unharmed
if I bring it to them.</i>

310
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,589
Jack, that component
holds the key to Russian defence codes.

311
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:41,638
- Yes, sir, I'm aware of that.
- I'm sympathetic, I am.

312
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:44,951
I will make available to you
the full resources of this country

313
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:49,079
to get Audrey back, but I hope you don't
expect me to authorise this exchange.

314
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,071
- Not exactly.
- Then what exactly?

315
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:55,631
I need the Chinese to believe that I am
willing to go through with this exchange.

316
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,553
I need to have the component on me.
They'll need to see it.

317
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,108
As soon as I know Audrey is free,
I will destroy it.

318
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,078
And how can you guarantee that?

319
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:07,072
I'm asking you to trust me, Mr President.

320
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,354
I give you my word that that component
will not end up in Chinese hands.

321
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:16,309
But if it does, the Russians may take action
against us for allowing it to happen.

322
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,472
Under most circumstances,
your word would be sufficient.

323
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:22,870
But in this case, Jack, I need to know details.

324
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:28,396
If I have to, I will destroy that circuit board
with a concealed charge of C4.

325
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:33,918
An explosion of C4 would
take out anything within 30 feet of it...

326
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,232
- You're gonna sacrifice yourself?
- Yes, sir, if I have to.

327
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:44,835
- Jack.
- Mr President, please.

328
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:47,480
Please, I am begging you.

329
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:50,552
Audrey Raines was willing
to give up her life to save mine.

330
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,393
I cannot and will not do anything less for her.

331
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:56,278
You're asking me
to sign off on a suicide mission.

332
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,713
With all due respect,

333
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:02,954
16 hours ago your people were willing to
hand me over for dead, and I did not hesitate.

334
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,268
Mr President... you owe me.

335
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,153
And you're sure this is the only way?

336
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,231
Yes.

337
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,151
All right, then.

338
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,798
I will not fail you, Mr President.

339
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,669
I'll tell Bill to give you whatever you need.

340
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:34,514
Now, I'm gonna need confirmation
that circuit board's been destroyed.

341
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:39,071
I'll have CTU embed a tracking device
in the board. You'll have your confirmation.

342
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:42,835
<i>- Good luck, Jack.
- Thank you, Mr President.</i>

343
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,235
<i>- (woman) Yes, sir?
- Let me speak with Bill.</i>

344
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,709
<i>Right away.</i>

345
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,597
<i>(Buchanan) That's the way it is.
You've got your orders.</i>

346
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:02,069
<i>Let me know how Jack wants to proceed.</i>

347
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,674
Yes, sir. I understand.

348
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,516
Get over here.

349
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,277
What did he say?

350
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,396
He said the president signed off on this,

351
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:22,870
and to give you whatever help you needed.

352
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:27,151
I'm gonna need someone
to help me with Audrey's extraction.

353
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,356
I want that to be you.

354
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,317
Fine. Where are you gonna be?

355
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:37,599
The name of the Chinese agent
that's holding Audrey is Cheng Zhi.

356
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:41,753
He's responsible for my interrogation
and torture for two years in that prison.

357
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:45,515
As soon as I get the signal
that Audrey is safe, two things will happen.

358
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:50,720
I'll destroy that circuit board, and Cheng Zhi
isn't gonna make it outta here alive.

359
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,918
So in answer to your question,
where am I gonna be...

360
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,993
Wherever I have to. Let's go.

361
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:14,517
Are you gonna tell me what happened?

362
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,717
The president agreed to Jack's plan.

363
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:21,759
The president's gonna allow Jack
to hand a defence algorithm to the Chinese?

364
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:26,516
Of course not. Jack'll destroy the component
as soon as he knows Audrey's safe.

365
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,511
The Chinese will never get it.

366
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:31,160
And how is he gonna manage that?

367
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:35,631
I don't know.
I guess President Palmer trusts him.

368
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:38,917
Telling Buchanan was the right thing to do.
You know it was.

369
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,719
It doesn't matter. You should have trusted me.

370
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:45,076
Trusted you?
You're the one that broke into my system.

371
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:48,399
Because I didn't think you'd back me up.
I was right.

372
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,916
So you're gonna
hold this over my head now, are you?

373
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,911
Yeah, for a long time.

374
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:58,230
For how long?
Could you give me an estimate?

375
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,390
I'll get back to you.

376
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:09,356
Nadia, Doyle's on line three.

377
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,910
Ready to lock in on the tracking frequency.

378
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,639
- This is Nadia.
- It's me. The tracker's online.

379
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,359
The frequency mark is alpha-1793.

380
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:29,070
- The signal's good. You're on the grid.
- Copy. Jack and I are getting ready to move.

381
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,991
<i>- (phone rings)
- Yes?</i>

382
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,310
<i>(Jack) I have the board. Where am I going?</i>

383
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,550
Get on the 180 and head north.

384
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:41,192
Get off the first exit after mile-marker 49. I'll
give further instructions when you've exited.

385
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,589
- I got it.
- You have half an hour.

386
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,955
You know what would happen if you're late.

387
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,792
I understand.

388
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:54,277
CTU has the signal.
They're monitoring the device.

389
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,637
We're set. Let's go.

390
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:02,714
You're taking a risk. If this goes sour,
it could start a firestorm. And for what?

391
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:06,429
- You wouldn't do the same thing?
- I don't mix relationships with my job.

392
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:09,239
Whatever you had with this woman,
I hope it's worth it.

393
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:13,108
This isn't about what I had with a woman.
Her name is Audrey Raines.

394
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:18,433
She served this country with honour.
We owe her. So get in the truck.

395
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,751
<i>(knock at door)</i>

396
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,751
Come in.

397
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,030
You wanted to see me?

398
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,111
Close the door.

399
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:57,153
The president has just... asked me to resign.

400
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:02,154
- What?
- And I am going to comply with his request.

401
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,437
I wanted to tell you personally
before you found out from someone else.

402
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:14,799
I don't understand. Why go along with this?
Why don't you just tell him that you refuse?

403
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,758
He has a tape of our conversation,

404
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,513
the one where we
conspired to commit perjury,

405
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:24,991
and he's threatening
to use it against me unless I step down.

406
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:28,197
- Oh, my God.
- Tom Lennox recorded it.

407
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:33,993
Bottom line is,
I'm not... being given a choice here.

408
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,196
This is all my fault.

409
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:42,590
If I hadn't asked you to lie,
none of this would be happening.

410
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:45,592
You were trying to protect me.
I could have turned you down.

411
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:48,478
Don't... blame yourself.

412
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,908
Noah...

413
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,991
I'm so sorry.

414
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,394
I don't know what to say.

415
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,749
Ah, hell...

416
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:08,435
at least we'll have
a lot more time to spend together.

417
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,069
The president said it would take a week.

418
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,878
But I want this...

419
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,475
letter of resignation in his hands

420
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:28,348
by the time he finishes his press conference.

421
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,629
I am through being the loyal opposition.

422
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:42,436
<i>(woman) Ladies and gentlemen,
the President of the United States.</i>

423
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,151
Please sit.

424
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:52,074
First, I wanna say
that I am grateful to report that Abu Fayed,

425
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:56,073
the man responsible for these attacks,
has been killed,

426
00:30:56,160 --> 00:31:00,358
and that all nuclear devices
have been recovered.

427
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:03,159
I want to acknowledge
the brave men and women

428
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:09,156
in our various law-enforcement agencies,
and let us not forget our armed services.

429
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:13,279
<i>All these people have worked so hard
to bring this crisis to an end.</i>

430
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:17,114
<i>Their dedication, their perseverance,
is without equal.</i>

431
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,236
Despite the brutality of these attacks,

432
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:23,313
<i>we did not allow the violence,
borne of extremism, to push us to extremes.</i>

433
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:29,475
And as Americans, we can and should
take pride and comfort in that fact.

434
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:35,234
Let me, uh, conclude
by asking for your prayers tonight,

435
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:38,710
for all those who grieve this day,

436
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:41,917
for all those whose lives have been shattered.

437
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,434
Let us reach out and begin rebuilding.

438
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:49,071
Let us reach out
and begin the process of national healing.

439
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:52,835
Thank you.
I'll take some of your questions now.

440
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,273
Yes. Ian.

441
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:57,238
Mr President,
how certain are you that the crisis is over,

442
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,515
and there are no more weapons on our soil?

443
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,717
Based on the intelligence,
I can say with full confidence

444
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:06,713
that the worst has passed and
the individuals responsible for these attacks

445
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,030
have been apprehended or else killed.

446
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,076
Yes, Andrea.

447
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,559
Robin, sir.

448
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:17,111
Robin, yes. Robin. I'm sorry.
It's been a very long day. Please, go ahead.

449
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,192
Mr President, there are
several thousand Muslim Americans

450
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:25,035
being held in detention facilities across the
country. What will happen to these people?

451
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:30,194
I've already directed Homeland Security to
begin dismantling these detention facilities.

452
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:35,513
All detainees are to be released
once the immediate crisis has passed.

453
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,717
<i>Excuse me...
Um, now that the crisis has passed,</i>

454
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:42,634
we will be, uh, we will be reviewing the, uh,

455
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:47,350
situation regarding individuals
that we have in custody.

456
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,556
I'm sorry. I'm not being very clear.

457
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:53,269
Uh, let me say again
regarding your question, Andrea,

458
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,749
that, uh... Robin. I'm sorry. Robin.

459
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:59,833
Let me say again regarding...
regarding your question that the, uh...

460
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:04,273
the, uh... detention facilities...

461
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:06,590
<i>...that... that... that we will...</i>

462
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,875
<i>(stutters incoherently)</i>

463
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:14,268
<i>We're going to... (groans)</i>

464
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:18,192
<i>(woman) Call Medical right away.</i>

465
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:20,271
<i>(confused chatter)</i>

466
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:27,876
<i>(man) Ladies and gentlemen, we need to
clear this room. Please exit by the south door.</i>

467
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:57,789
All signs indicate the president
has suffered a cerebral haemorrhage

468
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:00,189
brought on by injuries he sustained earlier.

469
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:03,078
Meaning he shouldn't have
been brought out of the coma.

470
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:05,594
However detrimental
that decision was to him,

471
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:09,958
I'm confident that, in light of his actions
today, he would continue to support it.

472
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,600
I'm glad you're so confident, Karen,

473
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:15,752
since it was your reckless action
that resulted in his stroke.

474
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:20,311
It's unclear if the stroke was inevitable,
but in any event, I'll take responsibility.

475
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:25,155
Excuse me. Now is not the time for
recriminations, self-imposed or otherwise.

476
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:28,949
When will we know the extent of the damage
and the prospects for recovery?

477
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,996
After the MRI.

478
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:34,356
He's being prepped for transport
to Bethesda as we speak.

479
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:37,989
Based on my impressions,
the damage was severe.

480
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:41,868
We can't expect the president
to regain consciousness any time soon.

481
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:47,910
So it is incontestable. Wayne Palmer won't
be able to continue as Commander in Chief.

482
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:57,397
There's no denying that this is
a great tragedy for the nation and...

483
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:01,712
for those of us
who know the president personally.

484
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:05,793
- Just take care of him, Doctor.
- Of course.

485
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,871
Excuse me.

486
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:17,072
Notify the Senate. Have the SecDef
and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs

487
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:19,594
authorise me under the 25th Amendment.

488
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,238
Yes, sir.

489
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:25,438
Tom, have the press secretary
issue a statement.

490
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:29,798
President Palmer's been... incapacitated.

491
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:33,190
No need for alarm.
Executive authority's been transferred to me.

492
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,477
Our... hopes and prayers are with him.

493
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,039
All right, sir.

494
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:42,955
And I'll also need you available to
review everything on the president's agenda.

495
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,075
All right, sir.

496
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,948
There's something on the agenda
you'll want immediate clarification on.

497
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,871
What's that?

498
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,951
Wayne Palmerjust issued a finding

499
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:55,749
allowing Jack Bauer to hand
Russian technology over to the Chinese

500
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:59,992
in exchange
for the return of a covertly held hostage.

501
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:06,279
- Can you explain this?
- Yes, that was a personal request from Bauer.

502
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:10,035
They have a long-standing relationship.
As Jack Bauer was responsible

503
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:14,511
for recovering the suitcase nukes today,
the president wanted to honour his service.

504
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:18,957
Karen, I asked you to explain it, not excuse it.

505
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,598
Understood.

506
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:25,470
Bauer has guaranteed that the technology
will not fall into the hands of the Chinese.

507
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:28,074
It will only be used to secure the hostage.

508
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:31,038
Incidentally, sir,
the hostage is Audrey Raines,

509
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:33,714
daughter of James Heller.

510
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:37,031
Even Jack Bauer
can't guarantee that outcome.

511
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:42,638
Now, I am happy to honour
Agent Bauer's service to this country,

512
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:47,589
but not at the risk of giving
classified technology to the Chinese,

513
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:51,639
and potentially damaging
our relationship with Russia in the process.

514
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:54,518
You tell CTU to stop Bauer immediately.

515
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,909
Sir, the president expressly...

516
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,434
That's all for now, Karen.

517
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,715
You too, Tom.

518
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,152
Unbelievable!

519
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:22,552
Less than a minute behind his desk,
and he's disregarding the president's wishes.

520
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:26,918
But we both share Daniels' unease at
handing military secrets over to the Chinese.

521
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,036
I know, Tom, but that is not the point.

522
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:34,399
No, here's the point. Daniels is now the
acting president, whether we like it or not.

523
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:37,230
I'm off to the hospital.

524
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,550
I'll see you there.

525
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,271
<i>(phone rings)</i>

526
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,430
- Buchanan.
- Hi, it's me.

527
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:51,273
- How's President Palmer?
- Not good.

528
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,590
The doctor says that he has a haemorrhage.

529
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:58,276
They don't know the extent of the damage,
but obviously he's not able to serve.

530
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,874
Daniels is going to assume the office.

531
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,316
<i>And the first wave of his hand,
he wants to stop Jack's operation.</i>

532
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,710
Jack has to return to CTU
as soon as possible with the component.

533
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:11,395
Does he understand the circumstances
under which Palmer agreed to it?

534
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:15,075
No, he's not that kind of a man.
He doesn't operate in shades of grey.

535
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:17,151
Jack won't give up without a fight.

536
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:21,392
You just have to get Jack back to CTU
as soon as possible, OK?

537
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,869
OK, I'll take care of it.

538
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:32,079
Listen up. The White House
has ordered us to shut down Jack's operation.

539
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,549
- How far away are support teams?
- Six miles.

540
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:40,158
Have them standing by, ready to move in.
Contact CHP. Have them set up roadblocks.

541
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,750
Chloe, I want you to stand down on this.

542
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:46,196
- Why?
- You've shown me I can't trust you.

543
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:49,113
- Morris, you cover comm.
- Jack won't go along with this.

544
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,270
I know.

545
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:57,471
<i>(phone rings)</i>

546
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:01,757
<i>- Doyle.
- Mike, it's Bill. Can Jack hear you? Yes or no.</i>

547
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,229
- Yes.
- There's been a change of profile.

548
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,197
Noah Daniels is acting president.

549
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:09,477
He wants the operation shut down
and Jack brought back to CTU.

550
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,994
- Understood.
- What's your current location?

551
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:15,152
We're about two miles east
of the 180 interchange.

552
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:19,074
OK, I need you to exit at the 70.
Make the first left.

553
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:23,438
We'll have a backup team ready to take Jack
into custody and recover the component.

554
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,475
All right.

555
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:28,473
Disarm Jack as quickly and quietly
as possible before he finds out.

556
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,391
No problem.

557
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:36,158
<i>(sighs) CTU has got a report from Caltrans.
The 180 is closed due to high winds.</i>

558
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:41,268
They're concerned about possible fallout.
They want us to take 70 instead.

559
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,588
Fine.

560
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:47,716
- Don't you move.
- Jack, what's the problem?

561
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:51,349
Earlier today, I shot my own partner,

562
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:55,911
a friend of mine, because he tried
to stop me from doing what I have to do.

563
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,788
Don't think for a second
I won't do that to you.

564
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:02,553
Slowly, I want you to pull over.

565
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:03,629
Now.

566
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:41,950
Take the keys out, put them
on the centre consol and give me your phone.

567
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:44,508
Jack, you don't wanna do this.

568
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:56,197
Slowly get out of the truck.
Back up towards the fence.

569
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:59,113
Daniels is the acting president.
He called this off.

570
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:02,317
- Shut up and grab the fence!
- This is gonna end badly, Jack.

571
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,277
You can't go against the White House!

572
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:06,590
<i>- (car starts)
- Jack!</i>

573
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,437
Jack!
