1
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,672
- Excuse me, Miss Driscoll.
- What is it, Chloe?

2
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:26,355
Intelligence indicated the possibility
of an attack at eight this morning.

3
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:31,309
A Turkish national on the FBI watch list,
Tomas Sherek, was last seen in the city.

4
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,549
It's Tomas.

5
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,996
- Did Dar get the briefcase?
- Yes. He's on his way to you now.

6
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:39,198
So far, everything is on schedule.

7
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,670
The briefcase is on its way. When it gets here,
you'll take it to the warehouse.

8
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:45,399
What we will accomplish today
will change the world.

9
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,756
We're fortunate that our family
has been chosen to do this.

10
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,431
I found something on the Net
I think you should know about.

11
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,830
I think someone's positioning code
for a major Internet attack.

12
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,354
The thing is, not all
the code remarks are in English.

13
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,113
- What language were they in?
- Arabic or Turkish, maybe.

14
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,077
What did you find?

15
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,833
- It was my friend, not me.
- What's his name?

16
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,071
Andrew Paige.

17
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,192
- Is it gonna be uncomfortable?
- What?

18
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,748
Going back to CTU. Seeing Driscoll again.

19
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,389
- I don't blame her for her decision.
- She forced you out of CTU.

20
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:26,031
I could have joined other agencies
if I still wanted to do field work. But I didn't.

21
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,873
- I know this guy.
- Fortunately for you, Jack,

22
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,473
it's our problem, not yours.

23
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,757
Erin, listen to me. This doesn't make sense.

24
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,197
He wouldn't risk exposing himself here in the
US for a train bombing. It's not big enough.

25
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,589
We'll consider that when we interrogate him.

26
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:46,596
I am not messing with you. You are gonna
tell me. What is happening at eight o'clock?

27
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,957
- Jack!
- What is your primary objective?

28
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,235
Secretary of Defense!

29
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,269
Heller.

30
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,794
Did it ever occur to you
that these people are using you?

31
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:03,591
Don't you realise they're letting you speak
for one reason? Because you are my son!

32
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,268
Audrey, it's Jack. Are you still at Richard's?

33
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,194
Get your father out of there now!
Your father is the real target.

34
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,430
Oh, my God.

35
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,914
Jack!

36
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,313
Audrey?

37
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,077
Audrey!

38
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,231
Richard Heller?

39
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,675
They took my father and my sister.

40
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,995
Come on!

41
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,915
It's been over five minutes.
You need to widen your perimeter.

42
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,233
You're not listening to me. I'm not interested
in local law enforcement. Get Secret Service.

43
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,675
- Good. Get back to me.
Everyone.

44
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,149
Everyone, please listen up.

45
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,630
Secretary of Defense Heller
was abducted a few minutes ago,

46
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:55,429
along with his senior policy analyst,
Audrey Raines.

47
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,080
He was at his son Richard's house
when he was taken.

48
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:02,915
LAPD is bringing Richard in for questioning.
This is a top-priority situation.

49
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,152
I want all interagency protocols
activated immediately.

50
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:12,150
Move off that page.
Link up to the Secret Service channel.

51
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,879
- It's not that simple. We're locked out.
- Why?

52
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:18,794
- They're sequestering the cabinet.
- Driscoll wants the protocols activated.

53
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:24,398
- What do you want me to do?
- Break through those channels. Hack in.

54
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,916
Chloe, move everything from the bombing
to the secondary server.

55
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,993
- I did that already.
- Then sync up the kidnapping and bombing.

56
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,710
I did that too, but I haven't opened a pipe to
the Army Criminal Investigation Division yet.

57
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,030
- Do it.
- On my way to.

58
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,033
I'm looking at it. They widened the perimeter.
Any ID on transportation?

59
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,192
- <i> I'm working on it... </i>
- I'm gonna have to get back to you.

60
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:49,397
- I need to speak to you.
- You're done here. I'm detaining you.

61
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:54,873
Erin, listen! Heller is my responsibility. I need
you to reinstate me on a provisional basis

62
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,509
- until I get him back.
- You don't give me orders, Jack.

63
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,195
I'm detaining you until an investigator
can take your statement.

64
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:06,910
I'll recommend you're arrested for torturing
a suspect and rendering him useless.

65
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,629
You were getting nowhere.
Because of me, Sherek told you all he knows.

66
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,473
You'd better hope so.

67
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,394
Would you please escort Mr Bauer
to a vacant office until Division gets here?

68
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:20,631
I'm fine. You're making a mistake.

69
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,518
Excuse me. President Keeler.

70
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,114
- What about him?
- He wants to talk to you.

71
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,952
All right.

72
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,755
- This is Erin Driscoll.
- <i> Please hold for the president. </i>

73
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,274
Tell me about the attack on the secretary.

74
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,397
We know that he was taken
approximately ten minutes ago.

75
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:46,871
- You had any contact from the kidnappers?
- No, sir. We have not.

76
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,350
How is it that Secret Service
wasn't able to protect him?

77
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:53,318
I understand that
he broke his schedule to visit his son.

78
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,358
Somehow, the kidnappers
had access to that information.

79
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,193
We're looking into that now.

80
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,432
All right. We're going to go
to an elevated level of security.

81
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,478
- Take the appropriate measures.
- <i>I understand. </i>

82
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,472
- Get them back, Erin.
- We're doing everything we can, sir.

83
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,799
- Hello.
- Mom?

84
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,235
- <i>Hi, sweetie. I didn't... </i>
- Mom, listen.

85
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:20,153
- Get out of the house now.
- What are you talking about?

86
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,152
Someone's looking for me
and they might come for you next.

87
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:27,870
- What kind of trouble are you in?
- I don't know. I found something on the Net.

88
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:31,475
- Now these people are after me.
- Andrew, you are being paranoid.

89
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,792
Mom, they killed Melanie.
They killed everybody in the office.

90
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:39,839
- What?
- They shot 'em. Mom, I'm really scared.

91
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:43,037
Oh, my God. I'm gonna call the police.

92
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,875
Just get outta there! Get to one of your
friends' houses and stay there! Go! Go now!

93
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,757
Andrew!

94
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:20,310
- I said Driscoll wanted me to question you.
- What's going on? What are you doing?

95
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,234
I'll probably get in trouble, but I don't care.

96
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:26,357
- I may have a way to find Heller.
- Why are you telling me?

97
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:32,436
I don't think Driscoll's handling this
the right way and I don't trust her, I trust you.

98
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,591
Sit down.

99
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:43,314
A friend of mine called about 40 minutes ago,
someone I went to school with.

100
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,597
- He wouldn't call me unless it was serious.
- What is it?

101
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,478
He noticed computer code
planted on the Internet.

102
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:53,678
- How is that connected to Heller?
- It originated in Turkey, like everything else,

103
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,991
- Sherek, the train bombing.
- Where is your friend now?

104
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,957
<i> You can see them taking Secretary</i>
<i>Heller's son away from the scene now. </i>

105
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:14,192
<i>That's being done for his own protection,</i>
<i>according to police sources. </i>

106
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:18,831
<i>Those same sources tell us that at least</i>
<i>five Secret Service agents were shot... </i>

107
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,270
- Hello.
- <i> Andrew, it's me. </i>

108
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:30,273
- What did you do, Chloe? Who did you tell?
- What do you mean?

109
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:34,717
Everyone's dead. They're dead.
Now they're trying to kill me.

110
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:39,749
- Talk to me. Who's dead? What happened?
- Everyone's dead. They're dead.

111
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,673
After I called you, I went back to my office.

112
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,228
There was a guy there torturing Melanie.

113
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,710
He wanted to know
who hacked into their system.

114
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,438
And then he shot her.

115
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,397
Oh, my God.

116
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,630
- Who shot her?
- Who's this?

117
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,439
Jack Bauer.
I work for Secretary of Defense Heller.

118
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:00,239
- Andrew, we need your help.
- What?

119
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,959
Heller was kidnapped
less than half an hour ago.

120
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,589
<i>I believe the same people</i>
<i>that kidnapped him are chasing you now. </i>

121
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:10,036
- <i>I don't know anything. </i>
- <i>Son, you've been targeted for a reason. </i>

122
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,918
You know more than you think.

123
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,915
- What do I do?
- <i>Where are you?</i>

124
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,878
<i>I'm at Union Station. I'm getting outta town. </i>

125
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:25,671
No. You stay put. The best thing
you can do right now is let me bring you in.

126
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,911
- Chloe, what should I do?
- You can trust Jack.

127
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,712
OK.

128
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,837
I'll be next to track three
at the bottom of the ramp.

129
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:39,309
Andrew, what are you wearing?

130
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:45,314
Blue jeans, brown jacket and a black bag.

131
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:49,757
OK, you stay put.
I'll be there in about 30 minutes.

132
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,239
<i>OK.</i>

133
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:57,720
This is all my fault. I shouldn't have let
Driscoll talk me in to handing it to the FBI.

134
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:01,429
- She did what?
- She told me to give it to the FBI.

135
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,678
- <i> Yes. </i>
- I found out who stumbled onto our server.

136
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,877
- Is he with you now?
- No. I'll have him shortly.

137
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:33,794
- Find out who he's talked to.
- Of course.

138
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,678
- And then kill him.
- Yeah.

139
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,034
- Is everything in there?
- Yes.

140
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,999
- Where's Behrooz?
- Upstairs, checking traffic on line.

141
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:54,197
It's almost time for him to go.

142
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:58,239
Are you sure you don't want me
to take the briefcase to Omar?

143
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,154
The plan is in place. I don't want to deviate.

144
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,594
Why?

145
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:07,752
This is the key
to everything we're doing today.

146
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,195
It's a lot to entrust to a teenager.

147
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:14,034
I told you. Our whereabouts
have to be accounted for today.

148
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:19,956
Besides, it's because he's a teenager
that he won't arouse suspicion.

149
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,871
You're right.

150
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,038
Don't worry, Dina.

151
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,509
We prepared well for today.

152
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,874
The train. The kidnapping.
It's all gone as expected.

153
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,512
I spoke with Omar. He's happy.

154
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:44,832
And he knows Behrooz is the one
who will deliver the device?

155
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,911
Yes, he knows.

156
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,314
Behrooz will be fine.

157
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:07,072
We're looking to find a connection between
the bombing and Heller's abduction. Sarah.

158
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:11,392
NTSB has given us a full passenger list.
We're processing those names now.

159
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:15,189
What about Heller's son? Is it possible
he had something to do with this?

160
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:19,478
We're not counting anything out.
He's being brought here for questioning now.

161
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:23,109
Erin, I need to speak with you.
Privately, please.

162
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,431
- You're testing me, Jack.
- Erin, please.

163
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:34,716
Curtis will hand out assignment protocols.
I want status reports every 15 minutes.

164
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:49,360
I have information you ignored that seems to
be connected to the bombing and kidnapping.

165
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,432
- What information?
- A computer programmer, Andrew Paige,

166
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:55,478
accidentally came across
a possible Internet strike.

167
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:59,155
- I know. It was passed on to the FBI.
- Yes. Against CTU protocol.

168
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:02,915
You abandoned an active investigation
during a terrorist strike.

169
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,276
I got confirmation from the LAPD
that Andrew Paige's co-workers

170
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:10,148
were all found dead less than 20 minutes ago.

171
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,073
I'll coordinate with FBI
and we'll investigate that.

172
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:16,835
No, you won't. I talked to the kid.
I'm the only one who knows where he is.

173
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:21,118
You want that kid picked up,
you're gonna have to reinstate me.

174
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,796
- I'm having you locked up for impeding me.
- You do that and I'll tell the president

175
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:30,158
that you had Sherek in custody over half
an hour before Heller was even kidnapped,

176
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,391
and you couldn't break him, I did.

177
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,435
Are you threatening me, Jack?

178
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,791
I am asking you to let me
help rescue Secretary Heller.

179
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,872
This is how it's gonna work.

180
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:06,033
I'll reinstate your commission
on a temporary basis until Heller is safe.

181
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,634
You will not make any unilateral decisions.

182
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:13,316
You will work as an auxiliary agent
under the authority of Ronnie Lobell.

183
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:17,279
And then I'll hand you over to Division.

184
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,031
- What are they gonna do?
- I don't know,

185
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,874
but if they wanted me dead,
they would have killed me at Richard's house.

186
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,996
Richard. God.

187
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:40,277
He was still in the house.
I don't think they went in there.

188
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:43,796
Listen to me, Audy.
No matter what happens to me,

189
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:47,190
they have no reason to hurt you.

190
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,875
- They don't need a reason.
- And I don't want you to give 'em one.

191
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,996
Do what they say.

192
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:56,231
Whatever happens to me, don't provoke them.

193
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:01,633
If they threaten me, if they hurt me,
even if they kill me...

194
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,109
do what they say.

195
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,710
I only asked for Heller.

196
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:19,236
I didn't want to kill her
without your permission.

197
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,637
- Dad!
- Leave her alone! Don't you touch her!

198
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,553
- So help me God, I will kill you!
- Dad!

199
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:31,872
- Son of a bitch! I'll kill you!
- Omar! Yes or no?

200
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:35,077
Do not do this! Leave her alone.

201
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,993
Not yet.

202
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,510
We may be able to use her.

203
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,555
Take them away.

204
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,631
Dad. Dad.

205
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,989
I'm going with Ronnie to pick up Andrew.

206
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,071
- Has Driscoll cleared you?
- Yeah.

207
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:16,914
That's unlike her. I hope you didn't
tell her I gave you the information.

208
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,993
I didn't. Have we heard anything from
any agents that survived the kidnapping?

209
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,958
- There's one. He's in surgery.
- Any other witnesses?

210
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,918
The son, Richard.
They're bringing him in now.

211
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,197
Get back to me as soon as you've got
anything on Heller or Audrey.

212
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:35,115
Sure. Bad luck about Audrey being there
when her dad got kidnapped.

213
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,997
Yeah.

214
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:43,750
I'm going to my car to get my things.

215
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,990
OK, so let me understand this.

216
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,390
Bauer illegally shoots a suspect
and you let him back in the field?

217
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:53,234
He'll only give us the location
if I let him work it.

218
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:58,872
- He can't hold back information, Erin.
- We don't have time to interrogate him.

219
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,312
It's a simple job.
You pick up the subject and bring him in.

220
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,837
Bauer has not been in the field for
a year and a half. That has consequences...

221
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:13,029
Which is why I need you to keep him
on a tight leash. It's not optional, it's an order.

222
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,553
Fine.

223
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,875
I'm ready to go.

224
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:37,436
This is a simple task, Behrooz. But these
are the ones where mistakes can be made.

225
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:42,275
Drive carefully. If there is anyone
in the area who looks suspicious,

226
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:45,432
drive away and call us. Understood?

227
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,317
Yes.

228
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,792
- Hello.
- Mrs Araz, this is Debbie.

229
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:00,279
Yes, Debbie, what can I do for you?

230
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:05,229
- Can I please talk to Behrooz?
- Let me see if he's here. Hold on.

231
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:10,550
- What does she want?
- I don't know.

232
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,629
Debbie?

233
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,837
I've left messages on your cellphone.
Why haven't you called?

234
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,798
- I'm sorry, I've been busy.
- Doing what?

235
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,193
Working for my father.

236
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:27,591
I don't believe you. If you're seeing someone
else, at least have the decency to tell me.

237
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,830
I'm not seeing anyone else.

238
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,388
- Then why are you avoiding me?
- I'm not.

239
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:37,997
- This isn't the right time to do this.
- That's what I mean. You're still avoiding me.

240
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,071
I'm not.

241
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,879
Then why can't we talk now?

242
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,155
Because I can't.

243
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,959
- I've gotta go.
- Behrooz!

244
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,877
Behrooz.

245
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,958
That's not the right way
to deal with this situation.

246
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:01,795
This girl needs to know it's over
and that there will be no more phone calls.

247
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:07,352
I'll take care of it later.
I don't wanna be late getting this to Omar.

248
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:20,277
- You sent Jack Bauer out in the field?
- He'll be with Ronnie.

249
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:23,113
- Yeah, but why?
- He knows our procedures.

250
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,237
And he may have information about Heller.
What is it, Chloe?

251
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:31,394
Curtis, you wanted to know when Richard
Heller arrived. He's on his way to Holding.

252
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,756
Thanks. Do you want me
to choreograph the jurisdictions?

253
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:40,790
No, I'll do it. Find out what the son knows.
Chloe, I'd like to talk to you.

254
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,599
Has it occurred to you
that we might be farther along

255
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:47,558
if you trusted me
half as much as you trust Jack Bauer?

256
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:52,031
Miss Driscoll, I'm not in the mood to play
the scared student at the principal's office.

257
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:55,317
I came to you with information
that my friend Andrew gave to me

258
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:58,119
and you chose to not respond to it.

259
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:02,990
When you came to me with the information,
we were looking for Sherek, were we not?

260
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:06,311
- Yes.
- Wasn't he our most important lead then?

261
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,517
- I guess.
- Then my question to you is...

262
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:15,550
once we had Sherek in custody, if you felt
that your Internet lead was still valuable,

263
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,234
why didn't you reprise it?

264
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,476
You're right.
I felt more comfortable going to Jack.

265
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:26,358
Well, at least that's honest.

266
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,478
You can go back to work now.

267
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:45,036
Check that, please.

268
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:50,275
For the record, I think Driscoll
made a mistake letting you come.

269
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:53,318
- All right.
- And just so we're clear, I give the orders.

270
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,710
I'm fine with that. What happened
earlier in Holding with Sherek,

271
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,633
I had intel and had no time
to do it another way. I'm sorry.

272
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:05,636
Apology accepted. But if you try to exceed
my authority again, I will stop you cold.

273
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:30,755
Fine. Have Marcy isolate all the death threats
Heller's received over the last six months.

274
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:35,516
I want phone calls, emails, snail mail,
everything sent over to CTU for analysis.

275
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,273
Well, for the time being,
I'm working with them.

276
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:41,432
Yeah. OK, good, thanks.

277
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:48,033
- Has Heller had a lot of death threats lately?
- No more than anyone else in the cabinet.

278
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,914
So what's it like working in DC?

279
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,710
For the most part, we solve problems
in theory that'll never come into play.

280
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,872
- Then why do it?
- I've got my reasons.

281
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:07,311
Hey, man. I'm just trying
to make some conversation.

282
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:13,591
I read your file. It must have really
burned you up when Driscoll fired you.

283
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:16,148
She did me a favour.
I wanted to get my life back.

284
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,437
I wouldn't have been able to
if I was still doing field work.

285
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:23,274
How's the master plan going?
Do you have a life yet?

286
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,599
Yeah.

287
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,789
Yeah, I got a life.

288
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,239
We'll be fine, Audy.
We're still on US soil.

289
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:52,599
That's not gonna help us
if this is some sort of suicide mission.

290
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:56,233
You said Jack tried to warn you
before they grabbed us.

291
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,392
Yeah. That's right.

292
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:05,669
That means he must have a reliable source,
which means our chances are good.

293
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,515
Audy, sit down.

294
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:23,948
I am your father.
Do you trust me?

295
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,315
- Of course I do.
- Then listen.

296
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,871
You cannot allow a negative thought
to enter your head now.

297
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:35,112
They will find us.
We will be rescued. Say it.

298
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,876
- Please, Dad, don't.
- We will be rescued. Say it, Audy.

299
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:46,116
- We will be rescued.
- We will be rescued.

300
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,796
Take off your clothes.

301
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,235
You first.

302
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:11,709
Take off your clothes.

303
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,557
OK.

304
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,511
Go to hell.

305
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,671
Stop it. Dad.

306
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:25,431
- <i> Who is it?</i>
- It's Behrooz.

307
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,797
Behrooz.

308
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:02,475
Good job, Behrooz.

309
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,714
- Debbie, what are you doing here?
- I followed you.

310
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,836
- Why?
- Cos I didn't believe you.

311
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,070
I thought you were seeing someone else.

312
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:42,073
Look around. Does it look
like I'm seeing anybody else?

313
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:47,757
You shouldn't be here. I'm working for my
father. He doesn't like me socialising at work.

314
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,991
OK. I get it.

315
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:54,755
That doesn't explain
why you stopped calling me.

316
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,155
It's my parents.

317
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:02,199
They've got a problem
with me seeing someone that's...

318
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,469
Not Muslim?

319
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,673
Yeah.

320
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:12,037
- And that's it? Whatever they say, you do?
- No.

321
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:15,192
Then what's going on between us?
Do you wanna be with me or not?

322
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,669
- I do, but...
- But what?

323
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:23,273
Debbie, I wanna straighten things out,
but I can't do it now.

324
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,794
We'll get together later.

325
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,438
Debbie, please.

326
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:05,756
- Is everything ready for Richard Heller?
- Just about. They're starting to hook him up.

327
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,274
Then let's do it.

328
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:12,035
Does Driscoll know you're subjecting
Heller's son to a lie detector?

329
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,792
- Yeah.
- Is he a suspect?

330
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:19,671
Not exactly, but he's on very poor terms with
his father. I wouldn't wanna rule anything out.

331
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:25,437
- You want to be in the room on this?
- No, I'll observe through the one-way.

332
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:34,431
- What are you doing? What are you doing?
- We wanna make sure you're telling the truth.

333
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:38,877
Why would I lie to you? My father
and my sister have just been kidnapped.

334
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,191
Please sit back, Richard,
or I'll have to sedate you.

335
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:46,831
You can't do this to me.
My father is the secretary of defense.

336
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:49,354
<i>I understand. </i>
<i>But according to my information,</i>

337
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:53,513
you were about to unleash personal attacks
on your father at a rally at Lockheed.

338
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:57,832
Are you insane? This is America.
I can say what I want in public.

339
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:01,390
- How dare you treat me like a criminal.
- I'm not.

340
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:04,552
You wanna be constructive?
Find my father and my sister.

341
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:08,792
- We intend to.
- By treating me like I'm guilty of something!

342
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:13,795
Richard, right now, you are the only witness
to your father and your sister's kidnapping.

343
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:16,713
- We need your help.
- Then get these things off of me

344
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:20,031
and start talking to me
like a normal human being.

345
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:24,591
- You don't have anything to hide, do you?
- No.

346
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,875
How's the polygraph?

347
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,155
100 per cent.

348
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,918
Father.

349
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:50,434
How did everything go?

350
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,909
It went fine.

351
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:07,071
Omar said one of his men saw you
with someone outside the compound.

352
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:10,914
- A young woman.
- I was going to tell you.

353
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,751
Who was it?

354
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:20,071
- Debbie.
- Where is she now?

355
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:25,393
- She didn't see anything.
- She saw you at the compound. It's enough.

356
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:31,438
We've spent years planning for this,
waiting for this day to come.

357
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:34,318
Now it's here
and you've compromised everything.

358
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:38,598
She didn't see anything.
I made sure of it.

359
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:41,513
We'll see how much she knows.

360
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,239
Call her and tell her to come here.

361
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:50,316
- Please don't do this. It's not necessary.
- I decide what's necessary, not you.

362
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:56,390
- What are you going to do to her?
- Since when do you question me?

363
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:02,157
How long have we lived in this country,
preparing for this day?

364
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,312
How long?

365
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,118
Four years.

366
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,998
Almost five.

367
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:15,679
That's how much time can be erased
by a simple mistake.

368
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,715
Call her. Now!

369
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,951
Yes, sir.

370
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,909
- Tim Felson. MTA.
- Ronnie Lobell. CTU.

371
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,150
Head of field ops. Where's track three?

372
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:47,109
- East entrance. My guys can lock it down.
- We don't wanna draw attention to anything.

373
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,078
The platform's just at the end of this hall.

374
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,115
- Hello.
- <i> Andrew, it's me. </i>

375
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:09,033
- Where are they?
- On site. They'll be there any minute.

376
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,190
All right. Tell 'em to hurry up.

377
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:16,070
It doesn't work that way. Stay where you are
and I'll talk to you when they bring you in.

378
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:19,357
- Andrew.
- Yeah. Are you Jack Bauer?

379
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:22,113
- Yes. Come on. Let's go.
- Where are we going?

380
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:26,273
I'll explain later. It's not safe here. Let's go.

381
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,637
Just around the corner.

382
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:47,439
- You sure he said the bottom of the ramp?
- Yeah.

383
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,917
- Hello.
- Andrew.

384
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:06,870
- Who's this?
- It's Jack Bauer. Where are you?

385
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,239
<i>Andrew?</i>

386
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:13,073
I can't really... talk.

387
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,755
- Let's go.
- Andrew.

388
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:21,116
Andrew. Son of a bitch.
They got to him before we did.

389
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,192
- How did they know where he would be?
- I don't know.

390
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:30,037
- Who are you?
- I'll kill you if you don't follow my orders.

391
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:34,352
Felson, come on. Alert your MTAs. Tell 'em
we've got a Caucasian male, early 20s,

392
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:37,637
wearing a brown jacket,
being taken from here against his will.

393
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:42,077
Tell your men not to engage the target.
I want a visual and a location. That's it. Now.

394
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,760
Where are you taking me?

395
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:10,393
- This is Marx. I see the target.
- What's your 20?

396
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:16,476
I'm on the train platform. Target is on the
easternmost periphery. Second-level parking.

397
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,312
Open the door.

398
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:21,638
- They're in a dark blue Lexus.
- What's the fastest way?

399
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:24,439
- Out the back.
- Tell your men to stay out of sight.

400
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:27,512
<i>Stay on the guy,</i>
<i>but make sure he doesn't see you. </i>

401
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:33,279
Lay down.

402
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:20,876
There he is. You get the gate.
I'll get the kid out of the car.

403
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,599
- Wait.
- Wait for what?

404
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,433
- This isn't the right play.
- What?

405
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:30,877
- If we follow him, he may lead us to Heller.
- Or maybe he won't, but he'll kill the kid.

406
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:35,715
Right now, this hostile's
our best chance to find Secretary Heller.

407
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:40,313
- We'll break him back at CTU.
- You don't know if you can break him in time.

408
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,710
This is not a field ops call, Jack.

409
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,268
We need authorisation.

410
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:51,428
I can't take the chance
of Driscoll resisting me.

411
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,754
- I told you not to go against me, Jack.
- Ronnie, please.

412
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:08,638
You get up.
Interlace your hands behind your head.

413
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:11,837
- You're making a mistake.
- Shut up.

414
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:26,918
<i> Gate four, he's leaving the parking lot. </i>
<i>What do you want me to do?</i>

415
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:34,236
This is Lobell. I'm moving in now. Let the
front car go ahead and lock in the hostile.

416
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,471
Ronnie.

417
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:03,154
Ronnie, where you been hit?

418
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,155
Can you move?

419
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,559
Ronnie.

420
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,757
Give me the keys to the cuffs.

421
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:20,237
Please, Ronnie. He's our only lead.

422
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,709
We gotta stop him.

423
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,830
Come on.

424
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,996
Dammit!

425
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:21,878
<i> So tell me what happened, Richard. </i>

426
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,110
My father and I were talking

427
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,350
and...

428
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:31,752
- my sister came in with a phone call for him.
- He was in the room on the call?

429
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:36,038
- No. He and Audrey went outside.
- All right. Go on.

430
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:39,908
Then I heard an explosion, looked out
the window and saw 'em being grabbed.

431
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,798
And they didn't come in and get you?

432
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,758
I know you told me not to interrupt,
but we need you.

433
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:49,310
- What's going on?
- A webcast is on servers all over the place.

434
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:52,631
- A webcast of what?
- Secretary of Defense Heller.

435
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,832
The terrorists are broadcasting this
all over the Internet.

436
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:59,150
Call Curtis.

437
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:02,038
Curtis, we need you on the floor.

438
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,868
There you are, you son of a bitch.

439
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:35,750
<i> We speak for the men, women and</i>
<i>children who have had no voice until now. </i>

440
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:41,710
<i>Who have been victimised by the genocidal</i>
<i>policies of the US that Heller has advanced. </i>

441
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,318
<i>But the time has come</i>
<i>for the victims to demand justice. </i>

442
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,391
