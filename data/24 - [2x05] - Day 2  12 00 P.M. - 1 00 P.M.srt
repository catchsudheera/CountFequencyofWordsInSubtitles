1
00:00:14,453 --> 00:00:17,286
This is Jenny's statement
to the press about the CTU bombing.

2
00:00:17,373 --> 00:00:20,809
- Any casualties?
- Over a dozen so far.

3
00:00:20,893 --> 00:00:22,963
Those people are dead because of you.

4
00:00:23,053 --> 00:00:27,171
- You're out, Eric. Effective immediately.
- You can't dismiss me now, sir.

5
00:00:27,253 --> 00:00:29,005
I need someone I can trust.

6
00:00:29,373 --> 00:00:32,285
Reza may be involved with a terrorist.

7
00:00:32,373 --> 00:00:36,889
He's been in contact with someone
who finances terrorist operations.

8
00:00:36,973 --> 00:00:39,851
Trust me. He is not a terrorist.

9
00:00:39,933 --> 00:00:44,324
I want you to drop this nonsense and start
treating Reza like a member of the family.

10
00:00:44,413 --> 00:00:46,244
- How bad is she?
- She needs surgery.

11
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:49,564
- We can't do that in the field.
- George, we can't keep her here.

12
00:00:49,653 --> 00:00:54,124
Everything on this nuke has been destroyed
apart from the database Paula sent the NSA,

13
00:00:54,213 --> 00:00:57,683
- and they didn't get the code.
- Assign other IT people to retrieve it.

14
00:00:57,773 --> 00:00:59,092
We don't have time!

15
00:01:00,253 --> 00:01:02,972
- I wanna go with her.
- I have some questions first.

16
00:01:03,053 --> 00:01:06,489
We got out in time.
She wasn't injured in the explosion.

17
00:01:06,573 --> 00:01:09,451
Her head injury most likely
occurred before the blast.

18
00:01:09,533 --> 00:01:13,811
- You don't think I did this?
- I'm gonna let the police sort that out.

19
00:01:14,213 --> 00:01:17,205
Eddie said the job went off without a hitch.
What happened between then and now?

20
00:01:17,293 --> 00:01:21,445
I killed them, for resisting arrest.
I'll kill you, too, Joe.

21
00:01:21,533 --> 00:01:24,093
Whoever set you up to do this job, Joe,
they used you.

22
00:01:24,173 --> 00:01:29,201
The woman who gave me the plans to CTU,
I only met her twice.

23
00:01:29,293 --> 00:01:31,488
I can't go back to jail.

24
00:01:31,573 --> 00:01:32,722
No!

25
00:01:45,933 --> 00:01:49,926
None of these girders are stable.
I can't guarantee they're gonna hold.

26
00:01:50,013 --> 00:01:52,527
And nothing behind this corded area's safe.

27
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:55,650
If I see anyone in here,
I'll shut the building down.

28
00:01:55,733 --> 00:01:58,122
I don't care what the governor says.

29
00:02:01,053 --> 00:02:04,602
No, don't even try that.
The switches were totally destroyed.

30
00:02:04,693 --> 00:02:08,049
See if you can set up
a generator line to the A-Island.

31
00:02:12,093 --> 00:02:15,051
We gotta get her outta here.

32
00:02:16,573 --> 00:02:17,972
Progress here?

33
00:02:18,053 --> 00:02:21,523
We're trying to bring her round
using stimulants and hydrating fluids.

34
00:02:21,613 --> 00:02:26,243
- But it might make her more unstable.
- We're running out of time. Wake her up.

35
00:02:27,373 --> 00:02:29,933
- Where are you headed?
- To follow up on a lead.

36
00:02:30,013 --> 00:02:32,573
There's an LA connection to Syed Ali.

37
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:35,725
Well, look. Send somebody else.
I need you here.

38
00:02:35,813 --> 00:02:38,691
To do what? Watch Paula die?

39
00:02:39,533 --> 00:02:43,162
We gotta get the encryption codes out of her
or we lose everything.

40
00:02:43,253 --> 00:02:46,051
You got it covered.
I'll follow up on this lead.

41
00:02:46,133 --> 00:02:49,489
No. You're gonna stay here,
and that's an order.

42
00:02:49,573 --> 00:02:54,203
There's a Middle Eastern businessman in LA
who's had contact with Syed Ali recently.

43
00:02:54,293 --> 00:02:57,922
Now, Ivers and Nepel are dead.
Who do you want me to send?

44
00:02:59,693 --> 00:03:01,809
Be reachable, all right?

45
00:03:04,013 --> 00:03:06,573
- What are you looking at?
- Nothing.

46
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:10,612
- You putting band-aids on the network?
- Yeah. I'm on it.

47
00:03:10,693 --> 00:03:12,888
Mr Mason? It's Jack Bauer.

48
00:03:14,493 --> 00:03:17,087
- Jack? What is it?
- George, I got to Wald.

49
00:03:17,173 --> 00:03:19,846
I found out who commissioned him
to take out CTU.

50
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:22,731
- Who?
- It was Nina Myers.

51
00:03:22,813 --> 00:03:25,964
- Nina?
- She was his connection to CTU.

52
00:03:26,053 --> 00:03:27,964
It makes no sense. She's been in prison.

53
00:03:28,053 --> 00:03:33,446
He approached her before we took her down.
She sold him schematics, gate information...

54
00:03:33,533 --> 00:03:35,410
This has to be connected to the nuke.

55
00:03:35,493 --> 00:03:38,803
They bombed CTU
to cripple our response capability?

56
00:03:38,893 --> 00:03:41,361
Yes, yes. I've already called Chappelle.

57
00:03:41,453 --> 00:03:43,648
- You what?!
- I couldn't find you, George.

58
00:03:44,293 --> 00:03:46,648
- What did he say?
- He agreed we need to talk to her.

59
00:03:46,733 --> 00:03:50,646
He's having her transferred
over to CTU now for questioning.

60
00:03:50,733 --> 00:03:53,691
Debrief at Division.
It's a total disaster here.

61
00:03:53,773 --> 00:03:56,526
- What are you gonna do about Nina?
- I'll take care of it.

62
00:03:56,613 --> 00:04:01,084
- Don't just hand her over to the FBI.
- Forget it, Jack. You did a great job.

63
00:04:01,173 --> 00:04:03,687
OK? Go find yourself someplace safe.

64
00:04:03,773 --> 00:04:04,842
George...

65
00:04:04,933 --> 00:04:07,970
Michelle, can you get somebody
to set up an interrogation room?

66
00:04:08,053 --> 00:04:10,044
- We got somebody coming in.
- Who?

67
00:04:10,533 --> 00:04:14,446
- Nina Myers.
- The CTU agent that killed Jack's wife?

68
00:04:14,533 --> 00:04:16,922
I need as close to maximum security
as I can get -

69
00:04:17,013 --> 00:04:19,607
and three armed agents standing by.

70
00:04:21,613 --> 00:04:26,448
We've reduced the likelihood on some of the
targets. We're left with six probable sectors.

71
00:04:26,533 --> 00:04:30,651
The harbour, Port of Los Angeles.
One of the busiest ports in the world.

72
00:04:30,773 --> 00:04:33,128
A strike there will knock out infrastructure...

73
00:04:33,213 --> 00:04:36,603
Sorry to interrupt, Mr President,
but the ambassador's about to land.

74
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:39,924
- Any communication while he was en route?
- Not since this morning,

75
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:42,527
- when it was decided he'd come here.
- Is he alone?

76
00:04:42,613 --> 00:04:47,767
No, he's being accompanied by Farhad Salim,
their ranking intelligence officer.

77
00:04:47,853 --> 00:04:51,641
Get me anything new we've learned
about Second Wave since this morning.

78
00:04:51,733 --> 00:04:53,689
Oh, and Lynne.

79
00:04:54,893 --> 00:04:57,885
- Is Roger here yet?
- He's upstairs.

80
00:04:57,973 --> 00:05:01,170
They're bringing him up to speed
on Rayburn's dismissal.

81
00:05:01,253 --> 00:05:03,050
Good.

82
00:05:14,093 --> 00:05:18,132
Dr Lazar to Radiology.
Dr Lazar to Radiology.

83
00:05:44,173 --> 00:05:47,210
Everything's gonna be OK, Kim.

84
00:05:50,733 --> 00:05:52,769
Tell you what.

85
00:05:54,093 --> 00:05:59,565
You leave now, I'll tell the police
that it was just a misunderstanding.

86
00:05:59,653 --> 00:06:02,486
If you don't, they're gonna arrest you.

87
00:06:03,133 --> 00:06:05,931
- Arrest me for what?
- For kidnapping my daughter.

88
00:06:09,133 --> 00:06:11,886
Where is Carla?

89
00:06:11,973 --> 00:06:16,410
As soon as these officers talk to the doctor,
it'll be pretty obvious that you hurt her.

90
00:06:16,493 --> 00:06:19,405
That's a lie and you know it.
I would never hurt her.

91
00:06:19,493 --> 00:06:22,053
I've been protecting her from you.

92
00:06:22,133 --> 00:06:24,966
The only thing that can be proved, Kim,

93
00:06:25,053 --> 00:06:28,807
is that you took Megan
without our permission.

94
00:06:29,813 --> 00:06:33,567
You beat up your wife.
Who's gonna believe you?

95
00:06:33,653 --> 00:06:36,565
Carla will back me up. You know that.

96
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:43,091
I mean, if you don't believe me...

97
00:06:43,173 --> 00:06:45,004
you can give her a call.

98
00:06:45,093 --> 00:06:46,606
Wanna do that?

99
00:06:47,773 --> 00:06:50,606
Go ahead, Kim. Call her.

100
00:06:57,013 --> 00:07:00,369
You walk away, while you have the chance.

101
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:02,887
Otherwise you're going to jail.

102
00:07:03,933 --> 00:07:06,970
Stay away from my family!

103
00:07:07,453 --> 00:07:09,569
Don't ever come to my house again.

104
00:07:19,973 --> 00:07:21,964
I wouldn't rule anything out, Mike.

105
00:07:22,053 --> 00:07:25,250
If you co-opt local enforcement,
the story could leak.

106
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:28,166
And that's one of my biggest concerns here.

107
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:34,561
You know what? Roger's walking in.
I'll talk to you when you land.

108
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:37,767
- Mr President.
- Roger.

109
00:07:37,853 --> 00:07:41,402
It's good to see you. Come into my office.

110
00:07:41,493 --> 00:07:44,212
Afternoon, everyone. Be with you shortly.

111
00:07:44,293 --> 00:07:46,568
Very good, sir.

112
00:07:47,373 --> 00:07:51,924
I can't tell you how disturbed I was
with Eric's decision regarding the CTU.

113
00:07:52,453 --> 00:07:54,569
29 dead - and counting.

114
00:07:54,653 --> 00:08:00,125
It's inexcusable. There'll be a full
investigation, possible criminal charges.

115
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:02,283
You know I hate to meddle in your rice bowl.

116
00:08:02,373 --> 00:08:05,171
But on a day like today,
I couldn't wait for you to arrive.

117
00:08:05,253 --> 00:08:07,847
- Say no more.
- Are you caught up on everything?

118
00:08:07,933 --> 00:08:09,844
Caught up.

119
00:08:09,933 --> 00:08:13,323
I'd like to talk to you
about this meeting with the ambassador.

120
00:08:13,413 --> 00:08:17,804
- What are your thoughts?
- We have everything to lose, nothing to gain.

121
00:08:17,893 --> 00:08:21,408
What we have to gain
is stopping the nuclear bomb.

122
00:08:21,493 --> 00:08:25,042
But this meeting benefits only the other side.

123
00:08:25,133 --> 00:08:30,651
He wants to be able to say to the world
"Look, we tried to stop the bomb."

124
00:08:30,733 --> 00:08:35,932
It's a ploy to gain access
to our intelligence, nothing more.

125
00:08:43,613 --> 00:08:47,401
You might be right.
But I'm not as certain as you are.

126
00:08:49,813 --> 00:08:53,249
- I'm gonna meet with him.
- Very good, sir.

127
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:56,405
- Anything else?
- Not at this time.

128
00:08:57,493 --> 00:09:00,769
Hold on. Sir, off-duty agents
are finally arriving.

129
00:09:00,853 --> 00:09:04,402
And Division called. The chopper
just lifted off, Nina Myers is on board.

130
00:09:04,493 --> 00:09:08,372
Good. Let's set up the mobile video unit
for the interrogation.

131
00:09:08,453 --> 00:09:14,130
Lori, I need you to call downstairs. Get Bill.
Have him bring up a video rack, OK?

132
00:09:27,693 --> 00:09:29,763
Jack? What the hell are you doing here?

133
00:09:29,853 --> 00:09:32,572
- I sent you to Division.
- I wanna do the debrief here.

134
00:09:32,653 --> 00:09:35,725
Nina killed your wife.
I don't want you anywhere near her.

135
00:09:35,813 --> 00:09:38,486
My goal is the same as yours,
to stop this bomb.

136
00:09:38,573 --> 00:09:40,370
It makes sense to do the debrief here

137
00:09:40,453 --> 00:09:45,083
because there is no information
on the Wald op at Division.

138
00:09:45,173 --> 00:09:47,562
Please.

139
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:50,850
All right. Let me set you up
with Noel at tech support.

140
00:09:50,933 --> 00:09:53,049
- What about Ivers?
- Dead.

141
00:09:53,733 --> 00:09:57,692
- Clark?
- Dead. We lost a lot of good people, Jack.

142
00:10:08,653 --> 00:10:12,407
- I'll get started on the debrief.
- Hey. Do us both a favour.

143
00:10:12,973 --> 00:10:14,645
Finish, and go?

144
00:10:16,933 --> 00:10:18,002
Yeah.

145
00:10:20,733 --> 00:10:22,246
She's awake.

146
00:10:23,853 --> 00:10:28,131
You'd better move fast.
I don't know how much time we have.

147
00:10:28,213 --> 00:10:30,249
Paula, it's George Mason.

148
00:10:31,253 --> 00:10:34,006
- Can you hear me?
- What happened?

149
00:10:34,613 --> 00:10:38,242
We had a big explosion.
Do you remember the encryption codes?

150
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:40,722
You're the only one who has 'em.

151
00:10:42,813 --> 00:10:44,724
- Stay with us, Paula.
- Paula.

152
00:10:44,813 --> 00:10:49,250
You were transferring files out to NSA.
Do you remember that?

153
00:10:50,253 --> 00:10:53,370
- Yeah.
- The transfer didn't complete.

154
00:10:53,453 --> 00:10:56,604
They didn't have the source decryption key.

155
00:10:58,613 --> 00:11:01,571
- The source?
- Yeah, the source key. That's right.

156
00:11:01,653 --> 00:11:05,168
Normally you send it in a separate packet,
but the router was destroyed.

157
00:11:05,253 --> 00:11:08,848
Did you make a copy
of the source key before you sent it?

158
00:11:11,213 --> 00:11:13,204
Yeah.

159
00:11:13,653 --> 00:11:16,247
What is it? Do you remember?

160
00:11:17,053 --> 00:11:19,044
- Subvolume.
- OK.

161
00:11:22,013 --> 00:11:25,562
- Which volume?
- Which volume? Which one?

162
00:11:25,653 --> 00:11:27,848
Paula? Stay with us. Which one?

163
00:11:27,933 --> 00:11:32,848
Paula, your disk is partitioned in over
50 volumes. Do you remember which one?

164
00:11:40,693 --> 00:11:41,887
Etudes.

165
00:11:42,013 --> 00:11:44,004
Etudes.

166
00:11:49,133 --> 00:11:51,363
Hang in there, sweetie.

167
00:11:54,053 --> 00:11:57,045
- That's it. That's it.
- Great.

168
00:11:57,133 --> 00:12:01,684
Hey, you did good. What you just did
is gonna save a lot of lives today.

169
00:12:01,773 --> 00:12:04,765
- Let's get her to hospital now.
- Move! Let's go.

170
00:12:09,893 --> 00:12:12,248
She's in VTAC.

171
00:12:14,253 --> 00:12:16,892
Everybody ready? Charge.

172
00:12:16,973 --> 00:12:19,487
- Full charge, 360.
- Clear.

173
00:12:21,053 --> 00:12:23,567
Nothing. Charging at 300.

174
00:12:23,653 --> 00:12:24,972
- My charge.
- Your charge.

175
00:12:25,053 --> 00:12:26,930
Clear.

176
00:12:27,933 --> 00:12:30,288
- No rhythm.
- Flatline.

177
00:12:33,533 --> 00:12:35,649
She's gone.

178
00:13:10,653 --> 00:13:12,052
- I got it.
- You sure?

179
00:13:12,133 --> 00:13:13,930
Yeah.

180
00:13:17,093 --> 00:13:19,687
- Hey.
- So, how d'you like the house?

181
00:13:19,773 --> 00:13:21,923
- You knew about it?
- Of course.

182
00:13:22,013 --> 00:13:24,368
Why do you think I insisted you go with him?

183
00:13:24,453 --> 00:13:27,286
Dad, it's not that I think
Reza doesn't love Marie.

184
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:30,604
- But if he's doing things that are illegal...
- You don't know that.

185
00:13:30,693 --> 00:13:34,208
I know Ralph Burton found
a transaction in the company records

186
00:13:34,293 --> 00:13:38,809
- that links him to a known terrorist.
- Ralph Burton is a PI.

187
00:13:38,893 --> 00:13:43,842
He could probably connect me to
the Manson Family if he looked hard enough.

188
00:13:45,573 --> 00:13:50,283
- Did they straighten out that lunch business?
- Yeah. Another crisis averted.

189
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:53,563
- Who's this?
- Hello, sir.

190
00:13:53,653 --> 00:13:56,326
I'm Tony Almeida from Los Angeles CTU.

191
00:13:56,413 --> 00:13:59,405
- This is Agent Richards.
- CTU. What... what is CTU?

192
00:13:59,493 --> 00:14:01,768
Counter Terrorist Unit.

193
00:14:02,413 --> 00:14:04,324
I'm looking for a Reza Naiyeer.

194
00:14:05,493 --> 00:14:09,202
- What's this all about?
- It's a government matter, ma'am.

195
00:14:09,293 --> 00:14:13,525
- A government matter?
- I just need to ask him a few questions.

196
00:14:13,773 --> 00:14:15,604
Mr Almeida, right?

197
00:14:15,693 --> 00:14:20,164
My daughter hired a private investigator
to do a background check on Reza.

198
00:14:20,253 --> 00:14:24,451
- It's all been cleared up.
- Actually, Dad, it hasn't all been cleared up.

199
00:14:26,693 --> 00:14:31,369
Can this wait? You see, today is
my other daughter Marie's wedding.

200
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:33,967
She's getting married to Reza.

201
00:14:34,053 --> 00:14:36,726
I'm sorry for the bad timing, Mr Warner.

202
00:14:36,813 --> 00:14:39,247
But no. This can't wait.

203
00:14:40,173 --> 00:14:43,245
I'm authorised to interrogate Mr Naiyeer.

204
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:47,485
Are you gonna take me to him,
or do I have to find him myself?

205
00:14:48,933 --> 00:14:51,322
Kate, go find Reza.

206
00:14:58,893 --> 00:15:02,010
- What's going on here?
- I'm part of an investigation

207
00:15:02,093 --> 00:15:04,049
involving national security.

208
00:15:04,133 --> 00:15:06,567
I'm hoping Mr Naiyeer can assist me.

209
00:15:10,653 --> 00:15:12,405
Hi, Kate.

210
00:15:22,013 --> 00:15:23,969
What's up?

211
00:15:24,053 --> 00:15:27,443
- There's a man here who needs to talk to you.
- Who is he?

212
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:30,368
He's from the government.

213
00:15:34,053 --> 00:15:37,932
- The government?
- A counter-terrorism agency?

214
00:15:40,653 --> 00:15:43,929
- What are you talking about?
- That's all I know.

215
00:15:50,893 --> 00:15:52,849
What's this about, Kate?

216
00:15:52,933 --> 00:15:55,128
I don't know.

217
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:01,643
Marie's in her room adjusting her dress.

218
00:16:01,733 --> 00:16:04,406
Just make sure
she doesn't find out about this.

219
00:16:04,493 --> 00:16:05,972
Sure.

220
00:16:15,213 --> 00:16:17,283
- Reza Naiyeer?
- Yes.

221
00:16:17,373 --> 00:16:19,841
I'm Agent Richards. Right this way.

222
00:16:24,773 --> 00:16:26,764
Oh! What is that?

223
00:16:26,853 --> 00:16:29,765
- Some lunch for you.
- Can you put it there?

224
00:16:36,013 --> 00:16:40,928
I want you to know that since your
conversation with the prime minister,

225
00:16:41,013 --> 00:16:46,804
we have taken four suspected members
of Second Wave into custody,

226
00:16:46,893 --> 00:16:49,487
and we have begun interrogations.

227
00:16:49,573 --> 00:16:53,486
- What have you learned?
- We are still questioning them.

228
00:16:53,573 --> 00:16:56,804
As a ranking security officer, I assure you,

229
00:16:56,893 --> 00:16:59,965
we are doing all we can
to clamp down on this kind of activity.

230
00:17:00,053 --> 00:17:05,047
These satellite photos
were taken over your country an hour ago.

231
00:17:11,253 --> 00:17:14,131
Doesn't look like
too much of a clampdown to me.

232
00:17:16,613 --> 00:17:20,765
We don't have the resources that you do,
and surely even you can't tell me

233
00:17:20,853 --> 00:17:26,132
that you are aware of every single
active paramilitary compound in the US.

234
00:17:28,613 --> 00:17:31,730
If this bomb goes off, Mr President,

235
00:17:31,813 --> 00:17:35,886
and you don't believe that
we did everything possible to stop it,

236
00:17:35,973 --> 00:17:39,602
there will be heavy repercussions
for my country.

237
00:17:39,693 --> 00:17:45,370
You have already made it clear that you will
have no choice but to retaliate against us.

238
00:17:47,213 --> 00:17:48,851
We want to help.

239
00:17:52,213 --> 00:17:57,048
- What do you propose?
- A mutual exchange of intelligence.

240
00:18:00,373 --> 00:18:03,012
- What kind of exchange?
- We need access

241
00:18:03,093 --> 00:18:06,369
- to your files on Second Wave.
- Our files?

242
00:18:06,453 --> 00:18:10,844
Yes. Anything that pertains to
suspected terrorism in our country.

243
00:18:10,933 --> 00:18:15,165
I'm not sure how much intel it's in our
interest to share with you at this time.

244
00:18:15,253 --> 00:18:18,051
I understand your reservations, Mr President.

245
00:18:18,693 --> 00:18:24,006
But be assured,
we want to prevent this... incident.

246
00:18:24,733 --> 00:18:28,282
We are prepared
for an exchange in both directions.

247
00:18:28,373 --> 00:18:31,843
We are willing to
open up our files to you as well.

248
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:38,406
- I'll have to think about this, Mr Ambassador.
- Of course.

249
00:18:38,493 --> 00:18:41,405
We prepared a room for you.
You'll have our answer shortly.

250
00:18:41,493 --> 00:18:43,085
Thank you, Mr President.

251
00:18:43,173 --> 00:18:45,368
- Mr Ambassador.
- Mr Stanton.

252
00:18:51,413 --> 00:18:53,688
Right this way, sir.

253
00:18:56,093 --> 00:19:00,564
- We can't give them this information, sir.
- Explain. What's the downside?

254
00:19:00,653 --> 00:19:04,123
We have agents in their country, right now.

255
00:19:04,213 --> 00:19:07,808
- Those files would expose their identities.
- Fine.

256
00:19:07,893 --> 00:19:11,852
Go through the files, take out anything
that would jeopardise our people.

257
00:19:11,933 --> 00:19:16,211
- It's a dangerous precedent.
- We can't worry about precedent, not today.

258
00:19:16,293 --> 00:19:19,091
Not under the threat of nuclear attack.

259
00:19:22,733 --> 00:19:26,931
I guess my point is...
I don't trust the ambassador.

260
00:19:30,453 --> 00:19:35,652
And we can't ignore the possibility that
his country is supporting Second Wave.

261
00:19:38,133 --> 00:19:40,488
Lynne, what do you think?

262
00:19:44,213 --> 00:19:47,125
I agree with Roger. I think it's too risky.

263
00:20:00,213 --> 00:20:02,124
- Yeah.
- Dad, it's me.

264
00:20:02,213 --> 00:20:05,205
- Kim, are you all right?
- I'm OK. What about you?

265
00:20:05,293 --> 00:20:08,330
- Were you at CTU when the bomb went off?
- No, honey, I'm fine.

266
00:20:08,413 --> 00:20:11,211
- Are you on your way to Aunt Carol's?
- I haven't left yet.

267
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:14,205
- What is going on? You sounded weird.
- It doesn't matter.

268
00:20:14,293 --> 00:20:17,365
- Go to Aunt Carol's.
- I can't. That's why I'm calling.

269
00:20:17,453 --> 00:20:19,523
- Why? What's wrong?
- It's Megan.

270
00:20:19,613 --> 00:20:22,571
Her dad freaked out and hit her.
I'm at the hospital.

271
00:20:22,653 --> 00:20:27,010
Sweetheart, you're gonna have to let that go.
It's not safe in Los Angeles today.

272
00:20:27,093 --> 00:20:29,084
Why not?

273
00:20:29,173 --> 00:20:31,641
Something bad's gonna happen.
Just trust me.

274
00:20:31,733 --> 00:20:33,007
Dad, tell me.

275
00:20:37,133 --> 00:20:41,843
Sweetheart, there's a nuclear bomb
in Los Angeles. It might go off today.

276
00:20:43,453 --> 00:20:45,444
Oh my God.

277
00:20:46,373 --> 00:20:48,329
All right. I'll leave, but I...

278
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,847
No buts, Kim. Go. Now.

279
00:20:51,773 --> 00:20:53,809
Are you gonna meet me at Aunt Carol's?

280
00:20:53,893 --> 00:20:56,407
As soon as I'm finished here at CTU. OK?

281
00:20:56,493 --> 00:20:58,688
- All right.
- Kim?

282
00:20:59,493 --> 00:21:02,929
Don't tell anybody about this, OK?
We can't start a panic.

283
00:21:03,013 --> 00:21:03,968
OK.

284
00:21:04,413 --> 00:21:06,688
- Call me as soon as you get there.
- OK.

285
00:21:06,773 --> 00:21:08,968
Dad, I love you.

286
00:21:11,533 --> 00:21:13,728
I love you too, sweetheart.

287
00:21:14,893 --> 00:21:17,327
- Now go.
- OK.

288
00:21:41,173 --> 00:21:43,846
George wondered if there
was anything I can do to help.

289
00:21:43,933 --> 00:21:46,242
No, thank you.

290
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:48,688
I could fill out that boilerplate stuff for you.

291
00:21:48,773 --> 00:21:51,003
Michelle, I know George wants me outta here.

292
00:21:51,093 --> 00:21:54,369
Take my advice.
Don't get caught in the middle.

293
00:23:14,853 --> 00:23:17,048
Hello, Nina.

294
00:23:31,773 --> 00:23:34,810
So you weren't just working for the Drazens.

295
00:23:34,893 --> 00:23:37,726
Selling information to anybody who'd buy it.

296
00:23:37,813 --> 00:23:41,601
Presidential assassins,
terrorists, didn't matter.

297
00:23:45,653 --> 00:23:48,451
What do you know about this nuclear bomb?

298
00:23:51,893 --> 00:23:55,488
Here are the terms, George.
They're nonnegotiable.

299
00:23:57,293 --> 00:24:02,765
I'll give up my contacts,
my background material, all my intel.

300
00:24:02,853 --> 00:24:06,050
I'll work with whoever you want,
here or in the field.

301
00:24:06,133 --> 00:24:08,408
For that, I want a full presidential pardon,

302
00:24:08,493 --> 00:24:11,610
third party certification,
guaranteed in writing.

303
00:24:11,693 --> 00:24:14,161
It's not gonna fly.

304
00:24:14,253 --> 00:24:16,448
Then take me back.

305
00:24:17,773 --> 00:24:20,082
You're not buying a used car here.

306
00:24:20,733 --> 00:24:23,884
You have to deal
within the confines of reality.

307
00:24:23,973 --> 00:24:27,170
You're not gonna get anything
unless you produce results.

308
00:24:27,253 --> 00:24:30,563
It's in my interest to produce results.

309
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:58,486
Is this working? Then put me through
to Chappelle at Division.

310
00:25:00,213 --> 00:25:02,443
Is she gonna help?

311
00:25:02,533 --> 00:25:04,922
Finish your debrief, and go.

312
00:25:05,973 --> 00:25:08,362
Ryan, it's me.

313
00:25:08,453 --> 00:25:10,250
Excuse me.

314
00:25:11,253 --> 00:25:13,448
Sorry about that.

315
00:25:18,773 --> 00:25:21,241
So, as chief financial officer,

316
00:25:21,333 --> 00:25:24,882
you oversee all the money that comes
in and out of the company, right?

317
00:25:24,973 --> 00:25:27,885
Right. And in case you hadn't noticed,

318
00:25:27,973 --> 00:25:32,012
I'm getting married today, so if we could
do this another time I'd appreciate it.

319
00:25:32,093 --> 00:25:36,006
Could you sit down, please?
We're not done. Sit down.

320
00:25:41,093 --> 00:25:43,288
Sit down.

321
00:25:50,013 --> 00:25:54,803
- Why don’t you tell me about Syed Ali?
- I told you before, I do not know a Syed Ali.

322
00:25:54,893 --> 00:25:56,884
You don't?

323
00:25:56,973 --> 00:26:03,048
Then how do you explain the fact that
his name is in your personal computer files?

324
00:26:14,933 --> 00:26:16,844
I don't know.

325
00:26:17,853 --> 00:26:19,844
You don't know.

326
00:26:21,533 --> 00:26:22,727
All right.

327
00:26:25,373 --> 00:26:28,092
Why don't we start again?

328
00:26:34,093 --> 00:26:38,052
- Where's Marie?
- Still in her room, working on the dress.

329
00:26:39,053 --> 00:26:44,081
- How much longer is he gonna be with Reza?
- Sorry, sir, I don't know.

330
00:26:44,173 --> 00:26:48,485
Dad, she's gonna find out
the second she walks out of the room.

331
00:26:48,573 --> 00:26:51,212
Are we gonna be able
to go through with this?

332
00:26:51,293 --> 00:26:53,853
- What do you mean?
- The wedding.

333
00:26:54,853 --> 00:26:59,244
- Dad, it's in less than six hours.
- No one's cancelling anything.

334
00:27:00,253 --> 00:27:04,929
Just... make sure Marie
stays away from these people, OK?

335
00:27:07,413 --> 00:27:10,530
Roger, I want you to monitor
how they use our intel.

336
00:27:11,973 --> 00:27:13,929
I'm not comfortable with this.

337
00:27:15,293 --> 00:27:20,287
- We've flagged the restricted topics, so...
- It should be a one-way dialogue.

338
00:27:22,013 --> 00:27:25,562
Mr President, it's Ryan Chappelle,
Division Los Angeles.

339
00:27:26,573 --> 00:27:30,407
- Yes, Ryan.
- I have an update on Nina Myers.

340
00:27:30,493 --> 00:27:32,688
She's demanding a full presidential pardon.

341
00:27:40,093 --> 00:27:42,368
Here's my debrief. It's finished.

342
00:27:42,453 --> 00:27:43,522
Thanks.

343
00:27:59,613 --> 00:28:02,002
I am supposed to get you outta here.

344
00:28:02,613 --> 00:28:05,002
That's not gonna happen, is it?

345
00:28:08,653 --> 00:28:11,451
It's the first time I've seen her since...

346
00:28:16,133 --> 00:28:21,765
Why are you doing this to yourself, Jack?
Mason's right. You should get out of here.

347
00:28:27,293 --> 00:28:29,853
- Michelle Dessler.
- Is Jack Bauer there?

348
00:28:29,933 --> 00:28:31,924
Hold on. Jack.

349
00:28:35,613 --> 00:28:38,173
Jack. It's for you.

350
00:28:41,373 --> 00:28:43,045
- Yeah?
- Jack Bauer?

351
00:28:43,133 --> 00:28:46,330
- Yes.
- Hold one moment for the president.

352
00:28:48,533 --> 00:28:50,683
- Jack?
- Mr President.

353
00:28:50,773 --> 00:28:53,970
I want to thank you
for your good work this morning.

354
00:28:54,053 --> 00:28:55,771
Yes, sir.

355
00:28:56,773 --> 00:29:00,607
There's something else,
and I want you to hear it from me personally.

356
00:29:00,693 --> 00:29:02,684
About Nina Myers.

357
00:29:05,613 --> 00:29:08,332
I'm gonna have to grant her
a shadow asylum.

358
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:14,767
That sounds like a pardon, sir.

359
00:29:15,773 --> 00:29:16,922
It is.

360
00:29:17,773 --> 00:29:20,890
But only a couple of people
will ever know about it.

361
00:29:21,693 --> 00:29:24,526
She'll be deported to another country.

362
00:29:26,373 --> 00:29:29,763
Jack, I know how difficult
this must be for you to hear.

363
00:29:29,853 --> 00:29:31,491
It was a painful decision.

364
00:29:31,573 --> 00:29:36,124
But as you know, she has information
that can help us find this bomb.

365
00:29:38,933 --> 00:29:41,322
I wish there was another way.

366
00:29:42,733 --> 00:29:44,371
So do l, sir.

367
00:29:45,973 --> 00:29:50,649
Let's just get through this day.
Eventually we'll make it right.

368
00:29:51,693 --> 00:29:53,968
Yes, sir.

369
00:29:54,053 --> 00:29:55,771
Thank you, Jack.

370
00:30:03,973 --> 00:30:06,168
What is it?

371
00:30:17,733 --> 00:30:20,452
You're gonna let her go.

372
00:30:41,853 --> 00:30:43,969
- Hello?
- I've been trying to reach you.

373
00:30:44,053 --> 00:30:46,567
I had my cell off. We're recording.

374
00:30:46,653 --> 00:30:49,725
- I need you.
- I really need you, too.

375
00:30:49,813 --> 00:30:53,203
- Quit it, Miguel. I'm in trouble.
- What happened? Are you OK?

376
00:30:53,293 --> 00:30:56,410
No, no, no. It's not me, it's Megan.
You have to come help me.

377
00:30:56,493 --> 00:30:58,165
Help you do what? What's goin' on?

378
00:30:58,253 --> 00:31:03,532
I can't explain it over the phone.
Just get over here, please. I really need you.

379
00:31:03,933 --> 00:31:06,686
Kim, I have a whole studio full of people here.

380
00:31:06,773 --> 00:31:12,484
You just have to trust me. I wouldn't
ask if it wasn't important. Miguel?

381
00:31:13,173 --> 00:31:15,164
OK. Where are you?

382
00:31:45,493 --> 00:31:49,611
President Palmer told me
he had to take a deal with Nina.

383
00:31:49,693 --> 00:31:52,207
I want the case. I know how she thinks.

384
00:31:52,293 --> 00:31:55,171
- Really?
- Yes, and you know it.

385
00:31:56,613 --> 00:32:01,926
I'm not talking to you, Jack.
Because you're not here right now.

386
00:32:11,853 --> 00:32:14,447
- Good. Set up here, have it ready to go.
- OK.

387
00:32:14,533 --> 00:32:17,093
- Did you find it yet?
- There's no plus-five here.

388
00:32:17,173 --> 00:32:19,562
Try the DC lines in the phone circuits.

389
00:32:20,613 --> 00:32:24,322
Great, great. Skip the virus cycle.
Just get these all online.

390
00:32:26,733 --> 00:32:30,806
I need Mason's log-in sheets.
I need to know everywhere he's been.

391
00:32:30,893 --> 00:32:33,726
- You're not cleared for that.
- Then clear me for it.

392
00:32:33,813 --> 00:32:37,442
- I'm right in the middle of this thing.
- What does it have to do with George?

393
00:32:37,533 --> 00:32:39,967
I need to make sure he's fit to run CTU.

394
00:32:40,373 --> 00:32:42,841
- Fit?
- I think something's happened to him.

395
00:32:43,533 --> 00:32:48,561
Believe it or not, I used to run this place.
I know what I'm doing. I wanna help him.

396
00:32:48,653 --> 00:32:51,645
Please. Get me those log-in sheets.

397
00:32:58,093 --> 00:33:01,210
- Can you let me know when it's done, Cori?
- I will.

398
00:33:01,293 --> 00:33:03,284
- Hi, Cori.
- Hi.

399
00:33:04,453 --> 00:33:07,365
I'm starved, but I don't want to eat anything.

400
00:33:07,453 --> 00:33:12,368
- Why not?
- Because the dress fits perfectly right now.

401
00:33:12,453 --> 00:33:14,250
- Marie...
- Yeah?

402
00:33:15,253 --> 00:33:18,643
- There's been a problem.
- Of course there has. It's a wedding.

403
00:33:18,733 --> 00:33:21,486
- It's about Reza.
- Oh. Is he backing out?

404
00:33:23,573 --> 00:33:25,962
What's going on?

405
00:33:26,053 --> 00:33:27,691
Where's Reza?

406
00:33:27,773 --> 00:33:29,809
He's in the dining room.

407
00:33:31,573 --> 00:33:32,801
Marie?

408
00:33:35,493 --> 00:33:39,452
- Who are you?
- I'm Agent Richards, CTU Los Angeles.

409
00:33:39,533 --> 00:33:44,926
- Reza's in the room talking to another agent.
- What for? What does he want with Reza?

410
00:33:47,213 --> 00:33:49,602
- Dad?
- Marie, um...

411
00:33:50,213 --> 00:33:53,171
- I wanna see Reza.
- Sorry, ma'am. I can't let you in.

412
00:33:53,253 --> 00:33:56,086
This is our house!
I want you out of here, now!

413
00:34:00,453 --> 00:34:03,490
- Kate, do you know what's going on?
- Marie, come with me.

414
00:34:03,573 --> 00:34:05,211
- Why?
- Please.

415
00:34:11,333 --> 00:34:14,086
This whole thing started with me.

416
00:34:14,613 --> 00:34:16,569
Please try and understand.

417
00:34:16,653 --> 00:34:19,611
I saw something in the company books
that didn't check out,

418
00:34:19,693 --> 00:34:22,651
so I hired a private investigator
to check up on Reza.

419
00:34:22,733 --> 00:34:25,327
- You what?!
- He came across the name

420
00:34:25,413 --> 00:34:27,688
of a man Reza's had dealings with.

421
00:34:27,773 --> 00:34:30,412
A man involved in terrorist activities.

422
00:34:30,493 --> 00:34:33,530
- What?!
- I did it for you, Marie.

423
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:36,207
- To protect you.
- Protect me?

424
00:34:37,053 --> 00:34:42,207
All this time, you've been
checking up on Reza behind our backs?

425
00:34:42,293 --> 00:34:46,081
These people found out
something about Reza, about his past.

426
00:34:46,173 --> 00:34:49,245
If he's keeping something from you,
wouldn’t you rather know?

427
00:34:49,333 --> 00:34:54,123
What business is it of yours? This is my life.
How dare you interfere with it like this!

428
00:34:54,213 --> 00:34:56,522
It's my wedding day!

429
00:34:56,613 --> 00:35:01,004
Hiring a private investigator?
That's insane, Kate. Insane.

430
00:35:01,093 --> 00:35:03,288
Marie, just calm down, OK?

431
00:35:03,373 --> 00:35:07,605
These men are gonna be
outta here in a few minutes. All right?

432
00:35:07,693 --> 00:35:10,890
It's just a big misunderstanding. OK?

433
00:35:10,973 --> 00:35:13,806
Let's try to remember that we're a family.

434
00:35:15,693 --> 00:35:18,366
Not any more.
I don't want you at the wedding.

435
00:35:18,453 --> 00:35:21,331
It is unacceptable
that she did this without telling me.

436
00:35:21,413 --> 00:35:23,244
Marie, I'm sorry.

437
00:35:24,253 --> 00:35:26,642
It was wrong of me not to tell you first.

438
00:35:30,653 --> 00:35:33,042
Apology accepted.

439
00:35:35,773 --> 00:35:38,333
- Now get out of here.
- No.

440
00:35:38,413 --> 00:35:39,812
Marie.

441
00:35:59,013 --> 00:36:01,163
Thank you very much.

442
00:36:04,773 --> 00:36:08,322
- Miguel, where's the car?
- I let Rob take it. Why?

443
00:36:08,413 --> 00:36:10,768
- We need it.
- We'll take a cab.

444
00:36:10,853 --> 00:36:13,287
We can't.

445
00:36:13,373 --> 00:36:15,807
Kim, what's goin' on?

446
00:36:15,893 --> 00:36:18,805
- We need to get Megan out of here.
- What happened?

447
00:36:18,893 --> 00:36:21,407
Gary threw her to the ground.
She hit her head.

448
00:36:21,493 --> 00:36:24,405
The doctors think
there's evidence of other things, too.

449
00:36:24,493 --> 00:36:26,768
- Did you talk to the police?
- I can't.

450
00:36:26,853 --> 00:36:29,925
He threatened to arrest me
for kidnapping if I said anything.

451
00:36:30,013 --> 00:36:34,291
- Kidnapping?
- I took her out of the house. I had to.

452
00:36:35,293 --> 00:36:39,172
She's safe as long as she's here
at the hospital. You need to talk to Carla.

453
00:36:39,253 --> 00:36:42,450
- It's too late for that.
- What do you mean?

454
00:36:44,813 --> 00:36:48,806
You know that building that blew up today?
My father used to work there.

455
00:36:48,893 --> 00:36:52,169
They go after terrorists.
I talked to him a half-hour ago.

456
00:36:52,253 --> 00:36:55,723
He seems to think that we need to
get out of LA as soon as possible.

457
00:36:55,813 --> 00:36:57,132
Why?

458
00:36:59,093 --> 00:37:01,243
Come here.

459
00:37:03,373 --> 00:37:06,365
He said there was a nuclear bomb in the city.

460
00:37:07,373 --> 00:37:10,285
- And he thinks it's gonna go off today.
- Whoa!

461
00:37:11,293 --> 00:37:12,692
I know.

462
00:37:14,613 --> 00:37:17,047
- You believe him?
- Yeah, I believe him.

463
00:37:21,053 --> 00:37:24,966
- Then let's get outta here.
- No, we can't. Not without Megan.

464
00:37:43,453 --> 00:37:45,842
What are you doing in my office?

465
00:37:45,933 --> 00:37:48,128
How long did they give you?

466
00:37:48,493 --> 00:37:53,487
I know you were exposed to high levels of
radioactive materials in Panorama City today.

467
00:37:55,133 --> 00:37:58,364
- How'd you figure that out?
- Your anti-nausea medication.

468
00:37:58,453 --> 00:38:00,921
It's for radiation sickness.

469
00:38:01,013 --> 00:38:04,130
I checked the logs, I made a few calls.

470
00:38:04,213 --> 00:38:07,330
- You inhaled plutonium, George.
- So?

471
00:38:07,413 --> 00:38:11,201
So I'm not the only person
who shouldn't be here today.

472
00:38:21,493 --> 00:38:23,802
How long do you have?

473
00:38:24,813 --> 00:38:28,089
I'll probably be dead by this time tomorrow.

474
00:38:28,173 --> 00:38:30,482
Why? What's it to you?

475
00:38:31,693 --> 00:38:34,491
I wanna know what your plans are for Nina.

476
00:38:36,253 --> 00:38:39,325
Soon as we get a signature from Palmer
she'll tell us everything.

477
00:38:39,413 --> 00:38:41,847
- Who's gonna be the handler?
- O'Neil.

478
00:38:41,933 --> 00:38:44,322
Forget about O'Neil. I wanna do it.

479
00:38:45,413 --> 00:38:49,486
I'm dying, Jack. I'm not crazy. You
and Nina together is a recipe for disaster.

480
00:38:49,573 --> 00:38:54,772
If you don't do this, I'll tell District about your
condition. You'll be replaced within minutes.

481
00:38:54,853 --> 00:38:58,846
George, we want the same thing.
We want to finish this job and find the bomb.

482
00:38:58,933 --> 00:39:01,128
Let me do it.

483
00:39:03,253 --> 00:39:05,448
Go ahead.

484
00:39:15,373 --> 00:39:17,568
I'm sorry.

485
00:39:21,373 --> 00:39:23,603
The ambassador's chopper just took off.

486
00:39:23,693 --> 00:39:28,323
As soon as he gets on his plane, he and
Salim will conference with the prime minister.

487
00:39:28,413 --> 00:39:30,881
How soon can we expect
the intelligence reports?

488
00:39:30,973 --> 00:39:34,807
Within the hour. And then there'll be
updates every 30 minutes after that.

489
00:39:34,893 --> 00:39:38,249
OK. You'd better set up a call
with the Joint Chiefs.

490
00:39:38,333 --> 00:39:42,451
I have a feeling they're not gonna be happy
about the information exchange.

491
00:39:42,533 --> 00:39:44,330
Right away, sir.

492
00:39:45,333 --> 00:39:49,406
Mr President, take a look at this.
Internal feed from Fox News.

493
00:39:50,573 --> 00:39:53,883
The press conference was scheduled for...

494
00:39:53,973 --> 00:39:55,565
What was that?

495
00:39:55,653 --> 00:39:57,723
Pull up. Did you see that?

496
00:39:58,133 --> 00:40:01,523
- Just moments ago...
- Where is this, Los Angeles?

497
00:40:01,613 --> 00:40:04,685
- No, sir. It's right here.
- ...broke up in midair...

498
00:40:05,493 --> 00:40:09,611
- I don't understand.
- It's the ambassador's chopper.

499
00:40:10,213 --> 00:40:16,243
- It crashed just after takeoff.
- ...smoke billowing from the area behind me.

500
00:40:16,333 --> 00:40:19,962
I have no information at this time as to
who may have been on the helicopter...

501
00:40:20,053 --> 00:40:23,523
First indications are there are no survivors.

502
00:40:24,933 --> 00:40:26,366
...seemed to explode.

503
00:40:26,453 --> 00:40:29,251
Again, all I know is at the time,

504
00:40:29,333 --> 00:40:33,531
the helicopter,
apparently a military helicopter...

505
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:44,729
Stop treating me like a criminal!

506
00:40:51,693 --> 00:40:55,686
The surveillance is all hooked up
in the interrogation room, Michelle.

507
00:40:55,773 --> 00:40:58,606
- I'm gonna have to get back to you.
- All right.

508
00:42:15,413 --> 00:42:18,166
