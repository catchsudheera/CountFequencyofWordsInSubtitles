1
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:18,238
You've already been briefed on the Cordilla
virus that is now threatening our cities.

2
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:22,069
A vial of that virus has been released.
We have the identity of the perpetrator.

3
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,033
His name is Stephen Saunders
and he's a former Ml6 agent.

4
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:30,632
In 32 countries your government employs
intelligence consultants. They're spies.

5
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:33,479
In 45 minutes I want a list of their identities.

6
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,230
<i>If you fail to comply, I will release
two vials of the virus in major cities.</i>

7
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:41,238
<i>- Looks like Saunders has a daughter.
-  A daughter?</i>

8
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,357
<i> She's 19,
goes to school in Santa Barbara.</i>

9
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,789
<i>I was just about to have her picked up.</i>

10
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:51,556
Tony, that's not the right play. If you wanna
grab her, do it without him knowing.

11
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,309
Which means we have to switch her out
with one of our own agents.

12
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,756
OK, let's see her.

13
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,791
You're not gonna fool anyone
who knows Jane up close.

14
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,029
I know.

15
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,871
Clear.

16
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,156
You think I'm playing a game?

17
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,669
Hundreds of thousands of lives
are on the line.

18
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:21,475
You have no idea how far I'm willing to go
to acquire your cooperation.

19
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,471
<i>- Where is your father?
- I don't know!</i>

20
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,717
- Could you help me find something?
- Yeah.

21
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,592
Call for help and I'll kill you.

22
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,995
Kim? Dammit!

23
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,517
Saunders is gonna know
we have his daughter.

24
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,713
These quarantine zones
were set up an hour ago.

25
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:54,276
Since then two new patients
were discovered at an ER in Silver Lake

26
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,277
and one at Hancock Park.

27
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,392
Those two cases engendered
five new quarantine areas.

28
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,431
That's three per cent of the city.

29
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,877
If containment isn't total,
it'll grow exponentially.

30
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,759
All right. Thanks, Adam.

31
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,314
We're all tired. I know that.

32
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,273
And some of you have been working
for 24 hours straight.

33
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,312
So I don't have to tell you
how serious this situation is.

34
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,432
But we can't drift.

35
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,155
If there ever was a worse-case scenario,
this is it. We're in it.

36
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,871
Everyone has to stay on point.

37
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,835
We've switched from prevention
to containment. The virus is out.

38
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,149
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

39
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,234
I'm sorry it had to go down like this.

40
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,352
The man I shot, is he dead?

41
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,436
Yeah.

42
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,558
What's gonna happen now?
Saunders is gonna know we got Jane.

43
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,831
- This is Jack.
- The Saunders girl's calmed down.

44
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:15,634
- You can try talking to her again.
- Thanks, Rachel.

45
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,593
We'll see what we can get from the daughter.

46
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,878
<i>- I understand.
- You'll tell him?</i>

47
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,191
I'll tell him.

48
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:33,759
<i>- I want every precaution taken.
- I'll get back to you.</i>

49
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:40,237
- What's going on with Jack Bauer?
- The operation wasn't completely successful.

50
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,318
They have Saunders' daughter
but didn't remain covert.

51
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,510
- So Saunders knows we have her?
- Not yet.

52
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,632
But CTU is estimating
he'll find out within the hour.

53
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,399
- What's Jack's plan?
- Use Saunders' daughter.

54
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,795
Try to locate him.

55
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:58,635
David, listen, the deadline for his next
demand is gonna be up in about 15 minutes.

56
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:02,833
Giving this guy a list of every foreign
operative on our payroll's an act of treason.

57
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:07,795
I know that, but he'll release
more of the virus if we don't.

58
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,474
So what do you wanna do?

59
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,874
I wanna see what Bauer
gets out of the daughter first.

60
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,231
You know what just happened?

61
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,840
A man who your father hired to protect you
just tried to kill one of my agents.

62
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:38,476
So you killed him, right?
A man that worked for my father.

63
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,558
You're a smart girl, Jane.
Look out at that room.

64
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:47,630
Everyone here is a federal agent whose job
it is to protect the lives of American citizens.

65
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,870
I know how hard it must be
to believe everything

66
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,793
that everybody's been telling you
about your father.

67
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,845
But I'm gonna show you some things
that'll change your mind.

68
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:00,880
The sooner you stop resisting me,
the sooner you can help us start saving lives.

69
00:05:00,915 --> 00:05:03,553
Why are you putting all this on me?

70
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06,313
Because you're Stephen Saunders' daughter,

71
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,845
and, unfortunately,
you're the only leverage we have against him.

72
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:14,317
You can't just say these outrageous things
and expect me to believe you.

73
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,271
I know.

74
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:19,752
Truth is, I knew your father.

75
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,871
I worked with him.

76
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,629
He was a good man. He was a brave man.

77
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,035
But something's happened to him.

78
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,517
All I care about now is stopping him
from doing what he's doing.

79
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:36,871
I can't do that without you. I need your help.

80
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,632
- Palmer still hasn't sent the list yet.
- He has 15 more minutes.

81
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:51,675
CTU is trying to use IP locators
to get at you through the domain name.

82
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,872
- We're protected, though, right?
- Yes, it's a dead end.

83
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,876
Good.

84
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,871
<i> Thank you.</i>

85
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,429
I'm gonna show you who your father really is.

86
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,758
These photographs were taken
over eight years ago.

87
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,845
Your father said he was going
on a fact-finding mission,

88
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:23,671
but we were both part of a unit dispatched
to Kosovo to kill a man named Victor Drazen.

89
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,833
This was where the mission ended,
Drazen's hide-out.

90
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,838
When I left, I believed
your father had died in the blast.

91
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,678
The government told your mother
that's where he died.

92
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:39,353
But recently we discovered that your father
contacted you four years ago. Is that right?

93
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,845
Yes.

94
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:45,873
A couple of months after my mother died,
I got a call from him.

95
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,880
He said he was living under an assumed
name and that nobody knew he was alive.

96
00:06:52,915 --> 00:06:57,635
And, for his protection, I couldn't
tell anyone that I had spoken to him.

97
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:01,116
Did he ever tell you why he had
contacted you after so many years?

98
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,396
Yes.

99
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,155
He missed me.

100
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:11,597
I understand that.

101
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:15,713
Over the last three to four hours
we've been pulling data from Interpol.

102
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,845
Here are some more recent images.

103
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:22,880
This is your father with Sayid Kolobe,
a known weapons dealer in the Middle East.

104
00:07:22,915 --> 00:07:26,873
Here he's with a biologist who's now
spending the rest of his life in prison

105
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,475
for the manufacturing
of illegal biological weapons.

106
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,831
He could have been meeting with them
for any number of reasons.

107
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:38,874
I'll play you an audio file, one of three
that we got from your father earlier today.

108
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,115
This is your father talking to the president.

109
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,558
<i>... working against those countries at the
behest of the American military machine.</i>

110
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,913
<i>In 45 minutes I want a list of their identities
sent to me by way of a website:</i>

111
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,845
<i>sylviaimports.com.</i>

112
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:58,908
<i>If you fail to comply, I will release
two vials of the virus in major cities.</i>

113
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,230
Two more vials.
He's already released one.

114
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,796
This is a live feed from
the Chandler Plaza Hotel in Los Angeles

115
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:09,192
where your father ordered the release
of the virus into the ventilation system.

116
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,193
These people will all be dead
within two to three hours.

117
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,239
Almost 800 of them are infected, Jane.

118
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,915
This is how they'll die.

119
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,673
- I don't wanna see any more.
- I don't wanna see any more, either.

120
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,997
You can help us stop this, Jane, please.

121
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,836
Please.

122
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,878
I have a phone number.

123
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,117
He told me to call it, day or night,
if I ever got in trouble.

124
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,754
Have you ever used it before?

125
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,869
No.

126
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,791
We need it.

127
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,232
No! No!

128
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,199
It's a mistake! I'm OK!

129
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,880
I don't have any infection!

130
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,154
No!

131
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:18,115
Don't take me in there with those people!
I don't wanna die!

132
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,793
I don't wanna die!

133
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:02,238
Michelle, I just got a call.
Your lab results are on the way here.

134
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,952
I'm sorry to interrupt, Mr President.

135
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,677
What is this, Aaron?

136
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:40,430
Our bureau chief just informed me that
NHS believes Los Angeles is no longer safe.

137
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,996
We would like to move you out of the state.

138
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,395
I appreciate your concern.

139
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,951
Tell Chief Kurtzman
I'd rather manage matters from here.

140
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:53,356
Sir, I'm afraid this isn't a request.

141
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:58,273
- Excuse me?
- Secret Service is invoking Section 32.

142
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:04,839
For your own protection, we are requiring you
to accompany us to Air Force One.

143
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,830
- You're ordering me?
- Yes, sir.

144
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,872
- It's for your safety.
- Wayne.

145
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:14,873
I don't know the specifics of the code,
but Secret Service is invoking it.

146
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,428
And, David, here in LA the threat is serious.

147
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,753
It's serious everywhere.
At least here we know what we're facing.

148
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:26,277
- Who has to sign off on this?
- Chief Kurtzman and myself.

149
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,190
I'd like a word in private with you, Aaron.

150
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,357
Sir, I'm sorry for appearing
to overstep my bounds.

151
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,869
It's my job to protect you.

152
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,037
Listen, Aaron, you've been with me
from the beginning.

153
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:00,869
You don't have to apologize
for doing your job.

154
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,076
But this crisis will end,

155
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,159
and the people in this city
and this country will be stronger

156
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:12,877
knowing that their president
stood by them shoulder to shoulder.

157
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,357
I'm asking you as a friend and a fellow citizen,

158
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:22,156
protect me, but here in Los Angeles.

159
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,555
Can you do that for me?

160
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,917
Yes, sir. For you, I can.

161
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,237
- Thank you.
- Yes, sir.

162
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,557
<i>Mr President,
the conference call is about to begin.</i>

163
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,880
<i>-  Jack, you there?
- Yeah, I'm on.</i>

164
00:13:04,915 --> 00:13:07,440
- Mr President?
- Mr Almeida.

165
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:11,269
I understand we may have a way
to locate this man, Stephen Saunders.

166
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:15,552
Yes, sir. However, my technical staff
just informed me that to do so properly

167
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,394
may take 15 minutes, possibly longer.

168
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,273
There's no way to get to him
in the next few minutes?

169
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,874
No, sir, there's not.

170
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,845
OK, gentlemen, the time is upon us.

171
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:34,352
Having considered all the scenarios, I see no
other choice than to draw our line in the sand.

172
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,845
I will not give in to Saunders' latest demand.

173
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,845
Mr President, that leaves us
with only one option,

174
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:45,880
to use his daughter as a hostage
and hope that that'll stop him.

175
00:13:45,915 --> 00:13:48,440
I understand.

176
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,872
<i>- All right, gentlemen. Get to it.
- Yes, sir.</i>

177
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,436
David, are you sure
we're doing the right thing?

178
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:03,159
The only thing I'm sure of is we cannot let
this country be taken over by this madman.

179
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:07,358
- Jack, how do you wanna do this?
- How long do we need to run a trace?

180
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,995
- About a minute.
- We need to cover our bases.

181
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,192
We'll use Jane to try and keep him on the line.

182
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,039
I'll initiate the trace.
You tell Jane what we need.

183
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,878
I'll get back to you.

184
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,956
Dammit.

185
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,590
- What's happening?
- We've run out of time.

186
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,110
We need you to call your father.

187
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:32,516
- And tell him what?
- Anything. Just keep him on the line.

188
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,871
- For how long?
- At least a minute.

189
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,912
- Do you think you can do that?
- I need to think about it.

190
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,076
We don't have any more time.

191
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:47,713
Your father just threatened to release
more of the virus in the next few minutes.

192
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,995
- Is the list up yet?
- No.

193
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,120
Well, his time is up.

194
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,511
<i>- Yeah.
- It's me.</i>

195
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:05,029
<i>- Yes, Stephen.
- Release San Francisco.</i>

196
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:08,152
<i>I understand.</i>

197
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:11,113
That's my daughter's line. Lan, wait.

198
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,391
<i>- I'll call you right back.
- All right.</i>

199
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,117
Find out where this is coming from.

200
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,676
- Jane?
- Yeah.

201
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,879
Hi, Dad.

202
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,879
<i>What's wrong? I told you only to use
this number in an emergency.</i>

203
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,356
I wanna see you. I'm scared.

204
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:41,036
The airports are shut down and they're talking
about the alert level being raised.

205
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,078
Just stay where you are, honey. You'll be fine.

206
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:49,435
- Someone is monitoring the call.
- Hang on a second, honey.

207
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,234
- Are you sure?
- Yes. The signal's splitting.

208
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,232
They've got her.

209
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,511
We just got hit on the trace route.
He knows we're on the phone.

210
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:04,155
- What do I do?
- You're doing great. Just keep talking.

211
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,995
- Jane.
- Yes, Dad.

212
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:15,999
There's a man named Jack Bauer
with you, isn't there?

213
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:19,795
- What, Dad?
- Hand the phone to him.

214
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,480
- Dad...
- You heard me.

215
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,637
- I'm on the line, Stephen.
- Jack.

216
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:35,753
You know how many vials I have
and what I'm capable of.

217
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:46,597
You know what I'm capable of, too.

218
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:53,238
- Did you get a lock on the signal?
- Negative.

219
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,113
- Tony, did you get him?
- We're working on it. Adam?

220
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,073
I've got the longitude,
but I don't have the latitude.

221
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,792
Here, try this.

222
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:09,628
- Adam?
- I'm trying, Tony. I'm working on it.

223
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:16,632
- OK, here it is. 21904 Collins.
- We've got him. We'll send teams from here.

224
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:19,399
Pass the location through to the chopper.

225
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:20,870
Get me Chase.

226
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,594
They got a location.
Tell the chopper to come in.

227
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:28,669
Assemble a team. Take Jane back to CTU.
I want her fully protected.

228
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,712
What are you gonna do to my father?

229
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,990
We're gonna stop him.

230
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,960
I want you to go with her.

231
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,471
We have to make sure these stats are updated
and sent to CTU.

232
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:00,115
Michelle, the test results, they just came in.

233
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,676
Thank you.

234
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,158
<i>- Almeida.
-  Hi, it's me.</i>

235
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,635
What's going on?

236
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:10,429
I'm OK. I'm not infected.

237
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:14,075
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, they did a swab and a blood test.

238
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,397
I'm gonna be fine. I'm gonna be fine.

239
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:22,435
My God. Oh, my God, sweetheart.
That's fantastic.

240
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:25,796
I want you to get outta there,
away from anybody who's infected.

241
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:32,797
No, no. No, sweetheart. They said those of us
that didn't come down with the infection,

242
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,553
we have an immunity to the virus.

243
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:38,240
Where are they taking you?

244
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,874
Downtown. To NHS.

245
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,876
They wanna keep us under watch for
18 hours, but they said it's just a formality.

246
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,709
Look, I'll get there as soon as I can, all right?

247
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,116
No, no. Stay where you are.
They need you at CTU.

248
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:57,199
- I can work from downtown.
- Honey, you don't have to work.

249
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:00,676
- We can handle it from here.
- I wanna help, Tony.

250
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,716
OK.

251
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,633
- Michelle...
- Yeah?

252
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,430
I can't believe I almost lost you.

253
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,599
I almost lost you, too.

254
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,879
- But we're still here.
- Yeah.

255
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,880
I have to go. I'll call you from NHS.

256
00:20:30,915 --> 00:20:32,871
Hey...

257
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,873
I love you.

258
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,598
I love you so much.

259
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,188
Excuse me, can I have your attention, please?

260
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,518
The president has asked you to this
informal setting without recording devices

261
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:13,794
to tell you what relationship the outbreak at
the Chandler Plaza has with airport closures.

262
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,758
Was the Chandler Plaza
why the alert level was raised?

263
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,919
The president will deal with that
in his statement.

264
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:26,479
- Saunders knows we have his daughter?
- He found out about five minutes ago.

265
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,672
- How did he react?
- He broke off communication.

266
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,360
The good news is
CTU has a position on Saunders,

267
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,845
and they're sending in teams now.

268
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:39,908
- What's our confidence level?
- This man knows our system, our protocols.

269
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,869
- He's gonna be tough to corner.
- Stay on top of our response teams.

270
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:47,799
The abduction of his daughter
may have made things worse.

271
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:52,510
- The President of the United States.
- Please be seated.

272
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:56,845
As you know, this morning
our alert level was raised to red.

273
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:01,431
We do have information regarding
a possible biological attack on American soil.

274
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,592
We have maximized
our preparedness across the nation.

275
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:10,352
Now, the best way for our citizens
to ensure their own safety is to stay home.

276
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,632
If you're at work, go home. That's
the message I hope the media can convey.

277
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:19,755
Mr President, we've heard reports that the
local British intelligence office was attacked.

278
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,957
- Is that related?
- I can't release any details on that right now.

279
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:28,348
I'm sorry, Mr President. The people of the city
of Los Angeles are starting to panic,

280
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,829
and information is not flowing
from this office.

281
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,077
We've had outbreaks, quarantines
and now a hint of biological terror...

282
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:39,880
- Carol, please...
- The president has to be more forthcoming.

283
00:22:39,915 --> 00:22:43,509
The president has to be in control,
and so do you.

284
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,872
If you wanna help the public
and do your jobs best,

285
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:51,396
sit quietly and listen to what I have to say.

286
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:56,913
Biological agents do their worst damage
where large groups of people congregate.

287
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,600
The best defence we have right now

288
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:05,431
is to encourage everyone to go home
and stay home and await further instruction.

289
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:13,839
- Chase, this is Jack. Are you en route?
- I'm a little more than ten minutes out.

290
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:16,872
- Will Saunders know we have his location?
- Not likely.

291
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,551
He'll think he had 90 more seconds
before we could lock on to his location.

292
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:25,633
Move into position and remind local
law enforcement to stay out of sight.

293
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,716
<i>- We cannot tip him off.
- Done.</i>

294
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,876
Adam, keep an eye on the satellite.

295
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,516
Track anyone coming in and out of that
building and feed it to local law enforcement.

296
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,795
- Do you copy?
- I'm watching the data now.

297
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,916
<i>- Plug Chloe into it, too.
- Yeah.</i>

298
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:43,397
Listen, everybody, this is our time.
Get it right.

299
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,139
- Stephen, we have to leave.
- We're not leaving.

300
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:48,758
Why not? You said
they'd probably know our location.

301
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,838
- Not probably. They do.
- I don't understand.

302
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:55,031
They've got us on satellite.
They'll pick us up if we try to leave.

303
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,674
So we sit around
and wait till they surround us?

304
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:01,759
Exactly. The more bodies they send,
the easier it'll be for us to disappear.

305
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,877
No, I'm not waiting around to get caught.

306
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,520
- Osterlind!
- I'm leaving, Stephen.

307
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,878
<i>- Yeah?
- Has she left yet?</i>

308
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,717
<i>No.</i>

309
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:36,880
She will. Stay on her.
I'm gonna need to do this soon.

310
00:24:36,915 --> 00:24:38,871
<i>OK.</i>

311
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,950
- Where are we going?
- Los Angeles.

312
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:50,110
- I thought there was an outbreak there.
- Where we're going it'll be safe. Don't worry.

313
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:33,156
- Where in Los Angeles are they taking me?
- A place called CTU.

314
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:36,875
- CTU?
- Yeah, Counter Terrorist Unit.

315
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,115
I still can't believe this.

316
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:49,748
That my father is a terrorist.

317
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:57,948
Four years ago when I found out he was alive
after all that time... I was so happy.

318
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,871
I had a father.

319
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,714
I let myself believe all that he wanted me to.

320
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,831
That he was this wonderful man.

321
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,870
How often did you see him?

322
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:22,838
A couple of times a year.

323
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:28,958
Sometimes he'd surprise me,
and he'd always bring me something.

324
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:36,032
And it was always perfect. Like he knew.

325
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,231
- Maybe he did know.
- What do you mean?

326
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,845
He had people watching you, Jane.

327
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:48,829
He knew more about your life
than you're probably aware of.

328
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:55,879
What am I supposed to do
with all these feelings for him?

329
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,395
The person I love doesn't even exist.

330
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,845
What's gonna happen to him?

331
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:10,872
My dad's gonna try and bring him in.

332
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,879
Adam, what's the status
of Saunders' location?

333
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,911
No one's left the building.

334
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:25,272
- Who's working with us?
- LAPD have surrounded the area.

335
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,845
<i>- They're hidden from view.
- Good work.</i>

336
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,155
- I'll be there in a few minutes.
- All right.

337
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:34,273
<i>- That information's correct.
- You're absolutely sure?</i>

338
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:37,870
<i>- I checked myself.
- Thank you very much.</i>

339
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:45,195
What's the status of the simulation?

340
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,880
- Tony, I need to talk to you.
- Just a second.

341
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:52,436
- Put those simulations on my system.
- I need to talk to you right now.

342
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:55,832
I'll catch you up. Go ahead.

343
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:59,190
- What is it?
- I've been working on the quarantine areas.

344
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,355
And?

345
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,439
I've been over the list of people who have
been isolated and found a familiar name.

346
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,870
And?

347
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,117
One of them is Sarah Kaufman.

348
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,471
- Who's Sarah Kaufman?
- Adam's sister.

349
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:18,872
- You sure it's Adam's sister?
- Yeah. She tested positive.

350
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:21,753
In the medical sense. She's gonna die.

351
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,845
- Thanks.
- You're not gonna tell him?

352
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:30,838
- Yeah, I have to.
- We still have a lot of work to do.

353
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:35,317
How can he concentrate knowing that
his sister's gonna die in a couple of hours?

354
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:39,877
Chloe, I'm getting real tired
of your personality.

355
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:44,875
- I'm just trying to help.
- You wanna help? Get back to work.

356
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,760
Adam, could you come with me for a second?

357
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,269
I'm sitting on these satellite feeds.
Can it wait?

358
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,472
No, it can't. Chloe'll watch it.

359
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:02,792
Fine. What is it?
Tony, I really have to stay on this.

360
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:08,432
- It's personal. Just come with me.
- Just tell me. Did I do something wrong?

361
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,312
No.

362
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:13,398
I'm afraid I have some bad news for you.

363
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,798
Your sister Sarah's
in one of the quarantine zones.

364
00:29:16,833 --> 00:29:20,077
- What?
- You have a sister named Sarah, right?

365
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,395
Yeah, but how can they be sure it's her?

366
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,438
There have to be a hundred
Sarah Kaufman in Los Angeles.

367
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:28,870
Chloe confirmed it.

368
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,913
Have they kept her away
from the people that are infected?

369
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,349
She's infected.

370
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:39,871
What are you saying, Tony?
Are you telling me that Sarah's gonna die?

371
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:43,396
It looks that way, yeah. I'm sorry.

372
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,996
Oh, my God.

373
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:53,514
Look, Adam, I'm gonna give you a chance
to talk to your sister,

374
00:29:53,549 --> 00:29:57,509
but then I'm gonna need you to stay on
until the crisis passes.

375
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,593
You think you can do that?

376
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,436
Adam?

377
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,591
Cos we need you here.

378
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,879
- Yeah.
- All right.

379
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,995
<i>- No other way out?
- No.</i>

380
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,998
<i>- I'm completely surrounded.
- How do you know?</i>

381
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,510
A security guard across the street
made his rounds every 15 minutes.

382
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:37,475
He missed his last rotation, which means
CTU has taken over that building.

383
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,160
<i>What are you gonna do?</i>

384
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:43,317
I'm gonna wait until Bauer gets here.

385
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:47,990
Baker and his team are behind the building.
They'll move when we say.

386
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,873
LAPD's set up a perimeter here,
here, here and here.

387
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,873
We got SWAT teams moving in this way
and from over here. Snipers on the roof.

388
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:59,038
- Nobody goes until we give the word.
- What's the situation?

389
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:03,239
We've taken over buildings on either side.
We've got snipers on the roof ready to go.

390
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:06,073
- Phones?
- We didn't jam the area. You said he'd know.

391
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:10,876
- What about infrared?
- We can't get through the walls, Jack.

392
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:20,231
- He knows we're here.
- What makes you say that?

393
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:23,520
- Cos I would.
- You think he's still in there?

394
00:31:23,555 --> 00:31:25,476
- Yeah.
- Why wouldn't he try to escape?

395
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:29,479
I don't know. On my signal, move
into position, minimum three men per exit.

396
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,955
No one goes in till I give the order.

397
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,548
Assume Saunders has taken
defensive measures.

398
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:37,319
Everybody ready? Let's go.

399
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,637
All teams move into first position.
This is a go.

400
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,231
- In position. All set.
- OK. Let's go.

401
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:43,794
Stephen Saunders, this is Jack Bauer.

402
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:47,350
You're completely surrounded.

403
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:51,359
The president has refused
to capitulate to any further demands.

404
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:55,314
I need to remind you
that we still have your daughter.

405
00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:01,390
Stephen, it's over. The only way
you're getting out of this thing alive

406
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:06,196
is coming through the front door
with your hands on your head.

407
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:09,278
That's not exactly true, Jack.

408
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:47,035
- Adam.
- Not now, Chloe.

409
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:49,196
I'm running comm on the Saunders pick-up.

410
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:53,598
I know what you're doing. Robin, take over
Adam's screen for a minute. Come here.

411
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:56,359
Why? Chloe, this is really not a good time.

412
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,153
- Tony, you need to hear this.
- What?

413
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,510
I have to report some bad news.

414
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:05,428
We lost two satellite feeds because
Adam forgot to segregate the channels.

415
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,516
- What?
- I checked your system.

416
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:10,677
- I had to reinitiate everything.
- You touched my system?

417
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,880
Adam shouldn't be here. He's under duress
because his sister's gonna die.

418
00:35:14,915 --> 00:35:18,270
- I did not forget to separate those channels.
- Yes, you did.

419
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,870
We don't have time for this.
Teams on the ground are depending on us.

420
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:25,828
- Did you back up the satellite data?
- Yes. We lost about 30 seconds.

421
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:29,793
We didn't lose it, Chloe.
I can prove it to you right now.

422
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,474
I thought that I...

423
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:46,156
Chloe's right. I forgot to separate them.

424
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:51,671
All right, look, you made a mistake.

425
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:57,230
I need to know if you can get through the rest
of the day without making another one.

426
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,839
Adam?

427
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:03,839
I'm fine, Tony.

428
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,154
OK.

429
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,237
I don't agree with Tony's decision.

430
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:14,831
I'm gonna double-check your logs every
ten minutes, in case you screw up again.

431
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:31,838
Jack, what do you wanna do? If he's not
in there, we're wasting time we don't have.

432
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:35,509
<i>Just have the men maintain their position.</i>

433
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,876
<i>- This is Bauer.
- Congratulations, Jack.</i>

434
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:44,312
<i>- You found me.
- Stephen, it's over. Come on out.</i>

435
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:48,313
It would suit me better
if you came in here and got me.

436
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:51,910
I'd hate to be in the cross hairs
of all those unstable CTU snipers.

437
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,755
Come out the front door with your hands
on your head. You'll be fine.

438
00:36:55,880 --> 00:37:00,908
11 more vials, millions dead.
That doesn't affect your nerves a little bit?

439
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:06,234
The president's made himself clear.
He's not following orders from you any more.

440
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,351
I work for him.

441
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:12,314
If that's the case, you won't mind
if I take a few minutes to think things over.

442
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:16,877
While you're thinking things over,
you might wanna think about your daughter.

443
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:23,589
Tony just confirmed that he's in the building.

444
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:27,593
All teams hold your position.
We got confirmation.

445
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:36,440
<i>- Is it done?
- Yes.</i>

446
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,790
All right. Stay on the line.

447
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:46,435
<i>- Almeida.
- Listen to me very carefully, Agent Almeida.</i>

448
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,869
- Who is this?
- It's Stephen Saunders.

449
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,834
Before you make any tactical errors,
here's an update on the situation.

450
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,598
I'm listening.

451
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:58,880
Move to a private area that has direct comm
with your teams on site here.

452
00:37:58,915 --> 00:38:00,791
Why would I do that?

453
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:06,880
Open a web socket to IP 257-211-16-5
and you'll find out.

454
00:38:06,915 --> 00:38:10,873
<i>That's IP 257-211-16-5.</i>

455
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:14,400
Just trust me. Do it.

456
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:20,313
By the way,
I'd like to offer you congratulations

457
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:24,797
on your wife eluding infection from the virus.

458
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,916
How do you know about my wife?

459
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,873
<i>Get on that site.</i>

460
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:41,552
<i>I did instruct them to leave her barely
functional so that we can return her to you.</i>

461
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:45,719
I'll kill you, you son of a bitch.
I'll rip your damn throat out, you hear me?

462
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:48,360
I'm low on time.
Sorry if I brush past that remark.

463
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:52,877
In 15 seconds Michelle will be dead
if you don't do what I say.

464
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:59,836
There are five agents watching
the northeast exit of this building,

465
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:02,440
four on the ground
and a sniper on the rooftop.

466
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,516
I assume they're operating as a unit.

467
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:08,872
I want you to give them a code nine,
send them to the front entrance now.

468
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,515
Jack Bauer's running the operation.
I don't have the authority.

469
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,598
No authority. Really?

470
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,598
- Kevin, is Michelle still conscious?
- Yes.

471
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:22,678
Take an eye out.

472
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,876
No, wait! Stop!

473
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,876
Kevin, hold for a second.

474
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:36,394
It's gonna take me some time.

475
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:38,397
You have 30 seconds.

476
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:53,556
Gerry, we're talking about mass hysteria
spreading out all over the place.

477
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:58,879
- We're not in any position to mobilize...
- Our position is to let the public know.

478
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:10,156
- This is Baker.
- This is Tony Almeida.

479
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:13,631
Switch to channel three.

480
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,149
- Go ahead.
- We need you to code nine your team.

481
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,845
I want you to use a controlled channel.

482
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,713
- What are we doing?
- Move everyone to the front now.

483
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:25,992
- There's nothing going on at the front.
- We got a sat feed Jack doesn't have yet.

484
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:28,880
Saunders is on the move in a blind spot.
Get there now.

485
00:40:28,915 --> 00:40:30,996
Four CTU personnel diverting to new mark.

486
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:35,989
No, Baker, not just CTU personnel. Everyone,
police control included. Get there now!

487
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:39,635
We have a code nine.
Everyone to the front of the building now!

488
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:44,117
Get in your car and move to the front
of the building. Down, down!
