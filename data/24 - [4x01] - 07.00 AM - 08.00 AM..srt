1
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,749
I can't reach her!

2
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,274
Please help me.

3
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,634
I can't move.

4
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:15,156
There's two more
trapped inside that one.

5
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,835
Help me. I... I can't move. Oh, my God.

6
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,360
Sarah, save what you're doing. I need you.

7
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,273
- What is it?
- I just heard from one of our sources.

8
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:34,356
There's a probability that someone from our
FBI watch list was spotted in LA yesterday.

9
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:40,033
- Tomas Sherek. Who is he?
- He's worked with terror cells near Istanbul.

10
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,317
He's suspected of coordinating
suicide bombings last summer.

11
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,630
Istanbul?

12
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:50,032
There was some chatter this morning about
a possible attack by a group out of Turkey.

13
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,634
Here it is. From Ankara.

14
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,076
- What was the target?
- East Coast. New York or DC.

15
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,151
- But the time window passed.
- Passed?

16
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:03,109
The targeted time is for 8am.
It's already past ten on the East Coast.

17
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,476
What if they got the target wrong
and it's West Coast time?

18
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,711
Then it's gonna go down within the hour.

19
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,993
- Tell Curtis. I'll take this to Driscoll.
- I can take it.

20
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,516
- Why?
- I thought you wanted to keep working it up.

21
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:24,197
You're really transparent. Stop trying
to be Driscoll's pet. She doesn't like it.

22
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,194
Any voice confirmation
from anyone on the train?

23
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,874
<i> No. The signals just confirmed a bomb. </i>

24
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:36,511
<i>We're trying to get in contact. It's in a remote</i>
<i>area, but local police are heading there. </i>

25
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,318
All right.

26
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,039
We have discretionary authority
out of Point Mugu.

27
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,671
Have them direct a patrol aircraft over the
area. Put the pilot in contact with our people.

28
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:51,471
- <i>Should we monitor emergency services?</i>
- No. County will cover that.

29
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,033
A truck full of C-4
derailed a train in Santa Clarita.

30
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,759
Free up some people.
Division's gonna send data.

31
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,832
- That could be related to what we found.
- What did you find?

32
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:06,835
Two things. First, intelligence indicated the
possibility of an attack at eight this morning.

33
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:10,674
Bombing was at seven. That's within an hour.
What's the second thing?

34
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:16,357
A Turkish national on the FBI watch list,
Tomas Sherek, was last seen in the city.

35
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:20,558
- He could be related to the bombing.
- OK. Open up channels with Division.

36
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:24,189
Start investigating this bombing.
Work up what you have on Sherek.

37
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,589
We'll brief in a few minutes.

38
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,517
What about the Defense Department meeting?
It's in a half hour.

39
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,636
Who's Secretary Heller sending?

40
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,915
Jack Bauer.

41
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,150
Jack? Are you sure?

42
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,836
Yeah. He hasn't been back...
well, since you fired him.

43
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,633
- Is it gonna be uncomfortable?
- What?

44
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,677
Going back to CTU. Seeing Driscoll again.

45
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,990
I don't blame her for her decision.

46
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,595
How can that be? She forced you out of CTU.

47
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,592
She didn't want an ex-junkie.
That's not unreasonable.

48
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,990
You weren't a junkie.
You were doing your job.

49
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,469
I was addicted to heroin.

50
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,994
It didn't matter why.

51
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,910
Do you miss your old job?

52
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,278
I could have joined other agencies
if I still wanted to do field work.

53
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,395
But I didn't.

54
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,475
I wanted something different from my life.

55
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:01,674
It might not seem like a lot to you.

56
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,751
But for me...

57
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,990
To be able to have this
kind of a connection with someone...

58
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,674
I couldn't do that before.

59
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,154
I'm glad you can now.

60
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,959
- We'd better go.
- Yeah.

61
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:29,953
Secretary Heller's gonna be
in the lobby in five minutes.

62
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,678
- Secretary Heller?
- Yeah.

63
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:36,754
I called him Dad once in a press conference
so I decided then to use his title all the time.

64
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,308
Audrey...

65
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,358
Your father's a very perceptive man.

66
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:46,035
I would like to tell him about us
before he finds out on his own.

67
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,917
Look...

68
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,480
My dad is kind of old-fashioned.

69
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:55,951
Even though Paul and I are separated,
he still considers us married.

70
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:59,953
I understand that. And I don't want
your father to draw the wrong conclusion

71
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:03,032
and think that I had
anything to do with the break-up.

72
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,076
Yeah, but you didn't.

73
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,392
Please, Jack.

74
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,040
Let's just give it a little more time.

75
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:15,999
I'm gonna tell you something
and I don't want you to panic.

76
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,439
I'm falling in love with you.

77
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,830
Look, I don't want you to say anything.

78
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,559
And I don't need you to feel the same way.

79
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,274
I just wanted you to know.

80
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,232
- I will see you downstairs.
- Yeah.

81
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,511
All right. This is what we have.

82
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:07,799
A known terrorist named Tomas Sherek
managed to enter the country undetected.

83
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:11,316
There's a likelihood Sherek
helped organise the train attack.

84
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,472
If he did, he's gonna get
out of the country as fast as he can.

85
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,791
Which means we have
a small window of opportunity here.

86
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,110
Who's covering airports and customs?

87
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,556
I am. I've issued a mandate
to LAX, Long Beach and Ontario.

88
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:27,599
As usual, Edgar, we can't hear you.
Where's your laptop if you need to pull data?

89
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:32,913
Sorry, I'll speak up. And I don't need
my laptop. I have everything memorised.

90
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,993
What I was saying is that I've asked
all the airports to add a layer of security.

91
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,277
- Any local contacts for Sherek?
- I'm looking into those now.

92
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:44,194
All right. Promote everything
we receive up to Division.

93
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:48,751
Let's find Sherek
before he leaves the city. Let's go.

94
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,278
Excuse me. Do you think it's a mistake
to assume Sherek is on his way out of LA?

95
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,557
- No.
- But the timing on the intel doesn't match.

96
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,996
It said 8am and the train bombing
happened around seven.

97
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,389
Just focus on finding Sherek.

98
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,790
- <i> Yes. </i>
- It's Tomas.

99
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,429
- <i>Did Dar get the briefcase?</i>
- Yes. He's on his way to you now.

100
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:17,193
<i>Good. You did well, Tomas. </i>

101
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,953
- What about Maurice?
- <i>He's waiting for you. </i>

102
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,634
He has everything you need.

103
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:34,949
- Behrooz, are you eating with us?
- I'll be right down, Mom.

104
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,596
- I'm concerned about him.
- Concerned? Why?

105
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:49,310
- I think he's still seeing this American girl.
- You said you'd talk to him.

106
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,995
I did. I told him he was no longer
allowed to have contact with her.

107
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:56,117
And he agreed, right?

108
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,758
Yes.

109
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,559
But I think he's still seeing her
behind our backs.

110
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,313
- I'll speak to him.
- No.

111
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,994
I'll take care of it.

112
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:17,830
Behrooz, we're sitting down to eat.

113
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,275
- Behrooz.
- I'm on the phone.

114
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:23,750
Get off and come down now.

115
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,478
- Who is he talking to?
- I don't know.

116
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,431
Sorry.

117
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:39,752
- Who were you on the phone with?
- My friend Scott.

118
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:45,231
- You were talking to that American girl.
- No, I told you, I don't see her any more.

119
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,515
Don't lie to me, Behrooz!

120
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,398
I hear your phone calls at night.
I read your emails.

121
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:55,952
- You read my emails? That's my business!
- Don't you raise your voice to your father.

122
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:00,955
While you live under my roof,
there is no such thing as your business.

123
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:05,670
No more communications with that girl.
Do you understand me?

124
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,636
Don't look at her. You're talking to me.

125
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,828
Yes, sir.

126
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,957
<i>... where a horrible tragedy</i>
<i>struck a short time ago. </i>

127
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:20,068
<i>An early morning commuter train collided with</i>
<i>a truck that was apparently crossing the track. </i>

128
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:24,073
<i>Reports are coming in that most</i>
<i>of the passengers were severely injured. </i>

129
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,310
<i>Casualty estimates as high as 30.</i>

130
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:30,552
<i>NTSB agents have arrived on the scene</i>
<i>and are investigating the cause. </i>

131
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:34,030
<i>At this time, the authorities</i>
<i>are not saying if this was an accident</i>

132
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:38,910
<i>or a targeted attack,</i>
<i>but, as you can see, there has been... </i>

133
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,798
So far, everything is on schedule.

134
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,235
- Have you spoken to Tomas?
- Yes.

135
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:49,189
The briefcase is on its way to us now. When it
gets here, you'll take it to the warehouse.

136
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,475
Why doesn't Dar take it there directly?

137
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:57,351
He doesn't need to know where our people
are working. That's the safest way.

138
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,031
Behrooz...

139
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:04,272
If your father seems severe,
it's because our job here is a difficult one.

140
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:08,911
If we are to succeed,
it's important that we are of a single mind.

141
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,671
I understand.

142
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,233
What we will accomplish today
will change the world.

143
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:24,553
We're fortunate that our family
has been chosen to do this.

144
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,676
We cannot fail.

145
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,755
Yes, Father.

146
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,551
Morning, Jennifer.

147
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,675
- What are you doing here so early?
- I'm not here early.

148
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,672
- You've been here all night?
- Yeah.

149
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,960
- What are you working on?
- Nothing right now.

150
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:15,953
I'm just stealing some software
from Adobe and Microsoft.

151
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:19,555
You're gonna get caught one of these days.

152
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,358
Hey, Melanie.

153
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,432
Don't tell anybody or I'll have to kill you.

154
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,875
What the hell is this?

155
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,434
Whoa.

156
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,114
Melanie, come look at this.

157
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:56,152
Looks like someone's
trying to corrupt the Internet.

158
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,038
Yeah, but it hasn't started propagating yet.

159
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,429
They're just placing the nodes.

160
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,676
Look at this.

161
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:09,276
- This could tank every system in the world.
- You've gotta tell somebody.

162
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,876
If I call the feds from here, they'll trace
the call. They'll know I was stealing code.

163
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:17,032
Then do it from a payphone.

164
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,712
Yeah.

165
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,597
I'm up to speed on the train bombing.
How many confirmed dead?

166
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,910
32.
- I didn't know that.

167
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,639
- Call Carl.
- I will. Thanks, Al.

168
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,029
- 32 dead.
- What's the initial assessment?

169
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,111
An act of terrorism.

170
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:45,590
When you get to CTU, I want you
to find out all the details and call me.

171
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:51,357
And listen... I don't want anyone, except you
two, to know about this meeting with Richard.

172
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,998
Of course.

173
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,792
I tried to get ahold of you last night.
Where were you?

174
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:01,111
- I had dinner with a friend.
- Anyone I know?

175
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,633
No.

176
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,397
- Jack.
- Sir.

177
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,594
I'll call you when I get to CTU.

178
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,516
Yeah, I'll get her. Hold on.

179
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,270
- O'Brian.
- Chloe, it's Edgar Stiles.

180
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,353
You don't need to use your last name.
You've been here over a month. What is it?

181
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,238
I got a friend of yours.
He says he needs to talk to you.

182
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,311
- Who, Edgar?
- <i>His name is Andrew Paige. </i>

183
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,789
Fine. Put him through.

184
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:44,039
- <i> Hello?</i>
- I can't take personal calls here.

185
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:49,240
It's not personal. I found something
on the Net I think you should know about.

186
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:52,835
There's a fake NAT table
and several large corporate routers.

187
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,388
- It was loaded this morning.
- How would you know?

188
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:58,597
I was trying to download some software
and I noticed it.

189
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:02,434
By download, I assume you mean steal,
or you wouldn't have seen a NAT table.

190
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,350
OK, fine.

191
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,954
But I hacked deeper
and I found all kinds of stuff.

192
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,076
What kind of stuff?

193
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,912
I think someone's positioning code

194
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,230
for a major Internet attack.

195
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:15,198
The thing is, not all
the code remarks are in English.

196
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,999
- What language were they in?
- <i>I don't know. </i>

197
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:23,108
It looked Middle Eastern.
Like Arabic or Turkish, maybe.

198
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:27,237
- You find something?
- Sarah was working on Sherek's contacts.

199
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:31,393
The system flagged Maurice Landstrass.
He owns a dry-cleaners in Studio City.

200
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:35,712
We found his business is owned by a holding
company based out of Ankara, Turkey.

201
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:41,477
All right. Give this to Ronnie, tell him
to get over there and see what he can find.

202
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,154
- Excuse me, Miss Driscoll.
- What is it, Chloe?

203
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,595
I just got a call from an old classmate.

204
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:50,070
He noticed some high-profile
Internet nodes have been compromised.

205
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,357
- This could be related to our present threat.
- Why?

206
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,353
A computer network virus was launched
this morning from a server in Turkey.

207
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,592
That's where Sherek is from.
Should I start working it up?

208
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,079
No.

209
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:09,156
The bombing and Sherek are all we should
be dealing with now. But pass it to the FBI.

210
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,354
- Excuse me, sir. Can I help you?
- Yes, I have a meeting with Erin Driscoll.

211
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,273
Jack. It's OK, Sarah. This is Jack Bauer.

212
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,669
Oh. Mr Bauer. I'm sorry.

213
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,716
No, it's fine.

214
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,870
Chloe, how have you been?

215
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,269
Not perfect, but OK.
How are Kim and Chase?

216
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:01,558
Good. They just got a house in Valencia.
Kim's taking care of Angela.

217
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,870
Chase works for a private security company.

218
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:08,397
That's interesting... I mean, I'm interested,
I just have to set up a protocol.

219
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,072
Yeah.

220
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,391
- Jack.
- Curtis. Is Erin ready for our meeting?

221
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:20,677
Almost, but I should tell you,
you'll probably get cut short.

222
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,752
- The train bombing in Santa Clarita.
- Among other things.

223
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,673
- What other things?
- I won't bore you with it.

224
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,877
- We're out.
- OK, we'll have you on voice three, data four.

225
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:33,270
- Ronnie, Jack Bauer. Jack, Ronnie Lobell.
- Nice to meet you.

226
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,432
- Hey, Jack.
- Ronnie's got your old job, head of field ops.

227
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:40,991
- Yeah, I know. How's it going?
- It's busy. It was nice meeting you.

228
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,710
Would you rather reschedule this?

229
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,189
That won't be necessary.
Erin will be free soon.

230
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:50,353
Tell you what, why don't you
use this station to make any calls.

231
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:53,318
- It won't be long.
- OK, thank you.

232
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,680
I don't know, Max. Let me find out.

233
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,150
It's a Vandenberg representative.
How long will they be pushed back?

234
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:26,118
Don't change anything with Vandenberg.

235
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:31,274
We'll stick to the original schedule.
OK, Max. Yep. We'll see you then.

236
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,554
- Have you spoken with your brother?
- No.

237
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,029
I don't think he knows I'm coming with you.

238
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,429
It's probably best that he doesn't.

239
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,592
All right. I'll stay in the car.

240
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,513
Dad, if Richard goes to this protest
in Lockheed, it's not the end of the world.

241
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,114
- It's not a page-one story.
- That's not the point.

242
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:56,273
It's an embarrassment to me
and to the president.

243
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:02,552
- What are you gonna say to him?
- I have no idea.

244
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,474
What gets to me is he doesn't know
the first thing about the politics of this.

245
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:10,439
- He's doing it to rebel against you.
- Since when am I the enemy? What did I do?

246
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:16,072
Nothing. Richard's acting like a spoilt child.
He's gonna have to grow up someday.

247
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,037
- Audrey Raines.
- <i> It's the president calling. </i>

248
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,190
It's the president's office.

249
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:30,595
- Heller here.
- <i>Please hold for the president. </i>

250
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:33,069
- <i> James. </i>
- Yes, Mr President.

251
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,549
<i>I'm thinking of raising the terror alert level. </i>

252
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,710
<i> Because of the train bombing?</i>

253
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:41,076
No, not just that.
Langley's picked up some chatter.

254
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:45,039
We have intel on watch-listed individuals
who've gotten into the country.

255
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:49,796
My instinct is to wait
until the NTSB weighs in on the bombing.

256
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:53,589
In the meantime,
we can increase our state of readiness.

257
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,638
All right. I'll take that into consideration.

258
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,554
I'm meeting with the secretary of state
and Director Shaye in a few minutes.

259
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,474
- I'll see if they feel the same about it.
- Yes, Mr President.

260
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,391
Thank you.

261
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:16,832
- Hello, Erin.
- Hello, Jack.

262
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:21,234
- I'm sorry Secretary Heller couldn't be here.
- It's just as well.

263
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:24,118
I'm sure you were told
we have a protocol in progress.

264
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,351
So why don't we just go down the items
and get it over with?

265
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,034
That's fine with me.

266
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:33,275
I'll be direct with you, Jack.

267
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:37,194
- I didn't like the budget your boss proposed.
- What's the problem?

268
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:42,434
Well, this Department of Defense is asking
for 85 per cent of all interagency monies,

269
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,670
which leaves very little for CTU.

270
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:47,797
If you want a bigger piece,
you're gonna have to justify it.

271
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,633
I have a proposal for you.

272
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,668
Satellite surveillance for harbour traffic?

273
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:02,070
- Yes. Problem?
- Yes. It's insufficient.

274
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:05,118
- You need to maintain bodies on the ground.
- Too expensive.

275
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,873
Not if you utilise intelligence
from other agencies.

276
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:12,431
I am not gonna have Secretary Heller sign off
on a budget that doesn't make sense.

277
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:17,435
- I'll talk to Heller about it myself.
- No, you'll talk to me.

278
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,239
We're not doing this twice.

279
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:24,108
- <i> Erin, Ronnie's arrived at Landstrass'.</i>
- Where's the feed?

280
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,953
<i>On channel one,</i>
<i>as soon as he sets the hidden camera. </i>

281
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,031
Excuse me, Jack.

282
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,351
OK, here we go.

283
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,357
Stand down until I give the order.
Aaron, go around the back.

284
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,238
Sean, you're gonna take the side.

285
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,991
<i> Hello?</i>

286
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:08,878
- <i>Can I help you?</i>
- <i>Are you Mr Landstrass?</i>

287
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,396
- Do I know you?
- Ronnie Lobell. I'm with Los Angeles CTU.

288
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:17,554
I need to ask you a few questions. What do
you know about a man named Tomas Sherek?

289
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,915
<i>I don't know this name. </i>

290
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,951
<i>We have records of you</i>
<i>contacting him in the last two days. </i>

291
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:29,672
- <i>Wasn't me. I run a legitimate business here. </i>
- <i>I never said your business wasn't legitimate. </i>

292
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,196
<i>Look, you just can't</i>
<i>walk in here and harass me. </i>

293
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:36,636
- He's hiding something.
- It's being handled, Jack.

294
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:41,919
Listen to me. His store's open, but the blinds
are closed. There's no other employees.

295
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,949
This guy is way too nervous.
Trust me, he's hiding something.

296
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:53,593
Ronnie, turn your back
on Landstrass for a moment, please.

297
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,358
It says you open at 6am.
Have you been here the entire time?

298
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,079
<i>Yes. What's this about?</i>

299
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,720
Right there.

300
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,597
Do you see that?
Tell him to look for something on his right.

301
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:21,038
Ronnie, on Landstrass' right,
see if there's any place Sherek can be hiding.

302
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,752
- Do you mind if I look behind that counter?
- Yes, I do.

303
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:31,957
Look, this is my store
and I want you to walk out now.

304
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,270
I'm not walking out until I look around.

305
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,794
- Back door!
- On the ground!

306
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,949
He's headed back to you!

307
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,439
It's Sherek. We've got him.

308
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,909
Great job.

309
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:28,673
Remember, Dad,
we're on a tight schedule today.

310
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,837
Richard.

311
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,074
Dad.

312
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,958
- Hello.
Hey, it's me.

313
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:56,589
- <i>Aren't you supposed to be with Driscoll?</i>
- Yeah, she had to step away.

314
00:26:56,680 --> 00:27:01,356
CTU has just picked up a prime suspect in the
train bombing. They're bringing him in now.

315
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:05,911
- My father's still in with Richard.
- I'll brief him later. I wanted to let you know.

316
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,515
- All right. That's good news.
- Yeah. I think so.

317
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,318
All right.

318
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:14,119
- I'll talk to you later.
- Wait, wait.

319
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,951
- What is it?
- Look...

320
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:22,397
About earlier... I don't want you
to think that that made me uncomfortable.

321
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:26,758
- It's just, since Teri died, I never thought I'd...
- Jack, it's all right.

322
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:29,912
- I understand.
- No. No, you don't.

323
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,718
I just want you to know that...

324
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:39,192
I'm falling in love with you, too.

325
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,752
Wow.

326
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:48,436
- You caught me off guard.
- Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

327
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,920
- Driscoll's coming back. I gotta go.
- Then go.

328
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,470
- OK. I'll talk to you when I get a break.
- All right.

329
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:03,956
- What's happening with the suspect?
- Ronnie's bringing him in.

330
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,554
- Who is he?
- Fortunately for you, Jack,

331
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,596
it's our problem, not yours.

332
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,679
Right.

333
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:17,031
I'm going, Dad.
And there's nothing you can do to stop me.

334
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,554
How many cars do you need to get places?

335
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:22,279
I didn't come here
to argue about the environment.

336
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:25,591
I didn't ask you to come at all.

337
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:32,792
I do not want you to attend or to speak
at that rally at Lockheed this afternoon.

338
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,839
You don't have leverage over what I do.
Not since I stopped taking your money.

339
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:39,354
Can't you think of anything besides yourself?

340
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:44,798
If you do this, it will humiliate the president,
and it will be dangerous to national security.

341
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:49,749
What could be more dangerous
than 2500 missile delivery systems?

342
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,832
Spare me your sixth-grade
Michael Moore logic.

343
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:57,675
The world is a little bit more complicated
than that, Richard. We do not live in a utopia.

344
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,876
America has enemies.

345
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:04,750
Enemies who were our friends a year ago,
and in another year, it'll change again,

346
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:08,515
unless people stop supporting your
psychotic need to control the world.

347
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:12,275
Psychotic need? We serve our country!

348
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:15,477
We serve the cause of freedom.
What do you do?

349
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:20,909
Why don't you just go back
to your little motorcade and drive somewhere

350
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,719
where people actually buy
the lies you're selling.

351
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:28,271
OK, look. We don't have to do this, OK?
We do not have to.

352
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:31,397
Fine, Dad. What do you wanna do?

353
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:37,475
Do not disrespect me. I am your father!

354
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:08,435
Nothing. It was my friend, not me.

355
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,909
What's his name?
- Andrew.

356
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,072
- Andrew what?
- Andrew Paige.

357
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:19,278
- Who did you tell?
- I swear, we didn't tell anyone. I don't know.

358
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:23,069
- Don't lie to me.
- He just stumbled on the site and logged out.

359
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:25,799
Don't lie to me!

360
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,954
Where is Andrew Paige now?

361
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:35,551
I was just doing my work. I don't...

362
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:31,599
Use station five. Chloe's opened up a socket.
You can access the records volumes

363
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:35,275
- to look at those budget numbers.
- OK, fine.

364
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,274
- I know this guy.
- Sherek?

365
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,669
When I was here, we knew him as Jann Bolek.

366
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:48,469
We linked him to over a dozen bombings
in Europe in the late '90s.

367
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:52,109
We weren't able to stop him
from today's attack, but we did catch him.

368
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:57,638
Jack, I'm sorry I was abrupt before.
You helped us with the takedown. Thank you.

369
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,792
Erin, listen to me.

370
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:09,475
This doesn't make sense.
I know this guy's file, he's a major handler.

371
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:15,112
He wouldn't risk exposing himself here in the
US for a train bombing. It's not big enough.

372
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,078
We'll consider that when we interrogate him.

373
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:21,311
Give my best to Secretary Heller.

374
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,871
- Chloe.
- What?

375
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:33,397
The original data on Sherek - was there
any indication of a secondary strike?

376
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:37,917
No. Everything supports that he was here for
the bombing. There was a time discrepancy.

377
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,639
- What?
- There was some high-probability chatter

378
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,598
indicating an attack at 8am.
The bombing was at seven.

379
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:46,319
They didn't give a window?
It was for a specific time?

380
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:51,155
Yeah, but the intel was off by an hour.
Driscoll thought it was close enough.

381
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:54,835
- You can't do that.
- What's your logon for Interpol overnights?

382
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:58,071
- I'm not comfortable doing this.
- Chloe, please.

383
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,998
You're in.

384
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:16,673
- Is this the source?
- Yes, that's the decipher.

385
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:24,831
An 8am strike, unless target deviates. Trains
don't deviate. They're on a fixed course.

386
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:30,472
Sometimes when Interpol's breaking codes in
communiqués, it won't use the exact wording.

387
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,630
What are you thinking, Jack?

388
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,234
Sherek didn't come here for a train bombing.

389
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:37,993
Something's gonna happen at eight o'clock.

390
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,878
That's ten minutes from now.

391
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,871
No, Paul. I don't wanna wait.

392
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:02,078
I'm gonna call my lawyer when we get back
to DC. We're gonna get this divorce moving.

393
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:06,551
- <i>We said take a year and see what happens. </i>
- Yeah, but it's almost been a year.

394
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,632
I don't wanna wait any longer.

395
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:11,472
Hang on.

396
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:15,633
Look, I gotta take this call. All right?
We'll talk when I get back to DC.

397
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,439
- Yeah, fine.
- All right. Bye.

398
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,557
- <i> Jack. </i>
- Hey. I need to speak with your father.

399
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:26,349
- He doesn't want to be interrupted.
- It's urgent. I need to get clearance

400
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:30,558
so I can interrogate the suspect in
the bombing. Driscoll won't let me near him.

401
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:33,757
I believe he's got information
on a secondary hit, a larger one.

402
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:37,037
- It's supposed to take place at 8am.
- It's almost eight now.

403
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:40,635
- I know. That's why I need to speak with him.
- All right. Hang on.

404
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:50,831
I'm gonna speak at that rally
this afternoon, Dad.

405
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:53,878
And it's not because I hate you.

406
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:56,235
It's cos it's something I believe in.

407
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:00,029
Did it ever occur to you
that these people are using you?

408
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:04,352
Don't you realise they're letting you speak
for one reason and one reason only?

409
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:07,876
Because you are my son!

410
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:11,274
I wish I weren't.

411
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:21,036
- What is it?
- I'm sorry. It's Jack. It's urgent.

412
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,633
Excuse me, Richard.

413
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:26,030
What could be more important
than intimidating me?

414
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,555
I didn't know you were hiding in the car.

415
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:33,518
Richie, why are you doing this to Dad?
Can't you back off?

416
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:37,593
- I'm not doing anything to him.
- If you go to that protest, it's gonna hurt him.

417
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:41,719
Whatever it takes to stop what he's doing.

418
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:46,715
Jack, if I step on Driscoll's toes and it doesn't
pay off, I'll have political fallout to deal with.

419
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:52,352
I understand, but I wouldn't ask if I didn't
believe there was a threat to national security.

420
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:55,716
Share your concerns with Driscoll.
Let CTU handle it.

421
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,792
- Sir, there isn't time.
- It's the president.

422
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:03,078
Jack, it's the president.
I gotta go. I'll see you at Vandenberg.

423
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,957
Yes, sir.

424
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:34,394
How long have you been in Los Angeles?

425
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:37,074
Who are you working with?

426
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,315
We don't have time for this.
Listen to me.

427
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:46,997
Unless you start giving me answers, you're
gonna end up in a hole for the next 30 years.

428
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,674
Who are you working with?

429
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,914
Why did you bomb that train?

430
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:16,717
- How far can I push this guy?
- We have to find out who he's working with.

431
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,793
We should go as far as we have to.
Maybe we should bring Johnson in.

432
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:29,313
- Sorry, sir. This area's off limits.
- Oh, I'm looking for Erin Driscoll.

433
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,315
Jack! Jack, what are you doing?
Call security now.

434
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,870
- What is happening at eight?
- Son of a bitch. He's jammed the codes.

435
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:52,715
I am not messing with you. You are gonna
tell me. What is happening at eight o'clock?

436
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,394
Holster your weapon!

437
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:58,870
Jack! I said holster your weapon.

438
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,752
- Call medical.
- What is your primary objective?

439
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:05,559
- I'll order security to shoot you!
- Get that door open!

440
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:08,279
What is your primary objective?

441
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,555
Secretary of Defense!

442
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,118
Heller.

443
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,952
- Secretary Heller?
- Yes.

444
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:19,157
Secretary Heller's the target.
Call Secret Service now.

445
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:23,438
- Call now! Get a team on the way.
Secret Service now.

446
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,432
Yeah, I'll hold.

447
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:29,354
The president wants us back in DC tonight.

448
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:33,956
- What meetings can we eject?
- Not Vandenberg. The media's expecting you.

449
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:39,637
Maybe we could skip Paradigm and handle
that with a teleconference next week.

450
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:42,156
Come on, pick up the phone!

451
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:45,835
Tell the president we'll rearrange
and fly back this afternoon.

452
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:48,798
- Yeah.
- Audrey, it's Jack. Are you still at Richard's?

453
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,155
- Yeah.
- Get your father out of there now!

454
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:55,518
The bombing this morning was diversionary.
Your father is the real target. Get out!

455
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,670
- Target?
- Audrey!

456
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,990
Oh, my God.

457
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:07,556
Audrey?

458
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:30,433
On your feet!
On your feet!

459
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:33,193
Jack! No! Jack!

460
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,396
- Audrey!
- Jack! Jack!

461
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,311
Let her go!

462
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,669
Let me go.

463
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,829
<i> Jack! Help!</i>

464
