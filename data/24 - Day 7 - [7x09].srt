**********

5
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,830
You son of a bitch.

6
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:18,210
You're behind my son's death.

7
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:21,000
Madame president... I have your husbanD.

8
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:26,010
You will have your forces withdrawn from around
my country, sangala, immediately and permanently.

9
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:28,960
Or your husband will die
a slow and certain death.

10
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,990
I just wanted to make sure that you
were still coming to dinner tonight.

11
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:34,760
Marika, I can'T. I'll make it up to you.

12
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:37,140
If you're looking for
marika, she's not with me.

13
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:38,950
I'm looking for you, samuel.

14
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:41,060
Or whatever your real name is.

15
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,490
Now, I don't know who you
really are, and I don't care.

16
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:45,780
I just want you out of my sister's life.

17
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:58,640
Keep an incident quiet until what
jack and i are doing goes down.

18
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,980
What incident?

19
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:01,910
Vossler's dead.

20
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,810
Jack killed him at the hotel on
18th and reagan. It was self-defense.

21
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:07,420
Damn it, renee, what the hell
are you doing with this guy?

22
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:09,890
You're supposed to bring
suspects in, not murder them.

23
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,790
Until we know who dubaku's source is there,
you've got to handle this outside of the bureau.

24
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:15,980
Dubaku is the only person
with the names of the people

25
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:18,890
who betrayed you within your government
it's imperative that we find him.

26
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:24,240
You resigned from government service and the
senate regards you as having been a renegade agent.

27
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:27,990
How am I supposed to know
where your loyalties really lie?

28
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:32,260
With all due respect,
madame president, ask around.

29
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:34,920
I got an address for henry taylor.

30
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,640
Get an ambulance!

31
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:51,950
*********

32
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,050
no one else gets
through here. Follow me.

33
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:09,730
It's henry taylor, the president's husband, but
that information is not to be disseminated. Clear?

34
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:19,590
I...

35
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,730
mr. Taylor, don't speak. I
need you to save your energy.

36
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:27,590
over here!

37
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:30,680
Excuse me. Step back, please.

38
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,540
This is unit six. We have a
gunshot trauma to the chest...

39
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:34,550
nine-millimeter round.

40
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,560
Nine
- millimeter substernal. Pulse is rapid.

41
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:38,310
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

42
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,530
I'm gonna call the president.I
want you to search all the rooms,

43
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:44,090
see if you can get anything off their hardware
that's going to tell us where dubaku went.

44
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:51,410
******

45
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,340
This is jack bauer. I need
to speak with the president.

46
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:55,550
Hold one moment, please.

47
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:58,590
Madame president, I would
encourage you not to lose hope.

48
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:01,030
Dubaku knows we tried
to deceive him, ethan.

49
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:03,710
He has no reason to keep henry alive.

50
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,860
jack bauer is on line
one, madame president.

51
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:07,730
Put him through.

52
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,990
Mr. Bauer, this is president taylor.

53
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,000
Madame president, we have your husband.

54
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:15,250
He is alive, but he sustained
a gunshot wound to the chest.

55
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,360
How bad is it?

56
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:18,680
Emts are stabilizing him.

57
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,880
They're getting ready to transfer
him to west arlington hospital.

58
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:25,340
Mr. Bauer, be more specific.
Is my husband going to be okay?

59
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:28,040
We're not gonna know anything
until the doctors see him.

60
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:30,390
Ma'am, I have to warn you,
he has lost a lot of blood.

61
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,090
Jack, it's bill. Do you have dubaku?

62
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,160
Negative-- he was gone
before we got here.

63
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:37,500
Madame president, since your husband was
the only leverage that dubaku had left,

64
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:40,170
it's safe to say that he is
trying to leave the country now.

65
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:42,320
Have you any idea how
he intends to do that?

66
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:43,320
Not at this time.

67
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:45,490
Unfortunately, all his men
were killed during the assault.

68
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:48,420
Agent walker and i will stay behind.
We'll continue to search the area.

69
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:51,720
We have to assume that dubaku has
an exit strategy already in place.

70
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,570
Whatever we're going to do to find
him, we're going to have to do it fast.

71
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:57,810
Yes. Thank you, mr. Bauer.

72
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,500
Please keep me apprised on everything.

73
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:03,380
Yes, ma'am. I'm sorry.

74
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:09,930
I am so sorry, madame president.

75
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:14,820
Ethan, I'm going to the
hospital to be with my husband.

76
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:16,580
Ma'am, that's not possible.

77
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:18,810
You're executing a military invasion.

78
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:23,000
My generals can execute it
perfectly well without me.

79
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:26,260
We can't ignore the fact the
secret service has been compromised.

80
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:28,850
There's no way we can ensure your
safety outside the white house.

81
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:29,920
I don't give a damn.

82
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:34,740
I am not going to be held prisoner in this
office while my husband is fighting for his life.

83
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:38,380
Now, either find someone to take to
the hospital or I'll drive there myself.

84
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:41,860
Madame president, you
know my record of service.

85
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:45,480
If it's acceptable to you, I'm willing to
assume responsibility for your security.

86
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,230
Bill, you're no longer credentialed.
You don't have the authority.

87
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:53,390
Until we capture dubaku and interrogate him, we have
no idea who in the government is working for him.

88
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,560
You do not know who you can trust.

89
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:57,410
But I can trust you.

90
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:00,800
I brought this conspiracy to
your attention, madame president.

91
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:03,590
I would hope that I've earned it.

92
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:05,540
What do you need from me?

93
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:10,180
Reinstate my government clearance, allow
me the authority to vet white house staff,

94
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:15,320
and allow me to bring one of my people into
fbi to provide larry moss with tactical support.

95
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:16,980
Who is it that you want to bring in?

96
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:19,810
Chloe o'brian. I can vouch for
her; she's the best there is.

97
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:23,540
Her clearances were also revoked
when ctu was decommissioned.

98
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:28,130
Isn't there anyone capable of handling these
duties without our having to reinstate her?

99
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:31,100
Someone in the bureau
is on dubaku's payroll.

100
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:34,220
Until we find out who it is, larry moss can't
take the chance of bringing his own people

101
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:36,400
into a manhunt for dubaku.

102
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:38,740
All right.

103
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:42,520
The director of white house secret
service operations is agent hovis.

104
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:45,220
I'll order him to turn over
security protocols to you.

105
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:48,340
I know ted hovis, madame president. He's
not gonna like this; he's gonna fight us.

106
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:52,020
Well, considering that agents under h charge
are responsible for what happened to my husband,

107
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,060
I don't give a damn what he likes.

108
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:58,040
You have your provisional appointment, mr.
Buchanan, under the authority of this office.

109
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,140
Thank you, madame president.

110
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:01,300
You can thank me by
getting me to the hospital.

111
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:03,430
I'll make the arrangements.

112
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:04,230
Madame president...

113
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:07,320
your concerns are clear to me,
ethan, but I've made my decision.

114
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:11,090
I'm only trying to do my job--
looking out for your interests.

115
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,960
My interest right now
is catching ike dubaku.

116
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,650
He has killed scores of americans
today, he tried to kill my husband,

117
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,580
and he has corrupted our government.

118
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:24,080
Whatever it takes, I want
that son of a bitch found.

119
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:31,760
Marika... marika.

120
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:35,500
Samuel, what are you doing here?

121
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:37,380
We need to talk.

122
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,790
Uh, okay, well, I get
a break in 20 minutes.

123
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:43,840
No, now.

124
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:46,150
Okay, what is it? You're scaring me.

125
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,380
Something has come up. I
need to leave the country.

126
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:51,180
What? When?

127
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:53,090
Right away.

128
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,090
I don't understand.
W-when are you coming back?

129
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,490
Marika, listen to me.

130
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,390
I haven't been entirely honest with you.

131
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:02,300
My passport visa expired a couple months
ago and I've been in the country illegally.

132
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:05,460
I'm afraid the immigration
people have caught up with me.

133
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:07,930
It was my sister, wasn't it?

134
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:09,380
She reported you, didn't she?

135
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:10,660
That doesn't matter now.

136
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:14,460
What is important is I have to leave the
country tonight, and I want you to come with me.

137
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,740
Tonight?

138
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,820
Marika, we've talked about this.

139
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:21,060
I promised you that one day i would take you away
from here, give you the happiness that you deserve.

140
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:23,320
Samuel, I-I want that, too, but...

141
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,830
but not tonight, not so soon.

142
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:27,910
Marika, I don't have
time to argue with you!

143
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:33,470
I'm sorry.

144
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,470
I can't leave rosa.

145
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,330
She needs me; I'm the only one she
has to take care of her. You know that.

146
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:42,140
I know, I know. Which is
why she's going to join us.

147
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:42,980
Join us?

148
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,710
As soon as possible.

149
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:47,190
I could only arrange tickets
for both of us tonight,

150
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:51,020
but I want you to promise not to tell
your sister of our plans, at least not yet.

151
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,860
I have to; I can't just run off.

152
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:57,680
No, no, no, she might cause trouble for
us, make it impossible for us to leave.

153
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:05,170
I promise you your sister will join us
within a couple of days of our arrival. Okay?

154
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:07,840
- Our arrival where?
- Belize.

155
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:10,630
I have shown you the
photographs of my home there.

156
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,070
Do you love me?

157
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:18,240
You know I do.

158
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:22,070
Then trust me. Say you'll come.

159
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,840
I'll get my things.

160
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:36,290
I still need to finalize our arrangements.
I want you to go home and pack.

161
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,420
- Wait for my call.
- All right.

162
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:51,750
- Yes.
- It's me.

163
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,620
Have you made the preparations?

164
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:54,790
Almost.

165
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,070
It's been tricky
clearing a flight corridor

166
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,280
since faa still has most private
and commercial aircraft grounded.

167
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,260
I have faith you'll manage.

168
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,150
The arrangements are for two passengers?

169
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,670
Just as you requested.

170
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,710
Are you sure you want
to leave now, colonel?

171
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:10,390
I can't imagine general juma will be pleased
to learn that you're abandoning your mission.

172
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:12,980
The mission is over. I
have done what I can do.

173
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:16,320
If that is not enough for
juma, then to hell with him.

174
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,330
I've got your passports
and itinerary in hand.

175
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:22,000
Meet me at our usual spot in
half an hour. I'll bring them.

176
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:26,760
No, we'll meet in the lobby of
the roosevelt continental hotel.

177
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:29,880
That's not a good idea. It'll
be crowded there at this hour.

178
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:32,460
I know. I want the meeting earlier.

179
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:35,780
I'll see you in 15 minutes.

180
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:40,610
Go.

181
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:46,660
- I can't get it to boot. Hard drive must be fried.
- Damn it.

182
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:49,940
Let's search the bodies. Start with him.

183
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,030
- yeah.
- Renee, it's me.

184
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,130
Bill buchanan just briefed
me on your situation.

185
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:02,560
What's henry taylor's status?

186
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:05,160
They've got him in an ambulance en
route to west arlington hospital.

187
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:06,600
I don't know his current condition.

188
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:08,960
Buchanan told me you and
bauer were in a firefight.

189
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:13,220
Yeah, we took down six of dubaku's men,
but dubaku was gone before we got there.

190
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,480
You all right?

191
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:16,720
I've been in worse.

192
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,140
******

193
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:24,400
- I'm fine, larry.
- Really? I'm not so sure about that.

194
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:26,810
And what is that supposed to mean?

195
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:30,420
I'm looking at a report
faxed to me from metro police.

196
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:34,000
A mrs. Carol vossler is
claiming an unidentified woman

197
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:37,350
held her and her child
hostage at gunpoint.

198
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,390
She says the woman
threatened to kill her son.

199
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,240
Larry, we discussed this.

200
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:43,580
We needed to get vossler to tell
us where taylor was being held.

201
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,020
It was the only leverage we had.

202
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,050
Yeah, right, whatever's necessary.

203
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:50,040
Jack bauer's rationalization for
every unethical action he takes.

204
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,130
It worked, larry. Doesn't
that count for something?

205
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:56,960
Renee, jack bauer is about to be sung up by a senate
subcommittee, and you are following his playbook.

206
00:10:56,970 --> 00:11:01,300
You already got the ag's office looking into that
thing you pulled with tanner's respirator, and now this.

207
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:03,130
No one was actually hurt.

208
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:07,490
No one...? Renee, bauer
killed the woman's husband!

209
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:12,590
Renee, I swear to you, I am
scared of what is happening to you.

210
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:16,360
You put these people through
hell and it doesn't bother you.

211
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:19,230
I didn't say that it doesn't bother
me, larry. I said that it worked.

212
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:23,230
Of course it bothers me.

213
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:27,330
I can see that woman's face.

214
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:30,580
She and her child
staring at me with such...

215
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:34,010
she had no idea that her husband was
a killer, a traitor to his country,

216
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,850
and she looked at me
like I was the monster.

217
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:39,110
- Agent walker.
- Hold on.

218
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:41,570
I cross-referenced the
information on these pdas.

219
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:43,630
I came across some banking transactions.

220
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:46,710
All from a series of accounts
registered to the same address.

221
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,990
- You think it's a safe house?
- It's worth a shot.

222
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,260
Larry, we may have an address on dubaku.

223
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:54,980
21917 euclid street. Apartment six.

224
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:58,360
21917 euclid street, unit
six. We're moving out now.

225
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:00,200
Can you provide sat surveillance?

226
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,240
Yeah, bill buchanan's sending somebody over
to run th, but until she's up and running,

227
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,840
you're gonna have to go in blind.

228
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,840
Okay. We'll be in touch.

229
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:09,490
- You sure you're okay?
- I'm fine.

230
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:11,710
Let's go.

231
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:04,000
Federal investigations continue into the terrorist
acts that have gripped the nation's capital,

232
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:06,430
as well as the people of kidron, ohio.

233
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:11,460
Despite assurances by president taylor in her
national address that the threat has passed

234
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:17,120
Sources at the white house will not confirm that
all those responsible have been accounted for.

235
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:22,290
Now, are you sure you're
not gonna need my help?

236
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,620
I'm just running fbi ops
temporarily until they catch dubaku.

237
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:28,430
Once they find him, hopefully he'll tell us
the names of all the people on his payroll

238
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,460
that are inside our government.

239
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,710
And then, we can go home?

240
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:33,910
Then, we can go home.

241
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:37,620
Well, just be careful. All right?

242
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:41,010
'Cause if buchanan's right and dubaku
has someone working inside the bureau...

243
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:42,490
I'll watch my back.

244
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,620
You just watch prescott.

245
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:53,320
Okay, sweetheart, mommy has to
go to work. You be good, okay?

246
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:55,500
Bye, mommy.

247
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:57,660
- You be good, too.
- I will.

248
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:02,960
And if you get all jammed
up, you know where to find me.

249
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:10,540
I need you to cross-reference
our deployments with homeland.

250
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:12,150
Make sure the requisition
numbers match up.

251
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,870
After that, you can
catch up on the hourlies.

252
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:17,010
Are you joking? That is busy work,
administrative crap you're handing me.

253
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:20,990
Janis... I don't have the time or the inclination
right now to explain my assignments to you.

254
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,130
Just get it done.

255
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:24,810
Agent moss, chloe o'brian just
cleared security. She's on her way up.

256
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,550
All right, thank you.

257
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:29,670
Janis, set up a secure vpn socket.
Port it to the conference room.

258
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,130
Why do you need a vpn socket?

259
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:35,180
I'm bringing in a consultant from homeland to confirm
there are no lingering gaps in the cip firewall.

260
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:37,920
That's fine. Take that downstairs.

261
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:42,040
Ms.O'brian, larry moss.
Welcome to the fbi.

262
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:45,540
- You can call me chloe.
- All right, we're right in here.

263
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,190
Buchanan said you'd be up to speed.

264
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:55,760
- I'm up.
- Good.

265
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:58,560
Agent walker and bauer are
pursuing a potential lead on dubaku.

266
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:03,200
They're en route to this address
in the mount pleasant district.

267
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:05,910
Agent walker's requesting
satellite support.

268
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:09,080
What's the matter? Is something wrong?

269
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:10,880
I'm feeling a little exposed here.

270
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:14,390
If someone out there is working for dubaku,
shouldn't we be doing this more covertly?

271
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:17,320
As far as anyone knows, you're
working on shoring up our firewall.

272
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,470
Besides, this is the only space available
where you'll have full access to our server.

273
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:23,110
Our network doesn't
support remote modules.

274
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:24,310
That's inefficient.

275
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:27,650
Whoever set your network up that
way didn't know what they were doing.

276
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:31,600
I set our network up that way.

277
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:34,790
Okay.

278
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:46,180
Something else?

279
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:48,900
You worked with bauer for
a long time, didn't you?

280
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:52,000
Seven years, on and off.

281
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:54,260
That's impressive.

282
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:57,330
That you survived the experience.

283
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:58,950
What are you talking about?

284
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:00,910
Only that a lot of people didn'T.

285
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:04,570
Curtis manning, ryan
chapelle. His own wife.

286
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:08,240
Are you saying it's jack's
fault his wife was killed?

287
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:10,050
You tell me.

288
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:13,750
Jack bauer is the most trustworthy,
honorable man I know, and he'sy iend.

289
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:18,690
Maybe you should worry less about him and more
about the mole in your office working for dubaku.

290
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:35,000
- Is that chloe o'brian?
- What?

291
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:38,980
In the conference room. Chloe
o'brian-- she was senior analyst at ctu.

292
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:41,440
I once took a seminar she
gave. What's she doing here?

293
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:46,080
Larry said homeland sent her over to check
for residual breaches from the firewall attack.

294
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,530
What?

295
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,520
It just doesn't sound
like her area of expertise.

296
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:54,330
Besides, as far as I know, she's been
inactive since ctu was decommissioned.

297
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:10,610
Your passports and travel itinerary.

298
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:13,720
A hawker-siddley 748 is
fueling at taft airfield.

299
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:16,820
Be ready to fly within a half
hour, get you to the cayman islands.

300
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:18,940
You shouldn't have any trouble
getting to belize from there.

301
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:21,500
I need a car to the
airfield and a driver.

302
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:23,450
I assumed you had your
own transportation.

303
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,310
It's not for me.

304
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:28,000
I see. It's for the girl.

305
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:32,010
Well, I'm not sure I can find
someone I trust on such short notice.

306
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,030
Really?

307
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,160
What about your man at the bar?

308
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:38,080
Excuse me?

309
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:41,000
Or one of the two on the
balcony watching us now?

310
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:44,480
Or the two in the black town
car waiting for me to leave?

311
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:46,860
Do you think I am a fool, mr. Burnett?

312
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:50,130
I know you people see
me as a liability now.

313
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:53,170
These men are here to guarantee your
safety, colonel, not to threaten it.

314
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:57,010
Guarantee my safety. How nice.

315
00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:00,850
And said with such sincerity.

316
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,770
I want you to take this
message back with you.

317
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:10,350
If anything should happen to me
on my way out of the country--

318
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:14,810
an accident or an assassination
attempt, anything--

319
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:18,850
if the plane that you were so
generous to donate decides to explode,

320
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:22,000
a data file with all the names and
bank transactions of all those involved

321
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:24,180
will be sent to the justice department.

322
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,670
That is completely uecessary.

323
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:28,640
The same holds true if anything
should happen to marika donoso.

324
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:30,720
I swear to you, she
knows nothing of this.

325
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,680
She is no threat to you.

326
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:36,120
Make sure your driver knows
this before he brings her to me.

327
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:38,830
Do you understand what I am saying?

328
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:43,690
I want you to tell me that you understand what
I am saying to you, so there will be no mistakes.

329
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:46,290
- I understand.
- Good.

330
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:52,380
The one thing I have learned in the
company of mercenaries, mr. Burnett,

331
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:57,730
is that ultimately, they care about
nothing but their own survival. Good day.

332
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:10,310
I was right.

333
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:12,090
Dubaku suspected we
were gonna take him out,

334
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:15,380
and apparently, he's assembled
evidence to use as an insurance policy.

335
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,740
We need to make sure he gets out of
the country and safely into exile.

336
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:19,640
Otherwise, we're all compromised.

337
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:22,330
I'll make the calls.

338
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:28,490
What are you doing?

339
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,060
Rosa.

340
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,320
Where are you going?

341
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:36,780
Rosa, listen to me. We're
going away from here. All of us.

342
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:40,270
Well, what do you mean, all?

343
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,750
Samuel told me the truth.

344
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,140
He's an illegal, just like you thought.

345
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:49,540
He has to leave the country,
and I've agreed to go with him.

346
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:51,720
You're leaving me?

347
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:55,330
No, no, only for a short
time. You're gonna come, too.

348
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:58,540
Samuel's made plans. We're gonna
live with him in his home in belize.

349
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:02,330
Marika... he's lying to you.

350
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,710
- He's not.
- I won't let you do this!

351
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,430
My god, rosa.

352
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:09,200
I have taken care of you my entire life.

353
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:11,600
I've sacrificed everything for you.

354
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,050
Why can't you let me have this?

355
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:14,250
I don't trust him.

356
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:17,910
Oh, well, you never liked any man
who's ever shown an interest in me.

357
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:21,840
Every chance I've ever had at happiness, you
found some way of ruining it. But not this time.

358
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:23,900
- Marika, I'm begging you, listen to me.
- No.

359
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:25,980
Marika, please. Stop.

360
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:27,230
Move!

361
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:30,840
Marika, please. Listen to
me. I'm begging you, marik...

362
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:32,100
fbi--
don't move!

363
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:34,520
Get on your knees now! On your knees!

364
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:38,480
Both of you, put your hands behind
your head, interlock your fingers. Now!

365
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:40,820
Do not move.

366
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,250
We're clear.

367
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:47,190
- Where is dubaku?
- Who?

368
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,220
Don't play games with me!

369
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:50,810
Ike dubaku-- we traced bank
accounts to this address.

370
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:52,370
Now, where is he?

371
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:54,820
We don't know who you're talking about.

372
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:56,720
Let me make try and
make this easier for you.

373
00:20:56,770 --> 00:20:59,500
You know this man?

374
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:02,530
No.

375
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:05,670
You're lying to me.
Why are you lying to me?

376
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:08,390
Let me see.

377
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,520
That's him--
we know him.

378
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,700
- He calls himself aboa, samuel aboa.
- Rosa, shut up!

379
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:17,130
She was going to meet him to leave me.

380
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:19,500
Where were you gonna meet
him? Where were you going?

381
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:20,950
I don't know.

382
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:23,020
- How do you know him? You work for him?
- No.

383
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:25,080
- Do you work for him?
- No.

384
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:31,430
You know what he's doing
here in this country?

385
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:37,730
Do you have any idea...
what this man is?

386
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:41,380
He's everything to me.

387
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,860
- Nurse...
- Mitchell.

388
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:14,570
Nurse mitchell,I'd
like to see my husband.

389
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:16,670
Uh,ma'am,I...I don't
know if that's possible.

390
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:19,020
I was told that dr. Schulman
will be doing the surgery.

391
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:19,940
Where is he?

392
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:22,110
Excuse me,madame president.

393
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:24,600
I'm lee schulman,your husband's surgeon.

394
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,360
If you come with me,you can see him
now,but you'll need to keep it brief.

395
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:28,800
Thank you.

396
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:33,020
You should know that mr. Taylor's looking
at a minimum of five hours in surgery.

397
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:36,820
The bullet lacerated his pulmonary
artery and lodged in his thoracic region.

398
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:39,720
He's also suffered
massive internal bleeding.

399
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:42,740
Can you offer any kind of prognosis?

400
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:44,810
I'm a blunt woman,dr. Schulman.

401
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:47,080
I appreciates bluntness.

402
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:49,250
His chances aren't good,ma'am.

403
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:51,500
But I'll do everything I can.

404
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:55,010
If you'll excuse me.
I need to scrub up now.

405
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:03,480
Henry?

406
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:05,320
Darling,can you hear me?

407
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:06,290
Ally.

408
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:09,070
Yes,sweetheart.

409
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:11,010
I'm here.

410
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:13,570
I'm so sorry I didn't
listen to you about roger.

411
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,870
You were right.

412
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:16,620
It wasn't suicide.

413
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:19,960
I know that now. You were always right.

414
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,530
He was a hero.

415
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:22,480
Yes.

416
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:26,130
He was,and so are you.

417
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:31,080
I'm sorry,madame president,but
the anesthesiologist is ready now.

418
00:23:56,970 --> 00:23:58,950
Mr. Buchanan?

419
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:01,780
Yes,madame president?

420
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:05,090
Ere's something I need you to do for me.

421
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:10,060
Have someone find my daughter
olivia and bring her to me.

422
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:12,970
Have you had a chance to tell her?

423
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:18,270
My daughter and I haven't spoken
for some time,mr. Buchanan.

424
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:21,340
She'd never get on the phone with me.

425
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,990
She works for a consulting
firm-- martling/norris.

426
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:31,900
Do have someone
trustworthy you can send?

427
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:33,930
Yes,ma'am.

428
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,150
I believe I do.

429
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:50,010
And here he is again in the uniform of the presidential
guard at the gates of the notorious mukatu prison.

430
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:54,260
And here,inside the soccer
stadium after the barakar massacre.

431
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:57,210
The event that earned him the
nickname the butcher of sangala.

432
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,720
Oh,please. No more.

433
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:06,100
what did you say his
real name was again?

434
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:07,690
Dubaku.

435
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:11,640
Ike dubaku.

436
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:16,000
I've seen firsthand
what he's capable of.

437
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:17,310
I was in africa a few months ago.

438
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:20,360
He was responsible for
murdering a friend of mine.

439
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:24,280
I know this is a shock.

440
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:26,300
and I'm sorry.

441
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,290
I really am.But here's the situation.

442
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,920
We need your help,and we need it now.

443
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,240
what kind of help?

444
00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:36,060
We need to put this man in custody
before he can leave the country.

445
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:36,990
Well,she already told you.

446
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:38,590
She doesn't know where he is.

447
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:41,060
Yeah,but you said earlier that
you were going to meet him.

448
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,420
Where?

449
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:43,790
He didn't say.

450
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:48,600
Just told me to go home and
pack and wait for his call.

451
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:50,670
Give me your phone.

452
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:53,870
Why?

453
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:55,860
When he calls,I want you to answer it.

454
00:25:55,890 --> 00:25:57,550
No. No,no. I can'T. I can'T.

455
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:59,340
Yes,you can.

456
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:02,740
listen to me.
Just...just-just listen to me.

457
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:04,640
It's-it's over.

458
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:10,700
The man you thought you knew,the man
you had feelings for-- he doesn't exist.

459
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:15,020
All you've been left with
are his lies and his betrayal.

460
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:18,470
is that him?

461
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:21,970
Marika,please.

462
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,080
All I want you to do is answer
the phone and talk to him

463
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,220
so that we can find out
where he wants to meet you.

464
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:29,660
Please. You can do this.

465
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:31,750
Please just try.

466
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:40,480
hello.

467
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:41,150
Marika?

468
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:42,320
Yes.

469
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:43,190
Are you all right?

470
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:44,520
I'm fine.

471
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:46,890
What took you so long
to answer the phone?

472
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,810
I was in the bedroom packing.

473
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,090
Where are you?

474
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,150
What's wrong?

475
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,640
You sound strange.

476
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:54,340
It'S...it was rosa.

477
00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:57,690
She caught me packing,and we argued.

478
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,650
Is she going to be a problem for us?

479
00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:00,330
No.

480
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,220
I'm sorry,samuel.

481
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:03,160
I had to tell her everything.

482
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,400
It was the only way.

483
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:07,030
But,uh...but she understands now.

484
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:08,420
Are you certain?

485
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:10,480
Yeah. Yeah,she's fine.

486
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:14,380
Now that she knows she and I will
be together again in a few days.

487
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:18,520
She should thank heaven she
has such an angel for a sister.

488
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:19,880
Are you ready to go?

489
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:20,830
Almost.

490
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:21,660
Hurry up then.

491
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:23,090
I've had a car sent for you.

492
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:24,490
It should be there very shortly.

493
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:26,940
Go downstairs and wait for it.

494
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:28,130
Where is it taking me?

495
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:30,360
Don't worry. The driver will know.

496
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:35,680
I just want the woman I love to
get downstairs as quickly possible.

497
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,290
Okay.

498
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:43,970
It's all right. It's all right.

499
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:44,920
You did great.

500
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:46,500
Did we get the rendezvous point?

501
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:49,180
No. He's sending a car with a driver.

502
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,870
Come here.

503
00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:00,210
there's no one on the street yet.

504
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,630
We could grab the driver,get
him to tell us dubaku's location.

505
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,280
There's no guarantee
we can get him to talk.

506
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:06,650
And if we take too long,dubaku's
not gonna wait around.

507
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,690
So then what do we do?

508
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:15,180
We can get her to go meet with him.

509
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:15,870
What?

510
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:19,170
We could track her. We could use
her cell phone as a transponder.

511
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:20,900
You want to send that girl to dubaku?

512
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:22,250
We don't have another choice.

513
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:22,850
Jack.

514
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,770
You want to get dubaku,this is our shot.

515
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:33,550
Marika?

516
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:38,440
I have a favor to ask of you.

517
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:40,820
We can't make you do this.

518
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:43,110
But when the car arrives,we would
like you to go with the driver

519
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,030
so that we could follow
you back to dubaku.

520
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:46,380
Oh,what-what are you talking about?

521
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:48,500
You want her to go to him and face him?

522
00:28:48,530 --> 00:28:51,610
It's the only chance we have of finding
him before he disappears forever.

523
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,140
I'll do it.

524
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:55,960
- I'll do it.
- No!

525
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:59,530
I'm your older sister,and
I won't allow it.

526
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:01,440
It's not your decision to make,rosa.

527
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:03,700
It's mine.

528
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:08,370
And it's the right thing to do.

529
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:10,940
Let me see your phone.

530
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:15,370
What are you doing?

531
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:16,700
Getting your sid number.

532
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:18,510
It's how we're going to track you.

533
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:20,130
You're not gonna be out there alone.

534
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:21,500
Agent walker and i
will be following you.

535
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:23,150
We'll never be more than a mile behind.

536
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:27,200
As soon as you reach the destination--
that's when we'll move in.

537
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:28,210
Marika.

538
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,250
A mile!

539
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:30,330
Are you crazy?

540
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:32,310
Rosa,enough.

541
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:33,410
You heard what he said.

542
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:35,410
He's a murderer! He could hurt you.

543
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,290
He won'T.

544
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:40,260
Rosa,I should have listened to you.

545
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,220
Sweetheart.

546
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,880
You warned me about him.

547
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:48,550
Listen,the only reason why I said
those things was because I was jealous.

548
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:51,350
And I didn't want to lose you.

549
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:54,540
Larry,it's jack.

550
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,540
Renee said you had someone
running operations support?

551
00:29:56,570 --> 00:29:59,380
Yeah. She's right here.
I'll put you on speaker.

552
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:02,010
jack,it's chloe.

553
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:02,770
Chloe.

554
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,650
What do you need?

555
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:06,220
How long's it gonna take you to set
up a sat beacon for a mobile line?

556
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,070
Usually a few seconds,but with the
backward way they have the system set up,

557
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:10,680
it's gonna take at least a few minutes.

558
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,720
Okay,well,let me give
you the sid number.

559
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:16,840
1-c-4-8-6-8-9.

560
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:17,730
You got it?

561
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,570
Got it.

562
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:20,180
Jack,who are you tracking?

563
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:22,240
A woman who's involved with dubaku.

564
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:23,950
He's sending a car to take her to him.

565
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:25,980
She's one of his operatives?

566
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:29,260
No. It's-it's more
complicated than that.

567
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:07,300
Arthur,you're not going
to find another firm

568
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:12,090
that's done more high-level consulting work  for a
relatively small pharmaceutical company like yours.

569
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:18,260
Remember,my firm helped the governor craft a plan to swap
property taxes for sales taxes in his last budget reform.

570
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:20,150
Tell me that didn't save
dexter-carr a bundle.

571
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:22,050
Oh,it did,olivia.

572
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:26,260
But since I'm specifically looking to hire
you,I need to know what you yourself can do.

573
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:27,700
Whatever you need.

574
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:30,580
You know my accomplishments,you've
seen my resume.

575
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,120
I mean white house influence.

576
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:35,420
Considering your family.

577
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,270
We're not lobbyists,arthur.

578
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:39,760
It states that clearly in the contract.

579
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:41,760
I just thought,since you
had the president's ear...

580
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:43,380
I don'T.

581
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:44,980
Is that going to be a problem?

582
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:47,150
Excuse me,ms.Taylor?

583
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:49,960
Do I know you?

584
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:52,130
My name is aaron pierce.

585
00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:53,970
Your office told me you'd be here.

586
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:57,310
I've been dispatched at
the request the president.

587
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:59,880
Your credentials say
you've retired,mr. Pierce.

588
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:03,120
Perhaps no one informed you I refused
secret service protection months ago.

589
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:04,190
I'm aware of that,ma'am.

590
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:06,640
This ia special circumstance.

591
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:09,670
Well,as you can see,I'm
a little busy right now.

592
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:10,580
This isn't a good time.

593
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:12,500
I'm sorry,but I have to insist.

594
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:13,720
It's really...it's all right.

595
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:17,990
No. No,it's not all right.

596
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,040
What is it that's so important for my mother to
steal me away while I'm trying to do business?

597
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:23,880
I'm not at liberty to say,ma'am.

598
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,980
That informationis confidential.

599
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:28,000
Olivia,we can pick
this up at a later time.

600
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,220
Arthur,wait...

601
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:30,940
we'll be in touch.

602
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:37,040
Ma'am,please?

603
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:41,110
I'm not going anywhere with you
until you tell me what this is about.

604
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:44,400
It's your father,ms.Taylor.

605
00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:46,460
He's been shot.

606
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:49,380
He's in surgery at
west arlington hospital.

607
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:50,980
Your mother's there now.

608
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:54,530
None of this is public knowledge.

609
00:32:55,990 --> 00:32:57,770
My god,I...

610
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,240
my car is just outside.

611
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,400
Excuse me,sean.

612
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:11,770
Can I please get the digital
beta key for the server?

613
00:33:11,810 --> 00:33:13,160
Why?

614
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:14,390
Larry asked for it.

615
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:16,710
Something to do with
the firewall assessment.

616
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:18,620
If larry wants it,why
doesn't he come to me?

617
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:19,950
I don't know.

618
00:33:22,050 --> 00:33:23,210
Maybe I ought to go ask him.

619
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:24,710
No.

620
00:33:25,890 --> 00:33:27,210
Okay.

621
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:31,050
I think that larry brought in this
woman,chloe o'brian,to replace me.

622
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,810
And I just want to get a bead
on what they're working on.

623
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:34,060
That's all.

624
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:37,690
That's all? That's enough
toose us both our jobs.

625
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:40,500
Well,maybe I should
stop covering for you.

626
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:42,000
What are you talking about?

627
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,810
Erika and you,and your
little sexual indiscretions.

628
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:47,490
I've said nothing to larry or your wife.

629
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:50,370
I'm sure you'd like
me to keep it that way.

630
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,790
You're a little bitch,you know that?

631
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:17,950
You're a little bitch.

632
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,410
Okay,jack. The link's
up,I've got the signal.

633
00:34:27,450 --> 00:34:29,750
Copy that. I'll get back to you.

634
00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:32,460
We're on.

635
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:39,840
Marika...

636
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,760
we got to go.

637
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:55,570
You--
fbi.

638
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:58,670
You keep her safe,you hear me?

639
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,110
We will.

640
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:10,980
I'm really scared.

641
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:11,840
You're going to be fine.

642
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:13,780
Just remember,we're right behind you.

643
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,470
Move up here.

644
00:35:16,850 --> 00:35:19,900
Now,listen,if you get into trouble,you
can signal us by dialing one-zero...

645
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,850
no. No,I don't want you to do that.

646
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:24,700
Don't do anything that's going to
raise the suspicion of the driver.

647
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,650
Okay.

648
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:27,200
You ready?

649
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:28,090
I'm ready.

650
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:29,900
Yeah.

651
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:40,750
What the hell are you doing?

652
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,470
She was scared.

653
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:45,400
I wanted her to know there was another
option than waiting for us to swoop in.

654
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:49,140
If we're going to find dubaku,there
are no other options,you understand?

655
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,900
Come on,you've run operations like this.

656
00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:53,490
Not without full tactical support,and
at least two backup units on the scene.

657
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,520
She's naked out there,jack.

658
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,380
I don't like it.

659
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:57,210
This isn't about you.

660
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,550
This is about her and dubaku.

661
00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:04,100
Listen,life gets ugly,innocent
people get hurt-- that's a reality.

662
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:07,150
At least she got to make a choice
to be involved,to do the right thing.

663
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:09,420
Which is a lot more than I can
say for dubaku's other victims.

664
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:12,250
We have one job here--
that's to get dubaku.

665
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:15,330
Outside of that don't get involved.

666
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:19,680
Chloe,the car's here.

667
00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:21,120
Copy that.

668
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:29,440
She's getting in the car.

669
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:30,970
Copy.

670
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:40,090
She's moving. Are you cked in?

671
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:43,370
Yeah,I've got them
heading south on 14th.

672
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:46,600
Can you upload the tracking
grid to agent walker's pda?

673
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,710
No,I'll have to direct you.

674
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:49,690
Just keep us close.

675
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:52,070
Understood. Head towards
14th,make a right.

676
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,710
Copy that.

677
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:43,310
How much further?

678
00:37:54,610 --> 00:37:57,270
Continuing west on r
street,crossing hampshire avenue.

679
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:59,360
You're less than a mile
behind the target car.

680
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:00,760
Copy that.

681
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:05,130
Target car is turning,left
on connecticut.

682
00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:07,220
Okay,rounding dupont circle.

683
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,510
Agent moss,is there anything
in the northern quad of the grid

684
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:12,520
that would indicate where dubaku
can hide a plane or a helicopter?

685
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,880
No. Nothing definitive.

686
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:16,120
Could be any number of launch sites.

687
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,210
Whoa! Whoa! What was it?

688
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:21,120
What happened?

689
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:24,150
Jack,we've got a problem.

690
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:25,740
Chloe,what's wrong?

691
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,660
- We just lost the tracking grid.
- What?

692
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,420
I-I don't know. It just
suddenly glitched out.

693
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:30,280
We can't afford to lose them.

694
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:32,180
Jack,I gave this woman
my word we'd protect her.

695
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:32,730
I know.

696
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:33,960
Chloe,get it back up.

697
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:36,340
We're doing our best,here,jack.

698
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,090
Wait.

699
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,420
It's back up.

700
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,520
What the hell happened?

701
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:42,860
I don't know,I'm running
a diagnostic right now.

702
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:45,480
Jack,they're moving southeast
on massachusetts avenue.

703
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:46,730
You've closed the gap
to about a half mile.

704
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:48,100
You may want to back off a little bit.

705
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:49,970
Okay,copy that.

706
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:51,040
Oh,no.

707
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:51,950
What?

708
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:54,230
Somebody was in the system.

709
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:55,090
What? What are you talking about?

710
00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:57,980
I'm saying someone in this
office was mirroring my terminal.

711
00:38:58,010 --> 00:39:01,210
Whoever it was knows
exactly what we were doing.

712
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:10,080
Can you backtrace the breach?

713
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:10,860
No.

714
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:11,920
The link was severed.

715
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:14,440
It could have come from anywhere.

716
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:20,270
Jack,you getting this?

717
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:21,790
It looks like we might
have a security breach.

718
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:23,790
Someone is mirroring our comm.

719
00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:26,750
Jack,they're coming from all sides.

720
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:28,870
Larry,we got a situation here.

721
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:29,620
what's going on?

722
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:32,560
I got metro pds Trying to
build a roadblock around us.

723
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:33,830
What?

724
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:35,470
Why would they be doing that?

725
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:38,000
I don't know. Just get 'em off us!

726
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,550
larry,do something!

727
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:52,290
This is agent moss.

728
00:39:52,330 --> 00:39:54,130
Connect me with metro district command.

729
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:55,530
Hands in the air! Hands in the air!

730
00:39:55,570 --> 00:39:56,750
My name is jack bauer

731
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:58,430
Get out of the car right now!

732
00:39:58,490 --> 00:39:59,690
my passenger is a federal agent.

733
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:01,810
Get out of the car right now!

734
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:04,340
She's a federal agent!

735
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:08,200
Put your hands behind your back,sir.

736
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:11,670
Come on,larry,do something!

737
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,480
Captain,you've got to release
these people immediately!

738
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,780
No. No,that is a mistake.

739
00:40:15,810 --> 00:40:18,400
No federal warrants have
been issued for them!

740
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:19,400
Yes,they have.

741
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,720
A warrant was called in for the vehicle.

742
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:24,290
"Occupants armed and dangerous,to
be apprehended with decisive force."

743
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:25,090
Issued by whom?

744
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,300
Fbi. This office.

745
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:28,150
There's no attribution,but
the routing code's real.

746
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:31,060
This was definitely
done by someone here.

747
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:34,150
Marika's car just turned
east onto n street.

748
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:35,450
Captain,listen carefully.

749
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:40,070
I'm the special agent in charge of this operation,and
I am revoking these warrants immediately.

750
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:43,380
No. No,I don't have time to
deal with your chain of command.

751
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:46,400
You need to release
these people right now!

752
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:51,220
Thank you.

753
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,990
So is o'brian here to replace you?

754
00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:53,600
I don't know.

755
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:54,530
No.

756
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:58,020
Larry's using her for some kind of
covert operation with jack bauer.

757
00:40:58,050 --> 00:41:00,060
They're tracking a car to dubaku.

758
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:02,070
Why would he keep us in the
dark about something like that?

759
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:02,930
I don't know.

760
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,360
I don't know,but I don't like it.

761
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,220
Hey,I took care of bauer and walker.

762
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:20,510
They're pinned down.

763
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:23,070
Why am I being brought
in on this so last minute?

764
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:25,380
Moss is running this op on his own.

765
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:29,140
It took me some time to
tap into his phone line.

766
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,170
He's on with metro right now.

767
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:34,100
Can you at least disable the tracking
signal they're using to follow the girl?

768
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:35,390
No,not from my console.

769
00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:38,620
But judging by the frequency,they're
using her cell as the tracker.

770
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:39,730
All right.

771
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:41,250
Good work.

772
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:45,690
You told me that once dubaku served
his purpose,you'd take him out.

773
00:41:45,730 --> 00:41:47,300
Why are we still helping him?

774
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:52,530
He's threatening to expose us using the database he's
kept with names and accounts of everyone involved.

775
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:55,280
Including mine?

776
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:56,510
I mean,everyone.

777
00:41:56,530 --> 00:41:59,930
We don't know where the file is,so
you just better pray that he gets away.

778
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:14,350
Yes,it has to do with the terrorist
threats that happened this morning.

779
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:27,370
hello?

780
00:42:27,410 --> 00:42:28,660
You got a problem.

781
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:29,580
What is it?

782
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:32,210
Your girlfriend's
been turned by the fbi.

783
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,570
I don't believe you.

784
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:37,100
They met with her a half hour
ago,told her who you really are.

785
00:42:37,150 --> 00:42:38,340
That's impossible.

786
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:39,350
Marika would never do this.

787
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:42,530
I got it from our source inside
the bureau,it is definite.

788
00:42:42,570 --> 00:42:45,970
She agreed to lead them to you,using
her cell phone as a tracker.

789
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,540
Look,my source managed to stall
their surveillance team for a while,

790
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:51,420
but you need to get to
the airfield immediately.

791
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,610
I'll call my driver,have
him take care of her.

792
00:42:53,650 --> 00:42:54,350
No.

793
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:55,470
I'll do it.

794
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:58,020
Colonel,I told you,they
are tracking her.

795
00:42:58,050 --> 00:43:00,930
If you let her come to you,you're
risking your chances of escape.

796
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:04,340
I said,I'll take care of her!
