1
00:00:13,723 --> 00:00:16,492
I don't want to see either
one of you ever again.

2
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:18,026
Do we have a deal or not?

3
00:00:18,094 --> 00:00:20,896
<i>Yeah, we got a deal.</i>

4
00:00:22,198 --> 00:00:23,132
I'm going after him.

5
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:24,133
We're done.

6
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,667
We're just getting started.

7
00:00:25,735 --> 00:00:28,437
(grunts in pain)

8
00:00:28,505 --> 00:00:29,772
Jenny!

9
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:32,107
(gunshots)

10
00:00:32,175 --> 00:00:33,175
(groans)

11
00:00:34,577 --> 00:00:37,179
We need to talk about
you having Tarin arrested.

12
00:00:37,247 --> 00:00:39,348
I know you consider
Tarin a friend.

13
00:00:39,416 --> 00:00:40,816
We are more than friends.

14
00:00:40,884 --> 00:00:43,118
<i>We're in love.</i>

15
00:00:43,186 --> 00:00:46,255
You've been carrying
on with this man...

16
00:00:46,322 --> 00:00:47,790
behind my back?

17
00:00:47,857 --> 00:00:49,792
Who are these men, Samir?

18
00:00:49,859 --> 00:00:51,026
These are men I
have recruited.

19
00:00:51,094 --> 00:00:53,195
We can't get the rods
out of the country,

20
00:00:53,263 --> 00:00:55,330
so let's use them as
a radiological bomb.

21
00:00:55,398 --> 00:00:58,834
<i>Then we'll show the
Americans how strong we are.</i>

22
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:01,703
(grunts)

23
00:01:01,771 --> 00:01:03,071
(groans)

24
00:01:03,139 --> 00:01:04,072
Samir!

25
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:05,274
Over here!

26
00:01:06,342 --> 00:01:07,543
There are people chasing me.

27
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:09,077
They have the rods
you are looking for.

28
00:01:09,145 --> 00:01:10,345
I thought you had the rods.

29
00:01:10,413 --> 00:01:12,381
They turned against me.

30
00:01:12,449 --> 00:01:13,649
Just get me out of here.

31
00:01:13,716 --> 00:01:15,017
We'll get you out, Mr. Hassan.

32
00:01:15,084 --> 00:01:16,485
MAN: When things get
this colossally screwed up

33
00:01:16,553 --> 00:01:18,754
people look for
someone to blame.

34
00:01:18,822 --> 00:01:20,689
<i>HASTINGS: So what
have you got in mind?</i>

35
00:01:20,757 --> 00:01:22,691
Renee Walker- she killed
one of our main leads.

36
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:24,359
You're talking about a
woman who put her life

37
00:01:24,427 --> 00:01:25,861
on the line when
she didn't have to.

38
00:01:25,929 --> 00:01:27,529
Well, someone has to
pay for this, Brian.

39
00:01:27,597 --> 00:01:30,332
I'm sending someone over
from Justice- Kristin Smith.

40
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,967
She'll take care
of everything.

41
00:01:32,035 --> 00:01:35,337
They're setting you up-
don't say another word.

42
00:01:35,405 --> 00:01:37,239
It's too late.

43
00:01:37,307 --> 00:01:39,174
This is over.
We're leaving now.

44
00:01:39,242 --> 00:01:40,175
Hands in the air.

45
00:01:40,243 --> 00:01:41,477
Do it now!

46
00:01:41,544 --> 00:01:43,312
<i>HASTINGS: You offering</i>

47
00:01:43,379 --> 00:01:44,913
to bring in Farhad? Yes.

48
00:01:44,981 --> 00:01:48,350
If you drop the criminal
investigation against Renee Walker.

49
00:01:48,418 --> 00:01:51,553
If we do this, Jack, it's
not for one rescue operation,

50
00:01:51,621 --> 00:01:53,021
it's till this whole thing

51
00:01:53,089 --> 00:01:55,090
is over and done.

52
00:01:56,426 --> 00:01:57,793
Deal.

53
00:02:11,808 --> 00:02:13,909
We're about to transport
him to the embassy.

54
00:02:13,977 --> 00:02:15,577
You have two minutes.

55
00:02:15,645 --> 00:02:17,112
Thank you.

56
00:02:21,684 --> 00:02:24,219
Bashir, clear the room.

57
00:02:24,287 --> 00:02:26,889
Tarin, did they hurt you?

58
00:02:26,956 --> 00:02:28,390
Not yet.

59
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:30,726
They won't until they
get me to our embassy.

60
00:02:30,793 --> 00:02:32,494
I tried to reason
with my father,

61
00:02:32,562 --> 00:02:33,962
but he wouldn't listen.

62
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:37,399
He thinks you're involved in
the conspiracy with his brother.

63
00:02:37,467 --> 00:02:40,869
Even after I told him about
us, he doesn't trust you.

64
00:02:40,937 --> 00:02:42,437
You told him about us?

65
00:02:42,505 --> 00:02:44,540
I hoped it would
change his mind.

66
00:02:44,607 --> 00:02:48,043
But if anything, it's made
things worse between us.

67
00:02:49,512 --> 00:02:51,513
(whispers): Come closer.

68
00:02:56,119 --> 00:02:58,053
Listen to me, Kayla,

69
00:02:58,121 --> 00:02:59,488
there is a way out of this.

70
00:02:59,556 --> 00:03:02,391
There are a few men still loyal
to me- Bashir is one of them.

71
00:03:02,458 --> 00:03:05,594
He's agreed to help me escape.

72
00:03:05,662 --> 00:03:07,829
As soon as he's able, Bashir
will slip me a handcuff key,

73
00:03:07,897 --> 00:03:10,065
and he's placed a gun in
the car for me to find.

74
00:03:10,133 --> 00:03:11,099
You won't hurt anyone?

75
00:03:11,167 --> 00:03:13,035
The gun is so I won't have to.

76
00:03:13,102 --> 00:03:15,337
Once I'm free, I
have a place to stay

77
00:03:15,405 --> 00:03:16,872
until the Americans
grant me asylum.

78
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:20,342
Kayla... I want
you to come with me.

79
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:23,278
Meet me at the Teodore Hotel.

80
00:03:23,346 --> 00:03:25,280
Promise me you'll come.

81
00:03:25,348 --> 00:03:26,448
(door opens)

82
00:03:26,516 --> 00:03:28,517
Tarin, we need to go.

83
00:03:32,822 --> 00:03:34,823
(handcuffs rattling)

84
00:03:42,865 --> 00:03:45,000
(crickets chirping)

85
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:47,803
(grunting)

86
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:50,706
Cole, he's dead!

87
00:03:50,773 --> 00:03:52,274
Just go.

88
00:03:52,342 --> 00:03:54,343
(panting): What?

89
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:55,644
Just go.

90
00:03:55,712 --> 00:03:58,313
Nobody knows you had
anything to do with this.

91
00:03:58,381 --> 00:03:59,848
It's my fault.

92
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:01,383
I lied about everything.

93
00:04:01,451 --> 00:04:04,019
Who I am, what I've done.

94
00:04:04,087 --> 00:04:06,688
I'll call the police.

95
00:04:06,756 --> 00:04:09,858
I deserve to take
the blame for this.

96
00:04:09,926 --> 00:04:12,928
(panting)

97
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,267
What's done is done.

98
00:04:19,335 --> 00:04:20,736
We're cleaning this up,

99
00:04:20,803 --> 00:04:22,704
and no one's ever gonna
know what happened.

100
00:04:22,772 --> 00:04:24,272
I don't want you involved.

101
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,707
I'm already involved.

102
00:04:25,775 --> 00:04:29,745
We're gonna strip down his
van so it can't be I.D.'d.

103
00:04:29,812 --> 00:04:32,314
We'll dump the
bodies in the swamp.

104
00:04:32,382 --> 00:04:35,417
Hey. Hey!

105
00:04:35,485 --> 00:04:38,520
They're scum, Dana, and
no one's gonna miss 'em.

106
00:04:38,588 --> 00:04:41,857
You want to go to prison for
the rest of your life? For them?!

107
00:04:41,924 --> 00:04:43,492
Get started on the van.

108
00:04:43,559 --> 00:04:45,794
I'll go get the other one.

109
00:04:45,862 --> 00:04:47,863
(sniffling)

110
00:04:50,967 --> 00:04:52,901
PATTY (over intercom): Mr. Hastings,
the president's on the line.

111
00:04:52,969 --> 00:04:55,203
Thank you. This is Hastings.

112
00:04:55,271 --> 00:04:56,938
Mr. Hastings, I'm
here with Rob Weiss.

113
00:04:57,006 --> 00:04:58,640
I was told you
have urgent news.

114
00:04:58,708 --> 00:04:59,741
Yes, ma'am.

115
00:04:59,809 --> 00:05:01,877
We received a call
from Farhad Hassan.

116
00:05:01,944 --> 00:05:02,944
Farhad?

117
00:05:03,012 --> 00:05:04,613
Yes. As we suspected,
he was trying

118
00:05:04,681 --> 00:05:07,282
to smuggle the nuclear
rods out of the country.

119
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:10,085
The people he's working
with have turned against him.

120
00:05:10,153 --> 00:05:12,421
What do we know?
Well, Farhad believes

121
00:05:12,488 --> 00:05:14,956
they want to use the rods
to construct a dirty bomb

122
00:05:15,024 --> 00:05:17,159
and set it off somewhere
here in New York City.

123
00:05:17,226 --> 00:05:19,161
Why would they do this?

124
00:05:19,228 --> 00:05:21,229
Between Hassan's
crackdowns and CTU,

125
00:05:21,297 --> 00:05:23,065
we've backed them
into a corner.

126
00:05:23,132 --> 00:05:24,733
This is their response.

127
00:05:24,801 --> 00:05:26,068
Do you believe him?

128
00:05:26,135 --> 00:05:27,335
Yes, I do.

129
00:05:27,403 --> 00:05:28,870
Farhad is turning himself in.

130
00:05:28,938 --> 00:05:31,273
He's agreed to help
us prevent this attack.

131
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:32,474
Where is Farhad now?

132
00:05:32,542 --> 00:05:33,608
He's in a warehouse

133
00:05:33,676 --> 00:05:35,577
just outside the city
near Forest Hills.

134
00:05:35,645 --> 00:05:38,113
I've enlisted Jack
Bauer to lock him down.

135
00:05:38,181 --> 00:05:39,181
Now, Madam President,

136
00:05:39,248 --> 00:05:40,949
the men who turned
against Farhad

137
00:05:41,017 --> 00:05:43,151
are covert assets
for the I.R.K.

138
00:05:43,219 --> 00:05:44,820
Now, if we can get access

139
00:05:44,887 --> 00:05:46,955
to the I.R.K.
intelligence files,

140
00:05:47,023 --> 00:05:49,791
Farhad may be able to
help us I.D. these men.

141
00:05:49,859 --> 00:05:51,560
It will put us
that much closer

142
00:05:51,627 --> 00:05:54,663
to tracking them down. Those
files are the lifeblood of Hassan's

143
00:05:54,731 --> 00:05:56,665
intelligence operation-
he'll never hand them over.

144
00:05:56,733 --> 00:05:58,633
Especially in his
current frame of mind.

145
00:05:58,701 --> 00:06:00,168
Hell, the man's gone
off the deep end.

146
00:06:00,236 --> 00:06:02,771
Well, maybe this will
pull him out of it.

147
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:03,939
Tell Hassan we have

148
00:06:04,006 --> 00:06:06,007
found his brother and
I need to speak to him

149
00:06:06,075 --> 00:06:07,008
immediately.

150
00:06:07,076 --> 00:06:08,009
And contact

151
00:06:08,077 --> 00:06:09,411
Tim Woods at Homeland.

152
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:10,746
Have him put
together a briefing.

153
00:06:10,813 --> 00:06:12,781
I need to know exactly
what we're facing

154
00:06:12,849 --> 00:06:15,484
if, God forbid,
this attack happens.

155
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:17,018
Thank you, Mr. Hastings.

156
00:06:17,086 --> 00:06:18,520
I'll be in the
counsel chamber.

157
00:06:18,588 --> 00:06:20,422
Yes, Madam President.

158
00:06:21,758 --> 00:06:23,859
<i>HASTINGS (over
intercom): Mr. Weiss.</i>

159
00:06:23,926 --> 00:06:24,960
Yeah?

160
00:06:25,027 --> 00:06:25,994
<i>Are we alone?</i>

161
00:06:26,062 --> 00:06:27,095
Yeah. What is it?

162
00:06:28,431 --> 00:06:31,633
I want to let you
know that I've decided

163
00:06:31,701 --> 00:06:33,969
not to pursue charges
against Renee Walker.

164
00:06:34,036 --> 00:06:35,170
What?

165
00:06:35,238 --> 00:06:37,172
Why not? I told you...

166
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,907
We have a lot
more to worry about

167
00:06:38,975 --> 00:06:40,142
right now than blaming Walker.

168
00:06:40,209 --> 00:06:41,610
Walker murdered
a valuable lead

169
00:06:41,677 --> 00:06:43,979
that might have gotten
us to those nuclear rods.

170
00:06:44,046 --> 00:06:45,480
You're not hearing me.

171
00:06:45,548 --> 00:06:48,083
We have a new lead
now- Farhad Hassan-

172
00:06:48,151 --> 00:06:50,318
and that is what
I am pursuing.

173
00:06:50,386 --> 00:06:53,989
You want to replace me as
head of CTU, be my guest.

174
00:06:54,056 --> 00:06:55,724
But until you do,

175
00:06:55,792 --> 00:06:57,692
stay the hell out of my way.

176
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,494
- Hastings, you're making...
- I'll let you know

177
00:06:59,562 --> 00:07:01,229
when Bauer reaches Farhad.

178
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,501
(sighs)

179
00:07:12,275 --> 00:07:16,478
Okay, Farhad Hassan is located on
the northeast corner of the warehouse.

180
00:07:16,546 --> 00:07:18,280
We're gonna have to move
fast, because he's injured.

181
00:07:18,347 --> 00:07:21,049
King, Lynch, you're gonna
go in from the south.

182
00:07:21,117 --> 00:07:22,384
Owen and I will
cover your flank.

183
00:07:22,451 --> 00:07:23,985
- Understood.
- As soon as we've

184
00:07:24,053 --> 00:07:26,054
got him locked down, we're
gonna initiate our interrogation.

185
00:07:26,122 --> 00:07:27,255
CTU's gonna upload files on

186
00:07:27,323 --> 00:07:28,256
probable suspects-
I need that

187
00:07:28,324 --> 00:07:29,357
available and on a computer

188
00:07:29,425 --> 00:07:30,692
- as soon as possible.
- Yes, sir.

189
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,961
Mr. Bauer, we're getting
a call routed through CTU.

190
00:07:33,029 --> 00:07:33,995
It's Farhad Hassan.

191
00:07:34,063 --> 00:07:35,797
Put it on speaker.

192
00:07:35,865 --> 00:07:37,365
This is Jack Bauer. Go ahead.

193
00:07:37,433 --> 00:07:38,633
(quietly): How close are you?

194
00:07:38,701 --> 00:07:40,368
Ten minutes out. Are you okay?

195
00:07:40,436 --> 00:07:42,804
There's someone here.

196
00:07:42,872 --> 00:07:44,372
(crickets chirping)

197
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,841
They're close.

198
00:07:45,908 --> 00:07:47,742
They're looking for me.

199
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:50,979
Please... hurry.

200
00:07:55,818 --> 00:07:57,786
Madam President.

201
00:07:57,854 --> 00:07:59,721
I'm told you have my brother.

202
00:07:59,789 --> 00:08:00,956
What happened?

203
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,123
Please.

204
00:08:05,695 --> 00:08:07,195
He called CTU

205
00:08:07,263 --> 00:08:08,897
and surrendered himself.

206
00:08:08,965 --> 00:08:10,465
I don't understand.

207
00:08:10,533 --> 00:08:12,801
The men that Farhad
was working with

208
00:08:12,869 --> 00:08:14,069
turned against him,

209
00:08:14,136 --> 00:08:16,404
and they have taken
the nuclear rods.

210
00:08:16,472 --> 00:08:18,607
Now, he believes that
they intend to construct

211
00:08:18,674 --> 00:08:20,675
a dirty bomb to
attack this city.

212
00:08:20,743 --> 00:08:22,310
Now, apparently,
these men are members

213
00:08:22,378 --> 00:08:23,945
of your covert
intelligence operations

214
00:08:24,013 --> 00:08:25,480
here in the United States.

215
00:08:25,548 --> 00:08:27,983
I find that hard to believe.

216
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:29,951
Well, your brother
has no reason to lie.

217
00:08:30,019 --> 00:08:32,254
By turning himself in, he's
facing the death penalty.

218
00:08:32,321 --> 00:08:35,223
We have to assume
he's telling the truth.

219
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:38,260
I need for you to give
us intelligence files

220
00:08:38,327 --> 00:08:40,896
for every asset you
have in this country

221
00:08:40,963 --> 00:08:44,099
so Farhad can identify
these terrorists.

222
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:47,102
Mr. President,
I have given you

223
00:08:47,169 --> 00:08:48,737
a great deal of latitude

224
00:08:48,804 --> 00:08:50,805
to sort out your
domestic situation,

225
00:08:50,873 --> 00:08:53,842
and now there is a
threat to my homeland,

226
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:55,777
and I need your cooperation.

227
00:08:55,845 --> 00:08:58,647
I suggest you turn
Farhad over to me

228
00:08:58,714 --> 00:09:00,782
and let my people
question him.

229
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:02,183
We'll get the
answers you need.

230
00:09:02,251 --> 00:09:04,286
There's no time for that.
There's a CTU team

231
00:09:04,353 --> 00:09:06,087
moving on Farhad as we speak.

232
00:09:06,155 --> 00:09:07,889
They need to
question him on site.

233
00:09:07,957 --> 00:09:09,624
I need the files.

234
00:09:09,692 --> 00:09:12,527
What you're asking is a
serious breach of our security.

235
00:09:12,595 --> 00:09:13,995
I understand that.

236
00:09:14,063 --> 00:09:15,530
But you need to understand

237
00:09:15,598 --> 00:09:18,233
that if this radiological
attack takes place,

238
00:09:18,301 --> 00:09:20,869
I will be forced to retaliate.

239
00:09:22,905 --> 00:09:26,041
You would attack...
my country?

240
00:09:26,108 --> 00:09:29,077
I will have no choice.

241
00:09:32,648 --> 00:09:34,816
I need those files...

242
00:09:34,884 --> 00:09:37,018
and I need them now.

243
00:09:42,792 --> 00:09:46,094
I'll call my acting
head of security.

244
00:09:46,162 --> 00:09:49,030
You'll get the files
in a few minutes.

245
00:09:49,098 --> 00:09:50,932
Thank you.

246
00:10:14,223 --> 00:10:16,725
I want you to know,
Tarin, that I don't believe

247
00:10:16,792 --> 00:10:18,560
you are guilty of treason.

248
00:10:18,627 --> 00:10:21,796
But I have no choice
but to follow orders.

249
00:10:21,864 --> 00:10:24,299
You don't have to
explain yourself, Nabeel.

250
00:10:24,367 --> 00:10:26,568
I would do the same
thing in your position.

251
00:10:26,635 --> 00:10:30,705
I don't hold any
of this against you.

252
00:10:31,941 --> 00:10:34,042
Whatever happens to me,

253
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:35,677
you must not blame yourself.

254
00:10:35,745 --> 00:10:37,545
Never forget that.

255
00:10:37,613 --> 00:10:39,347
I appreciate that.

256
00:10:45,788 --> 00:10:47,622
- Don't move.
- What are you doing?

257
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:49,157
Nabeel, give me
your weapon now.

258
00:10:49,225 --> 00:10:50,425
Slowly, two fingers.

259
00:10:50,493 --> 00:10:51,960
Come on.

260
00:10:55,698 --> 00:10:57,332
Driver, pull over here.

261
00:11:03,272 --> 00:11:05,140
Remove your seat belts.

262
00:11:05,207 --> 00:11:07,942
Put your hands on
your head, both of you.

263
00:11:13,149 --> 00:11:15,283
Get out of the car now.

264
00:11:15,351 --> 00:11:16,885
Don't move.

265
00:11:16,952 --> 00:11:18,153
Give me the keys.

266
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:23,925
Put your hands down.
Tarin, don't do this.

267
00:11:23,993 --> 00:11:25,927
You'll only make things
worse for yourself.

268
00:11:25,995 --> 00:11:27,996
You know what they'll
do to me at our embassy.

269
00:11:28,064 --> 00:11:29,364
It can't be any worse.

270
00:11:29,432 --> 00:11:31,232
(phone ringing)

271
00:11:33,702 --> 00:11:35,437
It's President Hassan.

272
00:11:35,504 --> 00:11:37,072
Give it to me.

273
00:11:37,139 --> 00:11:38,807
Come on!

274
00:11:42,278 --> 00:11:43,778
Let's go. In the back.

275
00:11:43,846 --> 00:11:46,014
(ringing continues)

276
00:11:46,082 --> 00:11:48,950
Open it up.

277
00:11:49,018 --> 00:11:51,319
Take out your cuffs.
Lock yourselves down.

278
00:11:51,387 --> 00:11:54,122
(ringing continues)

279
00:12:00,296 --> 00:12:02,831
Nabeel isn't answering.

280
00:12:02,898 --> 00:12:04,132
Where is he?

281
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,234
Transporting Tarin
to the embassy.

282
00:12:06,302 --> 00:12:07,969
Keep trying to reach
him on his mobile.

283
00:12:08,037 --> 00:12:10,004
If he doesn't answer,

284
00:12:10,072 --> 00:12:11,573
send a security
team to track him.

285
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,941
Yes, sir.

286
00:12:13,008 --> 00:12:14,142
And contact Colonel Al Jhanis.

287
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:15,543
Tell him on my authority

288
00:12:15,611 --> 00:12:17,612
to give CTU access to
the files they requested.

289
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,947
Yes, sir.

290
00:12:30,659 --> 00:12:33,628
(phone ringing)

291
00:12:33,696 --> 00:12:34,963
Hello.

292
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:36,131
It's me. Where are you?

293
00:12:36,198 --> 00:12:37,632
I'm leaving the
U.N. right now.

294
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,200
Is everything all right?

295
00:12:39,268 --> 00:12:41,102
Yes, it worked.
Meet me at the hotel.

296
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:42,670
I'll be there in ten minutes.

297
00:12:42,738 --> 00:12:45,173
I love you, Kayla.

298
00:12:45,241 --> 00:12:46,808
I'll see you soon.

299
00:13:03,837 --> 00:13:05,560
<i>(over headset): Go ahead, Mr. Hastings.</i>

300
00:13:05,615 --> 00:13:07,049
Farhad, are you there?

301
00:13:07,117 --> 00:13:10,018
Yes, yes, I'm here.

302
00:13:10,086 --> 00:13:11,920
<i>Our field team is approaching
the south entrance.</i>

303
00:13:11,988 --> 00:13:14,490
Stay where you are until
they secure the site.

304
00:13:14,557 --> 00:13:16,592
He's almost on me.

305
00:13:16,659 --> 00:13:18,227
<i>I can't stay here.</i>

306
00:13:18,294 --> 00:13:20,496
Do not move until they
lock down that shooter.

307
00:13:20,563 --> 00:13:22,398
Do you understand me?

308
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,069
Farhad?

309
00:13:27,137 --> 00:13:28,904
Farhad?!

310
00:13:28,972 --> 00:13:31,573
Farhad, talk to me.

311
00:13:36,112 --> 00:13:37,112
(rapid gunshots)

312
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:42,050
(tires squealing)

313
00:13:55,331 --> 00:13:57,599
<i>Over here!</i>

314
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:02,237
<i>Medic! Come on! Medic!</i>

315
00:14:02,305 --> 00:14:03,806
JACK: That's him,
that's Farhad.

316
00:14:03,873 --> 00:14:05,707
Owen, take your team
and sweep the area.

317
00:14:05,775 --> 00:14:07,576
Chloe, we've got Farhad,
but he's been hit.

318
00:14:07,644 --> 00:14:09,044
I need those
files immediately.

319
00:14:09,112 --> 00:14:10,979
I.R.K. intelligence
just sent them over.

320
00:14:11,047 --> 00:14:12,047
Good.

321
00:14:16,719 --> 00:14:20,055
(phone ringing)

322
00:14:20,123 --> 00:14:21,323
Yes?

323
00:14:21,391 --> 00:14:22,591
It's done.

324
00:14:22,659 --> 00:14:24,493
Farhad is no longer a problem.

325
00:14:24,561 --> 00:14:25,661
Are you sure?

326
00:14:25,728 --> 00:14:27,196
I shot him twice, but
the police arrived,

327
00:14:27,263 --> 00:14:28,764
and I had to get out of there.

328
00:14:28,832 --> 00:14:31,133
You know where to find us.

329
00:14:31,201 --> 00:14:32,668
Yes.

330
00:14:35,672 --> 00:14:37,206
Mr. Bauer.

331
00:14:37,273 --> 00:14:39,141
Speak to me. We have two large
caliber slugs to the abdomen.

332
00:14:39,209 --> 00:14:41,410
He's bleeding out. I don't think
he's going to make it to the hospital.

333
00:14:41,478 --> 00:14:43,579
Do whatever you have
to do to stabilize him.

334
00:14:43,646 --> 00:14:45,647
We need to talk
to him now. Go!

335
00:14:46,716 --> 00:14:48,183
This is B team.

336
00:14:48,251 --> 00:14:51,620
We found their truck, but
there's no sign of the rods.

337
00:15:05,668 --> 00:15:08,537
Let me know as soon as
these files are uploaded.

338
00:15:08,605 --> 00:15:10,639
Mr. Hassan, in a few seconds,

339
00:15:10,707 --> 00:15:12,808
I'm going to show you
photographs of covert operatives

340
00:15:12,876 --> 00:15:14,810
working for your country
within the United States.

341
00:15:14,878 --> 00:15:16,945
I need you to identify the
men who stole the nuclear rods

342
00:15:17,013 --> 00:15:18,514
from you. Can you
do that for us?

343
00:15:18,581 --> 00:15:19,548
Yes.

344
00:15:19,616 --> 00:15:21,450
Are those files uploaded yet?!

345
00:15:21,518 --> 00:15:22,885
Almost. Come on!

346
00:15:22,952 --> 00:15:24,386
Blood pressure's dropping.
We've got a rapid heartbeat.

347
00:15:24,454 --> 00:15:25,888
What the hell's happening?

348
00:15:25,955 --> 00:15:27,656
He's going into shock.
Give me 30 cc's epinephrine.

349
00:15:27,724 --> 00:15:29,224
You keep that man alive,
do you understand me?

350
00:15:29,292 --> 00:15:31,393
Keep him alive!
Let me do my job!

351
00:15:38,301 --> 00:15:40,068
The telepresence conference

352
00:15:40,136 --> 00:15:42,404
- is ready, Madam President.
- Thank you.

353
00:15:50,246 --> 00:15:51,880
Good to see you, gentlemen.

354
00:15:51,948 --> 00:15:53,949
Madam President,
Brian Hastings at CTU

355
00:15:54,017 --> 00:15:55,717
has brought us up to speed,

356
00:15:55,785 --> 00:15:57,686
and we're ready to review
some specifics with you.

357
00:15:57,754 --> 00:15:59,021
Good. I'm listening.

358
00:15:59,088 --> 00:16:01,390
If you would refer
to your monitor...

359
00:16:01,457 --> 00:16:04,359
and the diagram of
Midtown Manhattan.

360
00:16:04,427 --> 00:16:06,094
According to CTU,

361
00:16:06,162 --> 00:16:08,997
the stolen nuclear rods have
a maximum explosive yield

362
00:16:09,065 --> 00:16:10,198
of 300 pounds.

363
00:16:10,266 --> 00:16:11,733
That's enough
radiological material

364
00:16:11,801 --> 00:16:13,468
to contaminate approximately
one square mile.

365
00:16:13,536 --> 00:16:15,737
If the device were detonated

366
00:16:15,805 --> 00:16:18,473
in a more densely
populated area of Manhattan,

367
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:20,075
we could be looking
at casualties

368
00:16:20,143 --> 00:16:23,011
in the tens of thousands.

369
00:16:23,079 --> 00:16:24,513
Dr. Landry?

370
00:16:24,581 --> 00:16:27,182
Most of the deaths would be
from severe radiation poisoning.

371
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,885
The remainder of the
victims would expire

372
00:16:29,953 --> 00:16:31,219
from radiation
induced illnesses.

373
00:16:31,287 --> 00:16:32,521
Primarily leukemia

374
00:16:32,589 --> 00:16:33,855
and other cancers.

375
00:16:33,923 --> 00:16:36,558
We also have to consider
that the affected area

376
00:16:36,626 --> 00:16:37,693
would be rendered
uninhabitable

377
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,195
for approximately 40 years.

378
00:16:40,263 --> 00:16:43,098
Obviously a citywide evacuation
is out of the question.

379
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:44,866
That's right. There are
millions of people on this island

380
00:16:44,934 --> 00:16:46,068
with few points of egress.

381
00:16:46,135 --> 00:16:47,436
It would take days
to get them out.

382
00:16:47,503 --> 00:16:49,671
Not to mention that going
public with this information

383
00:16:49,739 --> 00:16:51,139
would cause mass panic.

384
00:16:51,207 --> 00:16:53,976
I agree. We need to keep this
threat from the public for now.

385
00:16:54,043 --> 00:16:58,547
Focus our efforts on making sure
that this attack never happens.

386
00:16:58,615 --> 00:17:00,415
CTU believes the nuclear rods
are still outside the city,

387
00:17:00,483 --> 00:17:01,750
so they're fortifying
radiation detection efforts

388
00:17:01,818 --> 00:17:03,118
at the bridges and tunnels.

389
00:17:03,186 --> 00:17:06,421
We are also hardening
high value targets

390
00:17:06,489 --> 00:17:09,124
such as the financial
district, landmarks, subways.

391
00:17:09,192 --> 00:17:11,727
But we can't ignore that the
U.N. may also be a target.

392
00:17:11,794 --> 00:17:14,296
Give the danger, I think we should
evacuate the entire building.

393
00:17:14,364 --> 00:17:16,698
We can resume the conference
from a safe location.

394
00:17:20,136 --> 00:17:23,405
All right, inform the
delegates of the situation.

395
00:17:23,473 --> 00:17:26,041
- Thank you, gentlemen.
- Madam President.

396
00:17:34,917 --> 00:17:36,785
CTU has your
brother in custody.

397
00:17:36,853 --> 00:17:38,253
He's been shot.

398
00:17:38,321 --> 00:17:39,855
They're trying
to stabilize him.

399
00:17:39,922 --> 00:17:41,056
(two beeps)

400
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:43,492
Yes?

401
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:45,394
MAN: Sir, Agent Rahim
is calling for you.

402
00:17:45,461 --> 00:17:46,662
He says he's located Nabeel.

403
00:17:46,729 --> 00:17:47,829
- Put him through.
- Yes, sir.

404
00:17:49,165 --> 00:17:51,400
Mr. President, we found
Nabeel and his driver

405
00:17:51,467 --> 00:17:52,968
locked down in the
back of their vehicle.

406
00:17:53,036 --> 00:17:54,636
- Tarin has escaped.
- What?!

407
00:17:54,704 --> 00:17:56,304
Nabeel wishes to
speak to you, sir.

408
00:17:56,372 --> 00:17:57,706
Yes, okay, put him on.

409
00:18:00,877 --> 00:18:03,512
I'm sorry, Mr. President.

410
00:18:03,579 --> 00:18:05,580
Tarin had a gun with him.

411
00:18:05,648 --> 00:18:06,848
I don't understand how.

412
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:09,017
Are you saying somebody
helped him escape?

413
00:18:09,085 --> 00:18:10,686
It would seem so.

414
00:18:10,753 --> 00:18:12,187
But Mr. President,

415
00:18:12,255 --> 00:18:14,156
there's something
else you need to know.

416
00:18:14,223 --> 00:18:19,027
Right after he escaped, I
overheard Tarin on the phone.

417
00:18:19,095 --> 00:18:22,831
(whispering): I believe he
was speaking to your daughter.

418
00:18:26,569 --> 00:18:29,738
Kayla? Are you
sure about this?

419
00:18:29,806 --> 00:18:30,739
Yes, sir.

420
00:18:30,807 --> 00:18:32,908
It sounded like he
was going to meet her

421
00:18:32,975 --> 00:18:35,444
somewhere in the city.

422
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,794
(phone ringing)

423
00:18:55,031 --> 00:18:56,031
(phone beeps)

424
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,901
Kayla, call me back.

425
00:18:59,969 --> 00:19:02,370
Call me back, Kayla.

426
00:19:02,438 --> 00:19:04,306
(sighs)

427
00:19:12,815 --> 00:19:14,316
Come inside.

428
00:19:18,621 --> 00:19:21,590
Oh, thank God,
you're all right.

429
00:19:25,695 --> 00:19:26,962
Oh!

430
00:19:27,029 --> 00:19:28,864
I contacted an
American lawyer I know

431
00:19:28,931 --> 00:19:31,299
who's an expert at
international law.

432
00:19:31,367 --> 00:19:33,301
He's agreed to meet
us in two hours.

433
00:19:33,369 --> 00:19:35,904
This is such a
terrible situation.

434
00:19:35,972 --> 00:19:37,806
Yet I've never felt so happy.

435
00:19:37,874 --> 00:19:39,708
I feel the same.

436
00:19:48,151 --> 00:19:49,484
Mm!

437
00:19:53,923 --> 00:19:55,957
Mr. Bauer, we did our best.

438
00:19:56,025 --> 00:19:57,559
He didn't make it.

439
00:19:57,627 --> 00:19:59,728
I know you did. Thanks.

440
00:19:59,796 --> 00:20:01,596
We swept the area,
sir. It's clear.

441
00:20:01,664 --> 00:20:02,998
No hostiles. No trace
of the nuclear rods.

442
00:20:03,065 --> 00:20:04,299
Copy that.

443
00:20:04,367 --> 00:20:05,667
CTU, this is Bauer.

444
00:20:05,735 --> 00:20:07,769
We lost him. Farhad's dead.

445
00:20:07,837 --> 00:20:08,904
Damn it.

446
00:20:08,971 --> 00:20:10,438
I still think we've
got another play.

447
00:20:10,506 --> 00:20:13,542
Whoever shot Farhad couldn't
confirm that he was killed.

448
00:20:13,609 --> 00:20:15,177
We came up on him too fast.

449
00:20:15,244 --> 00:20:17,145
They don't know how
badly he was wounded.

450
00:20:17,213 --> 00:20:18,346
So what are you
proposing, Jack?

451
00:20:18,414 --> 00:20:19,781
I'm saying that we use
Farhad as dead bait.

452
00:20:19,849 --> 00:20:21,583
Leak it to the press that
we've got him in custody,

453
00:20:21,651 --> 00:20:22,851
and he survived.

454
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:24,085
We're transporting
him to a local hospital

455
00:20:24,153 --> 00:20:25,353
where authorities are
going to question him.

456
00:20:25,421 --> 00:20:26,955
They'll have to
make a move on him.

457
00:20:27,023 --> 00:20:28,957
- He knows too much.
- Sounds like a Hail Mary.

458
00:20:29,025 --> 00:20:30,826
Right now it's the
only play we've got.

459
00:20:30,893 --> 00:20:32,828
But if they make a move on
Farhad, which I think they will,

460
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:34,196
we'll be waiting for them.

461
00:20:34,263 --> 00:20:36,464
Mr. Hastings, you
said you wanted me in

462
00:20:36,532 --> 00:20:38,300
till this was
resolved. This is it.

463
00:20:38,367 --> 00:20:40,068
We have Hassan's
intelligence files.

464
00:20:40,136 --> 00:20:41,603
We can scan and
cross-reference

465
00:20:41,671 --> 00:20:42,938
with facial
recognition software.

466
00:20:43,005 --> 00:20:45,340
Maybe spot the terrorists
before they attack.

467
00:20:45,408 --> 00:20:46,942
All right, Jack.

468
00:20:47,009 --> 00:20:49,177
It's not exactly
standard procedure

469
00:20:49,245 --> 00:20:51,346
ferrying a dead man's
body across the city,

470
00:20:51,414 --> 00:20:53,014
but I'm willing
to give it a shot.

471
00:20:53,082 --> 00:20:54,216
We'll figure out
a hospital route

472
00:20:54,283 --> 00:20:55,450
and put a press
statement together.

473
00:20:55,518 --> 00:20:56,885
You get ready on your end.

474
00:20:56,953 --> 00:20:58,253
Okay, thank you.

475
00:20:58,321 --> 00:20:59,621
Get that body
ready for transport.

476
00:20:59,689 --> 00:21:00,989
Owen, assemble your men.

477
00:21:01,057 --> 00:21:02,490
Briefing in less than five.

478
00:21:10,718 --> 00:21:12,952
Aerial one is in position
over the route, sir.

479
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:15,688
Sniper teams have checked
in. They're all in place.

480
00:21:24,931 --> 00:21:26,232
Come on, hurry up.

481
00:21:28,769 --> 00:21:30,736
(zipping bag)

482
00:21:31,671 --> 00:21:33,939
Let's go.

483
00:21:34,007 --> 00:21:35,541
(both grunting)

484
00:21:47,487 --> 00:21:49,989
(panting)

485
00:21:52,426 --> 00:21:54,760
(water gurgling)

486
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:09,475
(water burbling)

487
00:22:12,646 --> 00:22:13,913
It's over, Dana.

488
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:15,214
Let's get the other body

489
00:22:15,282 --> 00:22:16,215
and get cleaned up

490
00:22:16,283 --> 00:22:19,351
before we head back to CTU.

491
00:22:27,427 --> 00:22:29,128
Cole, what about us?

492
00:22:31,198 --> 00:22:32,832
I don't know.

493
00:22:37,237 --> 00:22:40,039
(grunting)

494
00:22:41,141 --> 00:22:42,842
We have just received word

495
00:22:42,909 --> 00:22:45,344
from New York
Counterterrorist Headquarters

496
00:22:45,412 --> 00:22:47,012
that Farhad
Hassan- brother of

497
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:50,015
Islamic Republic of Kamistan
President Omar Hassan-

498
00:22:50,083 --> 00:22:52,384
has been found alive.

499
00:22:52,452 --> 00:22:55,321
We're told that Farhad
Hassan contacted CTU

500
00:22:55,388 --> 00:22:57,490
a short while ago and agreed
to turn him over to authorities.

501
00:22:57,557 --> 00:22:58,491
Farhad is alive.

502
00:22:58,558 --> 00:23:00,059
What?

503
00:23:00,127 --> 00:23:01,227
CTU responded immediately,

504
00:23:01,294 --> 00:23:02,995
but when they arrived,
they found him shot.

505
00:23:03,063 --> 00:23:05,664
No word yet on how
Farhad Hassan sustained

506
00:23:05,732 --> 00:23:06,899
these gunshot injuries,

507
00:23:06,967 --> 00:23:09,602
but we do know that he
is expected to survive,

508
00:23:09,669 --> 00:23:12,171
and he's being transported

509
00:23:12,239 --> 00:23:13,906
to St. Julian's Hospital
under heightened security

510
00:23:13,974 --> 00:23:15,875
where he will be
questioned by authorities.

511
00:23:15,942 --> 00:23:18,010
This is impossible.

512
00:23:18,078 --> 00:23:19,378
Farhad Hassan has been on the
run since early this evening...

513
00:23:19,446 --> 00:23:21,113
I shot him twice.

514
00:23:21,181 --> 00:23:23,516
But you didn't make
sure he was dead.

515
00:23:23,583 --> 00:23:25,417
I told you I didn't have time!

516
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:31,457
I'll make this
right. I'll go back.

517
00:23:31,525 --> 00:23:32,558
You're too conspicuous.

518
00:23:32,626 --> 00:23:35,127
Farhad will be
heavily protected.

519
00:23:35,195 --> 00:23:36,562
But if Farhad talks,

520
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:39,665
the authorities could find us
before we can build the weapon.

521
00:23:42,035 --> 00:23:44,170
You think we don't
know the implications?

522
00:23:46,873 --> 00:23:48,107
We're sending Marcos.

523
00:23:48,175 --> 00:23:50,109
His mother's American.

524
00:23:50,177 --> 00:23:51,644
They won't suspect him.

525
00:23:51,711 --> 00:23:53,913
He's in the truck
with the rods.

526
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:55,948
The peace treaty
may now be halted

527
00:23:56,016 --> 00:23:57,983
due to a series of
alleged terrorist attacks.

528
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:11,697
(phone flips open)

529
00:24:11,765 --> 00:24:13,265
(speed-dial tone)

530
00:24:15,769 --> 00:24:17,803
ELAINE (over phone): Hello?

531
00:24:17,871 --> 00:24:19,138
Mom, it's me.

532
00:24:19,206 --> 00:24:20,973
Marcos?

533
00:24:21,041 --> 00:24:23,709
Yes. Listen, I
can't talk for long.

534
00:24:23,777 --> 00:24:25,177
What is it? Are you okay?

535
00:24:25,245 --> 00:24:26,679
I'm fine, Mom.

536
00:24:26,746 --> 00:24:29,481
I need you to do
something for me.

537
00:24:29,549 --> 00:24:30,516
It's very important.

538
00:24:30,584 --> 00:24:32,718
Okay.

539
00:24:32,786 --> 00:24:34,019
Okay. What is it?

540
00:24:34,087 --> 00:24:37,790
I need you to get up right
now and leave the city.

541
00:24:37,857 --> 00:24:38,824
Go to Aunt Shelley's.

542
00:24:38,892 --> 00:24:39,825
Aunt Shelley's?!

543
00:24:39,893 --> 00:24:41,360
Just do it for me, okay?

544
00:24:41,428 --> 00:24:42,361
Don't ask me why.

545
00:24:42,429 --> 00:24:44,063
Leave right now.

546
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:45,998
Marcos,

547
00:24:46,066 --> 00:24:47,299
this is crazy...

548
00:24:47,367 --> 00:24:48,634
I'm not gonna
leave the apartment

549
00:24:48,702 --> 00:24:50,469
in the middle of the
night for no reason.

550
00:24:50,537 --> 00:24:53,339
There's a reason; I just can't
tell you what it is right now.

551
00:24:53,406 --> 00:24:55,441
Please, Mom, do this for me.

552
00:24:55,508 --> 00:24:56,909
Where are you?

553
00:24:56,977 --> 00:24:58,777
Don't worry about me.

554
00:24:58,845 --> 00:25:00,846
Well, I'm not going
anywhere unless I know

555
00:25:00,914 --> 00:25:01,981
you're all right.

556
00:25:02,048 --> 00:25:03,649
I'll meet you at
Aunt Shelley's,

557
00:25:03,717 --> 00:25:04,650
and I'll explain everything.

558
00:25:04,718 --> 00:25:07,186
Go, Mom, now.

559
00:25:09,723 --> 00:25:11,156
Okay, I'm leaving.

560
00:25:11,224 --> 00:25:12,858
(door latch clanks)

561
00:25:12,926 --> 00:25:15,160
I have to go. I love you.

562
00:25:23,903 --> 00:25:26,005
Are you ready, my friend?

563
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,574
Yes.

564
00:25:28,642 --> 00:25:30,309
Good.

565
00:25:30,377 --> 00:25:31,577
It's time.

566
00:25:33,713 --> 00:25:36,482
You need to keep him
looking alive the entire way.

567
00:25:36,549 --> 00:25:38,951
You're all clear on
what you need to do?

568
00:25:39,019 --> 00:25:40,019
Yes, sir.

569
00:25:40,086 --> 00:25:41,654
Jack, it's Hastings. Go ahead.

570
00:25:41,721 --> 00:25:43,155
We've coordinated
with news outlets.

571
00:25:43,223 --> 00:25:45,624
They put out the false
report of Farhad's arrest

572
00:25:45,692 --> 00:25:46,825
and transport to the hospital

573
00:25:46,893 --> 00:25:47,826
for questioning.

574
00:25:47,894 --> 00:25:49,695
The hook has been baited.

575
00:25:49,763 --> 00:25:51,163
Okay. The most
logical place for them

576
00:25:51,231 --> 00:25:52,498
to attack is when
we're en route.

577
00:25:52,565 --> 00:25:54,033
That's where we're gonna
be our most vulnerable.

578
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:56,335
Well, NYPD and SWAT
are mobilizing now.

579
00:25:56,403 --> 00:25:57,670
They're going to be embedded

580
00:25:57,737 --> 00:25:59,505
at strategic points
along the way.

581
00:25:59,572 --> 00:26:01,774
They're also securing
St. Julian's Hospital.

582
00:26:01,841 --> 00:26:03,509
Copy that. Tell
the support teams

583
00:26:03,576 --> 00:26:05,444
it is imperative that we
take these terrorists alive.

584
00:26:05,512 --> 00:26:06,779
They've been briefed, Jack.

585
00:26:06,846 --> 00:26:07,780
Okay, we're moving out.

586
00:26:07,847 --> 00:26:09,148
You two take the follow van.

587
00:26:09,215 --> 00:26:10,983
Owen, you're with
me in the ambulance.

588
00:26:11,051 --> 00:26:12,651
Copy that.

589
00:26:12,719 --> 00:26:15,187
Hey, are you all right?

590
00:26:15,255 --> 00:26:16,755
Yes, sir.

591
00:26:16,823 --> 00:26:18,590
(whispering): Look, I
know you and your men

592
00:26:18,658 --> 00:26:20,225
have not had a lot
of field experience,

593
00:26:20,293 --> 00:26:22,227
and we have put you in
an extreme situation.

594
00:26:22,295 --> 00:26:24,163
But I promise you,
if we're attacked,

595
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:26,065
every part of this
route is covered.

596
00:26:26,132 --> 00:26:27,966
We've got a lot of
support out there.

597
00:26:28,034 --> 00:26:30,336
I'm fine, Mr. Bauer.

598
00:26:30,403 --> 00:26:31,503
Let's do this.

599
00:26:34,741 --> 00:26:36,075
Yeah.

600
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,914
Our delegation is
preparing to head

601
00:27:04,982 --> 00:27:06,249
to McGuire Air force Base.

602
00:27:06,317 --> 00:27:08,184
We'll be setting up a
temporary ops center there,

603
00:27:08,252 --> 00:27:10,653
where we'll be able to
monitor the situation.

604
00:27:10,721 --> 00:27:11,821
And the other delegates?

605
00:27:11,889 --> 00:27:13,289
U.N. Security will
coordinate the evacuation.

606
00:27:13,357 --> 00:27:15,325
Everything should go smoothly.

607
00:27:17,027 --> 00:27:18,695
Can I get you anything,

608
00:27:18,763 --> 00:27:19,829
Madam President?

609
00:27:19,897 --> 00:27:21,898
No, thank you, Rob.

610
00:27:21,966 --> 00:27:23,500
You have done
more than enough.

611
00:27:23,567 --> 00:27:25,769
I'm just sorry that
your first few months

612
00:27:25,836 --> 00:27:28,304
on the job have
been so challenging.

613
00:27:28,372 --> 00:27:30,407
I wouldn't have had
it any other way.

614
00:27:33,611 --> 00:27:35,645
I'll see you in a moment.

615
00:27:40,918 --> 00:27:43,653
I spoke to one of my aides.

616
00:27:43,721 --> 00:27:46,156
He told me my
brother is... dead.

617
00:27:46,223 --> 00:27:48,358
I'm afraid so.

618
00:27:48,426 --> 00:27:50,894
When CTU is finished
with their operation,

619
00:27:50,961 --> 00:27:53,363
I would like Farhad's remains

620
00:27:53,431 --> 00:27:55,565
to be returned to my country.

621
00:27:55,633 --> 00:27:57,333
Personally, I don't
care where his body rots,

622
00:27:57,401 --> 00:28:00,303
but my mother will
want a proper burial.

623
00:28:00,371 --> 00:28:02,372
I'll see that it's done.

624
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,374
But right now, Mr. President,

625
00:28:04,442 --> 00:28:06,409
we must all evacuate the U.N.

626
00:28:06,477 --> 00:28:08,178
I'm not leaving,

627
00:28:08,245 --> 00:28:10,213
Madame President.
I'm staying here.

628
00:28:10,281 --> 00:28:11,714
I don't understand.

629
00:28:11,782 --> 00:28:15,518
My daughter Kayla is missing.

630
00:28:15,586 --> 00:28:18,421
Missing?

631
00:28:18,489 --> 00:28:21,991
Kayla is romantically involved
with my former head of security.

632
00:28:22,059 --> 00:28:23,893
She's run off with him.

633
00:28:23,961 --> 00:28:25,628
Tell me what we
can do to help.

634
00:28:25,696 --> 00:28:26,896
I appreciate that,

635
00:28:26,964 --> 00:28:29,699
but my security teams
are searching for her now.

636
00:28:29,767 --> 00:28:33,002
I understand how
worried you must be,

637
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:34,771
but there is nothing
that you can do

638
00:28:34,839 --> 00:28:36,105
to help her by staying here.

639
00:28:36,173 --> 00:28:38,942
Please come where
you'll be safe.

640
00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:40,944
I can't, Madam President.

641
00:28:41,011 --> 00:28:43,112
She's somewhere in the city,

642
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:46,049
with no idea that a
nuclear threat exists.

643
00:28:46,116 --> 00:28:50,954
I won't go anywhere
until she's been found.

644
00:28:51,021 --> 00:28:52,489
All right.

645
00:28:55,125 --> 00:28:56,593
I understand.

646
00:28:57,761 --> 00:28:59,529
I will talk to you very soon.

647
00:28:59,597 --> 00:29:01,064
Thank you.

648
00:29:11,242 --> 00:29:13,042
They're turning
west Sixth Street.

649
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:14,477
Pulling into the hospital.

650
00:29:37,835 --> 00:29:40,169
Chloe, bring up the
hospital security feed.

651
00:29:40,237 --> 00:29:43,506
Get facial recognition
up and running.

652
00:29:48,879 --> 00:29:51,014
CTU, this is Bauer. We're
moving into position.

653
00:29:51,081 --> 00:29:53,116
Farhad's body's been
taken to his room.

654
00:29:54,818 --> 00:29:57,654
Let's go!

655
00:29:59,523 --> 00:30:02,025
Secure these doors!

656
00:30:22,179 --> 00:30:23,980
HASTINGS: Bring up
the exterior cameras.

657
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:55,111
♪ ♪

658
00:31:11,795 --> 00:31:13,463
(phone rings)

659
00:31:15,265 --> 00:31:16,532
This is Bauer.

660
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,534
Jack, it's me.

661
00:31:18,602 --> 00:31:19,836
Hey.

662
00:31:19,903 --> 00:31:21,437
I've been released.
I'm free to go.

663
00:31:21,505 --> 00:31:22,739
Good.

664
00:31:22,806 --> 00:31:24,407
Chloe told me what you did.

665
00:31:24,475 --> 00:31:25,742
You leveraged Hastings.

666
00:31:25,809 --> 00:31:27,377
Said that you would
head up field ops

667
00:31:27,444 --> 00:31:29,045
until this crisis was over

668
00:31:29,113 --> 00:31:33,549
in exchange for CTU dropping
any possible charges against me.

669
00:31:33,617 --> 00:31:36,285
I didn't ask you
to do that, Jack.

670
00:31:36,353 --> 00:31:37,820
I know you didn't.

671
00:31:37,888 --> 00:31:39,989
Look, someone in the White
House is trying to set you up

672
00:31:40,057 --> 00:31:42,091
to take responsibility for
the failure of our mission,

673
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:44,293
and I couldn't let that happen

674
00:31:44,361 --> 00:31:46,462
because you did nothing wrong.

675
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:47,797
You understand me?

676
00:31:47,865 --> 00:31:50,266
Renee, you need
to let this go.

677
00:31:50,334 --> 00:31:52,735
You're not responsible
for what's happening

678
00:31:52,803 --> 00:31:54,604
Yeah, okay.

679
00:31:54,672 --> 00:31:59,409
Hey, I meant what
I said earlier.

680
00:31:59,476 --> 00:32:03,179
When this is over, I want
to be there for you...

681
00:32:03,247 --> 00:32:04,313
with you.

682
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:07,316
I'd like that.

683
00:32:07,384 --> 00:32:10,053
I'll have a CTU agent
take you to my apartment.

684
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:12,522
I'll meet you there
when this is over.

685
00:32:12,589 --> 00:32:14,323
All right, Jack.

686
00:32:15,926 --> 00:32:18,094
Look, I'm getting chatter
over the comm. I gotta go.

687
00:32:18,162 --> 00:32:20,296
Okay, bye.

688
00:32:21,632 --> 00:32:22,665
This is Bauer. Go ahead.

689
00:32:22,733 --> 00:32:24,000
HASTINGS: Jack,

690
00:32:24,068 --> 00:32:25,635
facial recognition
just picked up a match

691
00:32:25,703 --> 00:32:28,071
with the I.R.K.
intelligence files.

692
00:32:28,138 --> 00:32:30,073
His name's Marcos Al-Zacar.

693
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:31,140
American-born.

694
00:32:31,208 --> 00:32:32,975
Working undercover
with the I.R.K.

695
00:32:33,043 --> 00:32:34,043
for the last three years.

696
00:32:34,111 --> 00:32:35,144
Where is he?

697
00:32:35,212 --> 00:32:36,145
Approaching the side entrance.

698
00:32:36,213 --> 00:32:37,613
Brown hair, blue scrubs,

699
00:32:37,681 --> 00:32:38,748
wearing aé dark-blue jacket.

700
00:32:38,816 --> 00:32:39,982
Copy that.

701
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:42,051
Hold on, Jack. he's got
something in his hand.

702
00:32:42,119 --> 00:32:43,519
It looks like a
remote detonator.

703
00:32:43,587 --> 00:32:45,354
I think he's wearing a vest.

704
00:32:45,422 --> 00:32:48,658
Chloe, can you
disarm it from there?

705
00:32:48,726 --> 00:32:50,660
Possibly, if I can pin
down the detonator model,

706
00:32:50,728 --> 00:32:52,762
I may be able to
scramble the arming code

707
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:54,397
using the transmitter
in the mobile comm.

708
00:32:54,465 --> 00:32:56,165
Get on it. Owen,
you've got a man

709
00:32:56,233 --> 00:32:58,301
approaching your position.
He's got brown hair.

710
00:32:58,368 --> 00:33:00,603
He's wearing green
scrubs and a blue jacket.

711
00:33:00,671 --> 00:33:03,139
Yeah. I see him.

712
00:33:03,207 --> 00:33:04,307
He's our hitter. We believe

713
00:33:04,374 --> 00:33:05,441
he's wearing an explosive vest

714
00:33:05,509 --> 00:33:06,576
with a remote detonator.

715
00:33:06,643 --> 00:33:07,744
Okay. What should I do?

716
00:33:07,811 --> 00:33:09,946
Stay calm and do
whatever he asks.

717
00:33:10,013 --> 00:33:11,748
CTU techs are going to try and
disarm the vest from offsite.

718
00:33:11,815 --> 00:33:14,083
Okay.

719
00:33:14,151 --> 00:33:15,318
Owen?

720
00:33:15,385 --> 00:33:16,586
Owen.

721
00:33:16,653 --> 00:33:18,387
You can do this.

722
00:33:18,455 --> 00:33:21,023
Just try and slow him
down as much as possible.

723
00:33:21,091 --> 00:33:22,892
We've got you covered
every inch of the way.

724
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,527
Yes, sir.

725
00:33:24,595 --> 00:33:26,596
(exhaling)

726
00:33:30,434 --> 00:33:31,667
Excuse me. This
is a secure area.

727
00:33:31,735 --> 00:33:33,136
I'm going to need
to see some I.D.

728
00:33:36,874 --> 00:33:38,941
Listen to me very carefully.

729
00:33:39,009 --> 00:33:41,110
I have a bomb.

730
00:33:41,178 --> 00:33:44,480
Give me your weapon right
now, or I'll kill us both.

731
00:33:46,283 --> 00:33:48,451
Your weapon now.

732
00:33:48,519 --> 00:33:50,086
Okay. Okay.

733
00:33:50,154 --> 00:33:51,487
Just take it easy.

734
00:33:51,555 --> 00:33:53,356
Slowly.

735
00:33:53,423 --> 00:33:55,424
Yeah.

736
00:34:03,567 --> 00:34:05,168
Where is Farhad Hassan?

737
00:34:05,235 --> 00:34:06,569
Third floor.

738
00:34:06,637 --> 00:34:08,304
Take me to him.

739
00:34:08,372 --> 00:34:09,572
Anyone asks who I am,

740
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:11,240
you say I'm a doctor,
and I'm cleared.

741
00:34:11,308 --> 00:34:12,341
Come on, son.

742
00:34:12,409 --> 00:34:14,076
Okay.

743
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:16,479
Move.

744
00:34:16,547 --> 00:34:17,713
Okay. Go.

745
00:34:43,256 --> 00:34:44,423
Hello?

746
00:34:44,490 --> 00:34:47,092
Dalia, it's me.

747
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,427
We need to talk.

748
00:34:48,494 --> 00:34:50,228
Don't try to change
my mind, Omar.

749
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:52,564
I told you, I'm leaving.

750
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:54,232
I haven't called
to change your mind.

751
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:58,103
I called because
Kayla may be in danger.

752
00:34:58,171 --> 00:34:59,337
What do you mean?

753
00:34:59,405 --> 00:35:01,773
She's run away with Tarin.

754
00:35:01,841 --> 00:35:02,908
They've been
seeing each other.

755
00:35:02,975 --> 00:35:04,142
I know.

756
00:35:06,412 --> 00:35:07,712
How long have you known?

757
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:09,648
What difference
does it make, Omar?

758
00:35:09,715 --> 00:35:11,283
What kind of danger is she in?

759
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:13,085
Farhad is dead.

760
00:35:13,152 --> 00:35:15,253
The nuclear material
he tried to acquire

761
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:16,855
is in the hands
of the terrorists.

762
00:35:16,923 --> 00:35:19,658
They're going to use
it here in Manhattan.

763
00:35:19,725 --> 00:35:20,792
No.

764
00:35:22,628 --> 00:35:23,762
How did this happen?

765
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:24,830
I'll explain later.

766
00:35:24,897 --> 00:35:26,932
But right now you
need to call Kayla.

767
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:29,000
I've left messages, but
she won't return my calls.

768
00:35:29,068 --> 00:35:30,669
But she might talk to you.

769
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:34,873
Please, Dalia.
She's angry at me.

770
00:35:34,941 --> 00:35:36,675
I had Tarin arrested.

771
00:35:36,742 --> 00:35:38,477
I thought he was part
of the conspiracy.

772
00:35:40,012 --> 00:35:42,447
All right.

773
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:44,449
But Omar, what about you?

774
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:46,184
Don't worry about me.

775
00:35:46,252 --> 00:35:48,186
Just help me
find our daughter.

776
00:35:48,254 --> 00:35:51,123
I- I'll try.

777
00:35:55,962 --> 00:35:57,963
Sabira, I need the captain.

778
00:36:25,958 --> 00:36:27,959
(elevator bell dings)

779
00:36:36,135 --> 00:36:38,770
Chloe, it's Jack. We're
moving to the third floor.

780
00:36:38,838 --> 00:36:40,005
Where are we at with the vest?

781
00:36:40,072 --> 00:36:41,573
I've identified
the detonator, Jack.

782
00:36:41,641 --> 00:36:43,775
It's German-made, K7 variant,

783
00:36:43,843 --> 00:36:46,244
but that model is used in
a lot of configurations.

784
00:36:46,312 --> 00:36:47,345
I'm going to need a
visual on the vest.

785
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:49,080
Copy that.

786
00:36:49,148 --> 00:36:50,515
Owen, it's Jack.

787
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:53,018
CTU cannot disarm the
vest unless they see it.

788
00:36:53,085 --> 00:36:54,186
I need you to get the hostile

789
00:36:54,253 --> 00:36:55,654
underneath one of the
surveillance cameras

790
00:36:55,721 --> 00:36:56,922
and make him show it to you.

791
00:36:56,989 --> 00:36:58,924
I repeat, CTU cannot
disarm the vest

792
00:36:58,991 --> 00:37:00,325
unless they see it.

793
00:37:00,393 --> 00:37:03,028
You ready?

794
00:37:12,505 --> 00:37:15,040
(over comm): Team three, they're
approaching your position.

795
00:37:31,591 --> 00:37:32,857
What are you doing?

796
00:37:32,925 --> 00:37:35,060
I want to see proof.

797
00:37:35,127 --> 00:37:36,661
Proof of what?

798
00:37:36,729 --> 00:37:37,862
A bomb.

799
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:41,099
I don't believe you have one.

800
00:37:41,167 --> 00:37:44,536
You don't keep moving,
you're gonna find out.

801
00:37:46,339 --> 00:37:49,941
Right now.

802
00:37:50,009 --> 00:37:54,079
You want Farhad, you show me.

803
00:37:55,114 --> 00:37:57,215
I said, "Move."

804
00:37:57,283 --> 00:37:59,618
No.

805
00:38:13,432 --> 00:38:14,432
Owen did it, Jack.

806
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,767
I've got a visual on the vest.

807
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:17,569
Now, move.

808
00:38:17,637 --> 00:38:21,339
Okay.

809
00:38:22,942 --> 00:38:24,342
We're set in position
near Farhad's room.

810
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:25,810
Now, what's the status?

811
00:38:25,878 --> 00:38:27,579
It's a DDR configuration.

812
00:38:27,647 --> 00:38:29,781
I just need to pull up the
frequency of the receiver.

813
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:31,182
Chloe, you've got
about 30 seconds

814
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:32,751
before they reach that room.

815
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:38,790
Got it.

816
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:40,892
3.15 gigahertz, standard GSM.

817
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,193
Running it through
the mobile comm now.

818
00:38:42,261 --> 00:38:43,895
This'll take a few seconds.

819
00:38:46,499 --> 00:38:48,533
Stand by for assault.

820
00:38:54,674 --> 00:38:56,074
On the floor, face down!

821
00:38:56,142 --> 00:38:57,676
Do it now!

822
00:38:57,743 --> 00:38:58,843
Don't move!

823
00:38:58,911 --> 00:39:01,846
Come on, Arlo. Hurry up.

824
00:39:03,282 --> 00:39:05,917
(timer beeping)

825
00:39:15,094 --> 00:39:16,961
That's it. It's done.

826
00:39:17,029 --> 00:39:18,730
Jack, the vest is disarmed.

827
00:39:18,798 --> 00:39:20,332
Move in. Go, go, go!

828
00:39:23,602 --> 00:39:26,338
(timer beeping)

829
00:39:34,146 --> 00:39:35,447
(grunts)

830
00:39:40,553 --> 00:39:42,554
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

831
00:39:45,558 --> 00:39:47,258
(door slams open)

832
00:39:49,328 --> 00:39:50,528
(gun clicks empty)

833
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:51,930
It's all right.

834
00:39:51,997 --> 00:39:53,198
It's all right.
Lower your weapons.

835
00:39:53,265 --> 00:39:54,933
It's all right.

836
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,669
I'm going to put my gun away.

837
00:39:57,737 --> 00:39:59,437
We're not here to hurt you.

838
00:39:59,505 --> 00:40:01,039
We just want to talk.

839
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:03,174
Stay calm.

840
00:40:03,242 --> 00:40:05,377
It's all right.

841
00:40:05,444 --> 00:40:08,813
I just want to talk to you.

842
00:40:11,817 --> 00:40:14,386
No. No!

843
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:15,887
(grunts)

844
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:24,129
He's still moving.
Notify the perimeter.

845
00:40:31,203 --> 00:40:34,572
Do not fire! He's unarmed!

846
00:40:53,559 --> 00:40:55,193
(slams shut)

847
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:04,169
(grunting and panting)

848
00:41:19,051 --> 00:41:21,052
(straining)

849
00:41:26,826 --> 00:41:28,460
This is Bauer.

850
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:30,195
I'm in the east wing.

851
00:41:30,262 --> 00:41:31,763
Suspect has barricaded himself

852
00:41:31,831 --> 00:41:33,231
in some kind of
pressure chamber.

853
00:41:33,299 --> 00:41:35,633
I need a team down here now
to help me open the door.

854
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:48,279
(cell phone ringing)

855
00:41:48,347 --> 00:41:49,447
Yes?

856
00:41:49,515 --> 00:41:50,615
MARCOS (on phone):
It was a trap.

857
00:41:50,683 --> 00:41:52,116
Farhad was already dead.

858
00:41:52,184 --> 00:41:54,152
What? The police were waiting.

859
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:55,720
They tried to ambush
me, but I got away.

860
00:41:55,788 --> 00:41:57,055
Where are you?

861
00:41:57,122 --> 00:41:59,557
I locked myself inside
some kind of oxygen chamber.

862
00:41:59,625 --> 00:42:00,725
They can't get in here.

863
00:42:00,793 --> 00:42:02,360
At least not yet.

864
00:42:02,428 --> 00:42:03,862
You know what you must do.

865
00:42:03,929 --> 00:42:05,296
I can't.

866
00:42:05,364 --> 00:42:08,533
I- I think they-they
scrambled the arming code.

867
00:42:08,601 --> 00:42:10,368
You need to set
it off manually.

868
00:42:10,436 --> 00:42:11,636
I don't know how to do that.

869
00:42:11,704 --> 00:42:12,937
I'll talk you through it.

870
00:42:13,005 --> 00:42:15,073
Can you open the
detonator control?

871
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:17,475
Yeah. I-I think so.

872
00:42:17,543 --> 00:42:19,744
Um, it's going
to take a minute.

873
00:42:19,812 --> 00:42:21,145
Work quickly.

874
00:42:21,213 --> 00:42:24,549
You cannot let
them take you alive.

875
00:42:29,221 --> 00:42:30,388
Can you hear me?

876
00:42:36,495 --> 00:42:38,496
JACK (over comm):
I just want to talk.

877
00:42:44,637 --> 00:42:49,407
