1
00:00:12,813 --> 00:00:18,171
Right now, terrorists are plotting to
assassinate a presidential candidate.

2
00:00:18,253 --> 00:00:20,847
My wife and daughter have been targeted.

3
00:00:20,933 --> 00:00:24,642
And people that I work with
may be involved in both.

4
00:00:25,253 --> 00:00:27,289
I'm Federal Agent Jack Bauer,

5
00:00:27,373 --> 00:00:31,002
and today is the longest day of my life.

6
00:00:34,093 --> 00:00:37,051
I still don't understand
why you're taking us to a safe house.

7
00:00:37,133 --> 00:00:40,205
A controlled environment
is the most secure place.

8
00:00:40,293 --> 00:00:44,002
- You're pregnant.
- It's as much a shock to me as it is to you.

9
00:00:44,093 --> 00:00:48,530
When Jack and I got back together again,
he told me he'd been with someone else.

10
00:00:48,613 --> 00:00:50,808
It was you, wasn't it?

11
00:00:51,093 --> 00:00:55,245
- Have you spoken to Jovan and Mishko?
- They have their targets in sight.

12
00:00:55,333 --> 00:00:58,848
- Palmer might not be leaving after all.
- Better for us.

13
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:01,925
I give you my word,
he will be dead by midnight.

14
00:01:02,013 --> 00:01:06,086
- You know about Operation Nightfall?
- I authorised the mission.

15
00:01:06,173 --> 00:01:08,607
I know you took out Victor Drazen.

16
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:12,527
- So this is payback for what happened?
- We're both on somebody's list.

17
00:01:12,613 --> 00:01:17,641
I understand you have Jack under arrest.
Reinstate him to his previous position.

18
00:01:17,733 --> 00:01:22,443
If someone could put your name and mine
on a list together, they'll find Robert Ellis too.

19
00:01:22,533 --> 00:01:24,205
What are you doing with Jack Bauer?

20
00:01:24,293 --> 00:01:27,683
Someone close to Victor Drazen
seems to have connected us.

21
00:01:27,773 --> 00:01:30,003
Lfwe're on the list, it's likely you are too.

22
00:01:30,093 --> 00:01:32,732
Can you give me an estimate
of when the file was stolen?

23
00:01:32,813 --> 00:01:35,008
I got some ideas on how...

24
00:01:35,373 --> 00:01:37,364
Bob?

25
00:01:52,373 --> 00:01:55,922
Bob, what just happened?
I can't hear you.

26
00:01:56,013 --> 00:01:58,481
Bob, can you hear me?

27
00:01:59,173 --> 00:02:01,209
Bob?

28
00:02:01,293 --> 00:02:03,284
Bob, can you hear me?

29
00:02:05,053 --> 00:02:06,884
Bob, pick up the phone.

30
00:02:08,453 --> 00:02:10,648
Somebody pick up the phone.

31
00:02:16,773 --> 00:02:18,968
Bob, can you hear me?

32
00:02:20,453 --> 00:02:23,251
Whoever's there, just pick up the phone.

33
00:02:24,453 --> 00:02:27,126
Bob?

34
00:02:27,213 --> 00:02:29,329
Can anyone hear me?

35
00:02:29,413 --> 00:02:32,007
Just pick up the phone.

36
00:02:32,093 --> 00:02:34,527
Pick up the pho...

37
00:02:38,293 --> 00:02:41,444
At the beep,
leave a message for Bob Ellis.

38
00:02:41,533 --> 00:02:43,524
Oh, God, no.

39
00:02:48,173 --> 00:02:50,368
Think, Jack. Just think.

40
00:02:57,813 --> 00:02:59,963
- Routing operator.
- This is Jack Bauer.

41
00:03:00,053 --> 00:03:03,363
I want you to transfer me to
Agent Watson in our New Orleans office.

42
00:03:03,453 --> 00:03:05,921
- One moment, please.
- Thank you.

43
00:03:07,693 --> 00:03:09,524
CTU New Orleans. Watson speaking.

44
00:03:09,613 --> 00:03:14,846
It's Jack Bauer at Los Angeles. You've got
an NSA operative in your region, Robert Ellis.

45
00:03:14,933 --> 00:03:18,130
- I think something happened to him.
- What would you like us to do?

46
00:03:18,213 --> 00:03:22,809
I'll transfer you to our comm. for the address.
Check it. Call me as soon you get anything.

47
00:03:22,893 --> 00:03:25,930
- Jack! Jack!
- I'll transfer you now. Not now, Milo.

48
00:03:26,013 --> 00:03:27,969
- Jack, you gotta see this.
- What?

49
00:03:28,053 --> 00:03:32,365
Look. These are surveillance shots
of all three backup shooters.

50
00:03:32,453 --> 00:03:36,446
I cross-referenced the files that Ellis
sent us with our Interpol records.

51
00:03:36,533 --> 00:03:39,206
- How long ago?
- Just now.

52
00:03:39,293 --> 00:03:42,171
Any or all of them could
still be targeting Palmer.

53
00:03:42,253 --> 00:03:44,005
Or you.

54
00:03:44,093 --> 00:03:46,971
- Right.
- I just sent the photos off to Secret Service.

55
00:03:47,053 --> 00:03:50,602
Make sure they brief Palmer's staff.
I want them to keep their eyes open.

56
00:03:50,693 --> 00:03:54,652
Right. There's one more thing, though.
"Johnny-cool guy" here.

57
00:03:54,733 --> 00:03:58,567
His name is Alexis Drazen.
He's Victor Drazen's son.

58
00:03:58,653 --> 00:04:02,009
He was trained in Belgrade. Special Forces.

59
00:04:05,013 --> 00:04:07,004
Good work.

60
00:04:13,133 --> 00:04:15,647
- Hello?
- It's me.

61
00:04:15,733 --> 00:04:18,725
I wanted to tell you we're not
leaving town today after all.

62
00:04:18,813 --> 00:04:21,771
Well, what made the senator
decide to change his plans?

63
00:04:21,853 --> 00:04:25,971
He didn't say and I didn't ask. I was just
happy I would get to see you again so soon.

64
00:04:26,053 --> 00:04:28,647
Well, I'm leaving a meeting right now.

65
00:04:29,053 --> 00:04:33,126
But I can be back at the hotel by 4.30.

66
00:04:33,213 --> 00:04:35,886
- OK. I know where to find you.
- OK.

67
00:04:45,133 --> 00:04:48,091
10-98, can you give me a delta check?

68
00:04:48,173 --> 00:04:52,610
This is Daniels. I'm in position.
Touch your ear if you hear me.

69
00:04:55,853 --> 00:04:58,162
Paulson, do you read me?

70
00:04:58,253 --> 00:05:00,244
Yeah.

71
00:05:03,293 --> 00:05:05,966
Breeher, talk to me.
How you lookin'?

72
00:05:06,053 --> 00:05:09,045
It's quiet on my end.

73
00:05:19,693 --> 00:05:22,253
Paulson. Yeah, Jack, hold on.

74
00:05:27,453 --> 00:05:29,444
Excuse me, Mrs. Bauer.

75
00:05:32,813 --> 00:05:34,804
- It's Jack.
- Thank you.

76
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:44,688
- Jack?
- How you doing?

77
00:05:44,773 --> 00:05:48,561
I'm doing OK. Just trying to get some rest.

78
00:05:48,653 --> 00:05:51,884
Look, I couldn't help feeling
after I hung up that...

79
00:05:51,973 --> 00:05:54,646
I don't know, that something was wrong.

80
00:05:54,733 --> 00:05:56,724
No, I'm fine.

81
00:05:59,573 --> 00:06:01,962
A lot's happened, and...

82
00:06:03,053 --> 00:06:06,170
- I really need to talk to you.
- Fine, then let's talk.

83
00:06:06,253 --> 00:06:09,245
- No, not now. Now's not the time.
- Why not?

84
00:06:12,253 --> 00:06:17,168
You do what you have to do and
we'll talk when this is all over, OK?

85
00:06:18,933 --> 00:06:20,924
OK.

86
00:06:21,653 --> 00:06:24,611
I'm here at CTU if you need me.

87
00:06:24,693 --> 00:06:26,684
I know.

88
00:06:27,893 --> 00:06:29,406
OK. Bye.

89
00:06:36,453 --> 00:06:40,128
Folks, I know you're all busy,
so I'll be as brief as I can be.

90
00:06:40,213 --> 00:06:43,091
- Good. You're just in time.
- What's going on?

91
00:06:43,173 --> 00:06:46,131
Bauer sent over photos
of the people targeting you.

92
00:06:46,213 --> 00:06:50,047
The threat against Senator Palmer
remains a high probability.

93
00:06:50,133 --> 00:06:54,729
But we have gotten a significant piece
of heads-up intelligence.

94
00:06:56,413 --> 00:06:58,802
These three men...

95
00:07:00,813 --> 00:07:03,566
are the suspected shooters.

96
00:07:03,653 --> 00:07:06,531
Now, since you're all on
the front line of this campaign,

97
00:07:06,613 --> 00:07:09,491
we're hoping you can expand
our surveillance reach.

98
00:07:10,893 --> 00:07:13,805
We can always use more
eyes and ears in the field.

99
00:07:13,893 --> 00:07:17,966
If you see anyone who you suspect
as being one of these people,

100
00:07:18,053 --> 00:07:20,965
let an agent know immediately.

101
00:07:21,653 --> 00:07:25,851
- Everybody clear on that?
- Elizabeth, what's wrong?

102
00:07:25,933 --> 00:07:29,687
- OK, but the fact is, Rick ran away.
- He was scared.

103
00:07:29,773 --> 00:07:31,764
Apparently.

104
00:07:34,853 --> 00:07:38,243
Any explanation he has doesn't
change the fact he's a fugitive.

105
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:41,769
If you know where he is
and aren't telling us, that constitutes...

106
00:07:41,853 --> 00:07:45,323
- I don't know where he is.
- Are you sure?

107
00:07:45,413 --> 00:07:47,722
What I am sure of is that he helped us escape

108
00:07:47,813 --> 00:07:51,806
and if it wasn't for him,
we would have never got out of there.

109
00:07:53,173 --> 00:07:55,164
Kim...

110
00:07:56,613 --> 00:07:59,081
When people are taken hostage,

111
00:07:59,173 --> 00:08:04,372
it's not uncommon for them to feel
a certain bond with their kidnappers.

112
00:08:04,453 --> 00:08:07,206
Rick isn't a kidnapper.

113
00:08:07,293 --> 00:08:09,761
And anyway, I don't know where he is.

114
00:08:10,853 --> 00:08:14,129
Oh, I'm sorry, Nina.
I thought you were finished.

115
00:08:14,213 --> 00:08:18,286
Um... whenever you're ready,
we can pick up where we left off.

116
00:08:19,013 --> 00:08:21,004
OK. Um...

117
00:08:21,813 --> 00:08:26,091
Why don't you take a break,
and your mother and I can finish up in here.

118
00:08:30,773 --> 00:08:32,764
You OK?

119
00:08:35,053 --> 00:08:38,568
- Sure you're OK to do this?
- Yeah, sure. Are you?

120
00:08:39,013 --> 00:08:40,446
Yeah.

121
00:08:40,533 --> 00:08:42,888
Listen, Nina, um...

122
00:08:43,933 --> 00:08:46,731
I don't want you to have to tiptoe around me.

123
00:08:48,013 --> 00:08:51,688
Jack and I were separated
when you slept with him.

124
00:08:51,773 --> 00:08:54,845
I'm not gonna hold that against you, OK?

125
00:09:05,653 --> 00:09:07,644
OK, um...

126
00:09:08,573 --> 00:09:11,883
You and Kim have both said
that Rick helped you.

127
00:09:12,813 --> 00:09:17,807
But talking to Kim, I get the sense
that she's withholding something.

128
00:09:18,813 --> 00:09:20,804
Based on what?

129
00:09:21,533 --> 00:09:24,650
She's protecting Rick.
She seems to have feelings for him,

130
00:09:24,733 --> 00:09:26,610
from what I can tell.

131
00:09:26,693 --> 00:09:30,129
Well, there may have been an attraction
when she met him last night,

132
00:09:30,213 --> 00:09:33,171
but if Kimberly knew anything
I'm sure she'd tell you.

133
00:09:33,253 --> 00:09:34,891
Are you sure about that?

134
00:09:34,973 --> 00:09:38,283
She's my daughter. I think
I know her better than you.

135
00:09:45,773 --> 00:09:48,571
- Bauer.
- It's David Palmer.

136
00:09:48,653 --> 00:09:51,451
- Sir, is everything all right?
- I'm not sure.

137
00:09:51,533 --> 00:09:53,364
What's going on?

138
00:09:53,453 --> 00:09:56,684
A member of my advance team,
Elizabeth Nash,

139
00:09:56,773 --> 00:10:00,766
she recognised one of the assassins
in the photos you sent Secret Service.

140
00:10:00,853 --> 00:10:03,208
It's Victor Drazen's son, Alexis.

141
00:10:03,293 --> 00:10:06,205
- Does she know where he is?
- They're in contact.

142
00:10:06,293 --> 00:10:09,126
"Contact"? What do you mean?
In which context?

143
00:10:10,653 --> 00:10:12,644
Intimate.

144
00:10:13,773 --> 00:10:18,449
Senator, is this person in a position
to endanger your security?

145
00:10:19,773 --> 00:10:24,244
I'm afraid so. Look, she's pretty shaken up,
but she wants to help.

146
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:27,131
Good. We have to bring her in
to CTU and question her.

147
00:10:27,213 --> 00:10:29,363
We'll get a helicopter over to you.

148
00:10:29,453 --> 00:10:35,369
I'll have her ready. Oh, what about Ellis? Did
he retrieve the file on Operation Nightfall?

149
00:10:35,453 --> 00:10:38,968
- I lost contact with Ellis.
- "Lost contact"? What do you mean?

150
00:10:39,053 --> 00:10:44,446
We got interrupted in the middle of our phone
call. Sir, I've got a very bad feeling about this.

151
00:10:44,533 --> 00:10:48,765
- So what are you telling me?
- For now, we have to assume Ellis is dead.

152
00:10:51,013 --> 00:10:53,083
- Keep me posted.
- Yes, sir.

153
00:10:55,173 --> 00:10:58,085
Milo, get me chopper command.

154
00:11:20,693 --> 00:11:23,605
- Hello?
- Rick, it's Kim.

155
00:11:23,693 --> 00:11:27,652
- Hey.
- This woman here, she's really pushing me.

156
00:11:27,733 --> 00:11:30,850
- What'd you tell her?
- The truth. That you helped us escape.

157
00:11:30,933 --> 00:11:33,766
Well, that's really gonna save my ass.

158
00:11:35,053 --> 00:11:37,931
I'm sorry. I'm a little edgy right now.

159
00:11:38,013 --> 00:11:41,085
I just think, if you tell her
what happened, it'll work out.

160
00:11:41,173 --> 00:11:42,765
She won't believe me.

161
00:11:42,853 --> 00:11:45,492
I don't know how much longer
I can cover for you.

162
00:11:45,573 --> 00:11:48,292
OK, OK. Can she prove anything?

163
00:11:48,373 --> 00:11:50,364
I don't think so.

164
00:11:50,453 --> 00:11:52,364
Well, that's all that matters.

165
00:11:52,453 --> 00:11:56,924
Listen, I appreciate what you're doing and all,
but you probably shouldn't call here.

166
00:11:57,013 --> 00:11:59,322
- At least not for a while.
- How long?

167
00:11:59,413 --> 00:12:01,404
I dunno. I gotta...

168
00:12:03,853 --> 00:12:06,572
- Who's that?
- I don't know. Just a wrong number.

169
00:12:09,973 --> 00:12:13,522
I'm worked. I'm gonna crash for a while, OK?

170
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:36,890
So is there anything else
you can tell me about Gaines?

171
00:12:36,973 --> 00:12:39,965
Maybe a conversation you overheard?

172
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:45,932
- Who's Gaines?
- Ira Gaines, the leader of the group.

173
00:12:46,013 --> 00:12:48,004
Right.

174
00:12:50,573 --> 00:12:53,087
- Teri...
- Nina, I'm fine.

175
00:12:53,173 --> 00:12:54,891
Maybe we should take a break.

176
00:12:54,973 --> 00:12:58,966
Maybe you should do your job, Nina.
Don't you have a job to do?

177
00:12:59,693 --> 00:13:01,365
I wish it were that simple.

178
00:13:01,453 --> 00:13:05,446
Things tend to get complicated
when you screw your boss.

179
00:13:06,493 --> 00:13:08,882
Look, this obviously isn't working.

180
00:13:08,973 --> 00:13:10,964
No, it's not.

181
00:13:12,213 --> 00:13:16,809
I'm sorry. I thought I could stay calm and
rational about this, but I can't do it. I'm sorry.

182
00:13:16,893 --> 00:13:21,728
There's no apology needed,
but I think Paulson should finish up here.

183
00:13:33,653 --> 00:13:36,292
George. What are you doing here?

184
00:13:36,813 --> 00:13:39,407
- I'm the new quarterback.
- Since when?

185
00:13:39,733 --> 00:13:42,964
- Since right now.
- What about Alberta Green?

186
00:13:43,053 --> 00:13:45,044
Back at District.

187
00:13:46,133 --> 00:13:50,649
So Chapelle thought you'd do a better job
keeping an eye on me than she would.

188
00:13:50,733 --> 00:13:54,362
I dunno, Jack. Something like that, I guess.

189
00:13:58,573 --> 00:14:02,532
So, it's really Drazen's boys
that are after Palmer, huh?

190
00:14:02,613 --> 00:14:05,889
This whole thing is a revenge play
for killing their father.

191
00:14:05,973 --> 00:14:10,046
I know why they're gunning for you,
but why are they after Palmer?

192
00:14:11,093 --> 00:14:16,326
Senator Palmer was head of the
subcommittee that authorised the mission.

193
00:14:16,413 --> 00:14:20,964
- You got Ellis tracking down the file on that?
- I had Ellis.

194
00:14:21,053 --> 00:14:23,089
I lost contact with him 20 minutes ago.

195
00:14:23,173 --> 00:14:25,607
You think they took him out?

196
00:14:25,693 --> 00:14:29,242
Yes, I do. We got a break
on another front, though.

197
00:14:30,013 --> 00:14:33,289
A Ms Elizabeth Nash,
part of the senator's advance team,

198
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:37,286
identified one of the shooters from
photos I sent over. She'd been dating him.

199
00:14:37,373 --> 00:14:42,083
She had no idea who he was. She's shaken up
but she's on her way here for a debriefing.

200
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:44,482
Which one of 'em was she seeing?

201
00:14:45,373 --> 00:14:49,651
Alexis Drazen. She's supposed to
meet him in his hotel room in an hour.

202
00:14:49,733 --> 00:14:52,122
Good. That'll give us time to stage an arrest.

203
00:14:52,213 --> 00:14:57,845
Think about this. What if she keeps her date?
We'd have the upper hand for the first time.

204
00:14:57,933 --> 00:15:00,003
- See what we could learn.
- It's risky.

205
00:15:00,093 --> 00:15:05,565
I'd have a squad across the hall ready to go
into that room before anything could happen.

206
00:15:06,493 --> 00:15:10,406
George, I think this is too big
an opportunity just to pass up.

207
00:15:12,693 --> 00:15:15,287
- What time is she getting here?
- Ten minutes.

208
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:20,366
- We'll talk to her, then make up our minds.
- Absolutely.

209
00:15:25,453 --> 00:15:28,809
- She's going to the CTU office.
- Why are they taking her there?

210
00:15:28,893 --> 00:15:31,691
They wanna find out all they can
about this Alexis Drazen.

211
00:15:31,773 --> 00:15:35,209
- Is that the brother?
- No, it's his son.

212
00:15:35,293 --> 00:15:38,490
- Hey, let me call you back.
- All right. I'll wait for your call.

213
00:15:38,573 --> 00:15:40,564
Keith, come in.

214
00:15:43,933 --> 00:15:45,571
What's up?

215
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:51,011
We haven't had much chance to talk since
last night, and it seems like every time we do,

216
00:15:51,093 --> 00:15:53,402
we're at each other's throats.

217
00:15:53,493 --> 00:15:56,485
Everything's OK between you and me.

218
00:15:57,693 --> 00:16:01,447
I guess you've noticed that we haven't
been quite on the same page today.

219
00:16:01,533 --> 00:16:03,808
It has been kinda hard to miss.

220
00:16:03,893 --> 00:16:06,885
The pressure's on. It's testing all of us.

221
00:16:08,373 --> 00:16:10,125
For sure.

222
00:16:10,493 --> 00:16:12,370
That's what I wanted to talk about.

223
00:16:14,493 --> 00:16:17,963
It stayed in my head,
what you said a couple of hours ago.

224
00:16:19,373 --> 00:16:24,447
About how Dr Ferragamo was always there
when you needed someone, and I wasn't.

225
00:16:24,533 --> 00:16:28,287
I'm sorry. But that's just how it was then.

226
00:16:30,253 --> 00:16:32,448
That's all gonna change.

227
00:16:33,373 --> 00:16:35,364
Starting now.

228
00:16:36,773 --> 00:16:39,970
I know I can't earn your trust overnight.

229
00:16:40,373 --> 00:16:45,288
But if you just come to me when
you need to talk, I promise you, son,

230
00:16:46,653 --> 00:16:48,644
I'll always be there.

231
00:16:53,133 --> 00:16:55,044
Thanks, Dad.

232
00:16:58,493 --> 00:17:02,281
So what about Dr Ferragamo?
Did the police say anything?

233
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:06,162
We haven't called yet.

234
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:10,929
- What are we waiting for?
- We're not putting anything off, Keith.

235
00:17:11,013 --> 00:17:16,371
It's just something else has come up. Listen
to me. We have a security breach on our staff.

236
00:17:16,453 --> 00:17:18,762
We have to deal with that first.

237
00:17:18,853 --> 00:17:20,730
What kind of security breach?

238
00:17:23,173 --> 00:17:25,403
- I can't tell you.
- You can't tell me anything.

239
00:17:25,493 --> 00:17:30,169
Look, Keith, I have to be able to make
decisions without you challenging me.

240
00:17:30,253 --> 00:17:34,531
Look, everything you're feeling...
Now's the time I need you, Dad.

241
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:38,129
Not just to talk to me,
but to do the right thing.

242
00:17:40,813 --> 00:17:43,452
Keith... Keith!

243
00:17:44,053 --> 00:17:48,365
I will do the right thing... at the right time.

244
00:17:49,573 --> 00:17:52,133
Yeah, I'm sure you will.

245
00:17:59,213 --> 00:18:02,762
I've found Bauer's wife and daughter.
They were moved to a safe house.

246
00:18:02,853 --> 00:18:06,084
- Where are you?
- I'm almost in.

247
00:18:06,813 --> 00:18:09,373
How many men are guarding them?

248
00:18:09,453 --> 00:18:15,130
I'm handling the situation, Andre. Rest
assured, the women will be dead soon.

249
00:18:15,213 --> 00:18:17,807
Call me the minute it's done.

250
00:19:07,213 --> 00:19:10,091
- Milo, can you help me out with something?
- Yeah.

251
00:19:10,173 --> 00:19:15,122
What's wrong with the system? My terminal's
locked. I just downloaded all my files to here.

252
00:19:15,213 --> 00:19:16,885
Dammit!

253
00:19:16,973 --> 00:19:19,965
Whoa, just hold on a second. Let me see.

254
00:19:22,413 --> 00:19:25,132
Why can't I log in?

255
00:19:25,213 --> 00:19:28,523
- What, you mean Mason didn't tell you?
- Tell me what?

256
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:34,327
They downgraded your privileges to 3W.
You're the same as everyone else down here.

257
00:19:34,413 --> 00:19:36,802
I see.

258
00:19:36,893 --> 00:19:41,409
Look, here. This should
get you into anything you need.

259
00:19:41,493 --> 00:19:42,926
Thanks.

260
00:19:43,013 --> 00:19:46,289
Jack, don't worry. You'll be back
in your office by tomorrow.

261
00:19:46,373 --> 00:19:49,649
- By tomorrow I'll be in federal custody.
- But why...

262
00:19:49,733 --> 00:19:55,524
I'm only on provisional status for the day.
When Palmer leaves the state, I face charges.

263
00:19:56,093 --> 00:19:58,084
Yeah.

264
00:19:59,253 --> 00:20:02,882
I'm sorry. Look, you're all set here. Just...

265
00:20:02,973 --> 00:20:04,964
Thanks.

266
00:20:06,693 --> 00:20:08,490
- Milo?
- Yeah?

267
00:20:11,653 --> 00:20:14,804
Have you noticed anyone accessing
anything unusual on the servers?

268
00:20:14,893 --> 00:20:16,121
What do you mean?

269
00:20:16,213 --> 00:20:20,570
I don't know. Anything received
or relating to sensitive intel.

270
00:20:20,653 --> 00:20:23,611
No, but I haven't been looking for it.

271
00:20:24,813 --> 00:20:26,087
Start looking.

272
00:20:26,533 --> 00:20:29,001
Wait, you think there's
another mole inside CTU?

273
00:20:29,093 --> 00:20:31,846
I don't know. Just let me know
if you find anything, OK?

274
00:20:31,933 --> 00:20:33,924
OK.

275
00:20:36,893 --> 00:20:39,612
- All I'm saying is, don't test me.
- I'm not.

276
00:20:39,693 --> 00:20:41,968
- I will do what I said!
- Keith...

277
00:20:42,053 --> 00:20:45,125
I'm serious. I have nothing
left to lose. Not any more.

278
00:20:45,213 --> 00:20:46,931
- You're upset...
- That's right.

279
00:20:47,013 --> 00:20:49,481
- OK, we should talk.
- I'm glad you understand.

280
00:20:49,573 --> 00:20:52,371
- You know the Griffith Park Observatory?
- Yeah.

281
00:20:52,453 --> 00:20:54,409
Can you meet me there now?

282
00:20:54,493 --> 00:20:57,565
Yeah, I can be there. 15 minutes.

283
00:20:59,213 --> 00:21:01,363
- Be where?
- Nowhere.

284
00:21:01,453 --> 00:21:03,409
- Keith...
- I'm trying to protect you.

285
00:21:03,493 --> 00:21:06,087
The last time you tried
to protect me, someone died.

286
00:21:06,173 --> 00:21:08,368
Nicole, please.

287
00:21:08,453 --> 00:21:11,013
I'm sorry. That was a terrible thing to say.

288
00:21:11,093 --> 00:21:14,768
- The less you know...
- Who were you talking to on the phone?

289
00:21:15,533 --> 00:21:18,923
- You trust me, don't you?
- Trust goes both ways, Keith.

290
00:21:20,813 --> 00:21:22,804
Carl.

291
00:21:23,533 --> 00:21:24,602
Why?

292
00:21:24,693 --> 00:21:28,322
I don't wanna spend my life with the same
regret I've had for the past seven years.

293
00:21:28,413 --> 00:21:32,372
- You didn't kill Gibson intentionally.
- But I kept the truth from coming out.

294
00:21:32,453 --> 00:21:35,126
And now, with Dr Ferragamo dead...

295
00:21:35,213 --> 00:21:38,888
Look, I can't do that again, Nicole.
I won't. And I need your help.

296
00:21:38,973 --> 00:21:41,441
For what?

297
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:44,605
Listen, this Secret Service guy's
been dogging me all day.

298
00:21:44,693 --> 00:21:47,161
- Help me get past him.
- He's here to protect us.

299
00:21:47,253 --> 00:21:51,007
Everything that's been happening today,
everything that's still happening.

300
00:21:51,093 --> 00:21:54,483
It's not too late to change
the way this all plays out.

301
00:21:57,013 --> 00:21:59,607
Now, do you trust me or not?

302
00:22:03,093 --> 00:22:05,084
OK. Good. OK.

303
00:22:05,173 --> 00:22:07,164
All right.

304
00:22:21,773 --> 00:22:26,324
Excuse me. I was on the phone
and I heard a clicking sound,

305
00:22:26,413 --> 00:22:30,884
and I'm wondering if that's my dad being
bugged or if I'm just being paranoid.

306
00:22:30,973 --> 00:22:33,965
Well, why don't we
just go check it out?

307
00:23:05,973 --> 00:23:08,123
Victor Drazen had two sons.

308
00:23:08,213 --> 00:23:13,003
We know Alexis Drazen is here. I think we
should assume Andre Drazen is here as well.

309
00:23:13,093 --> 00:23:18,167
- With at least two other shooters, right?
- Potentially a third, assuming Ellis is dead.

310
00:23:18,253 --> 00:23:20,687
Here she comes.

311
00:23:24,853 --> 00:23:29,529
Miss Nash? George Mason, District Director.
This is Agent Jack Bauer.

312
00:23:29,613 --> 00:23:32,332
Mr. Bauer. Senator Palmer told me about you.

313
00:23:32,413 --> 00:23:36,406
He said I should do whatever you tell me
and I could be sure I'd be in good hands.

314
00:23:36,493 --> 00:23:41,169
I appreciate that. I have to tell you if you
wish a lawyer present, you're entitled to that,

315
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:45,292
but we in no way consider you a suspect.
We just wanna ask you a few questions.

316
00:23:45,373 --> 00:23:49,332
I don't need a lawyer.
I'll cooperate in any way I can.

317
00:23:49,413 --> 00:23:51,404
Come on in.

318
00:23:55,533 --> 00:23:59,446
- Can I have something to drink?
- I'll get you a glass of water.

319
00:24:02,333 --> 00:24:04,642
So...

320
00:24:04,733 --> 00:24:07,805
how did Alexis Drazen
represent himself to you?

321
00:24:07,893 --> 00:24:11,681
He told me he ran
an importing company out of Berlin.

322
00:24:13,013 --> 00:24:16,085
He seemed successful.
He gave me this on our third date.

323
00:24:16,173 --> 00:24:21,964
It must have cost him $10,000. It's real,
which is more than I can say for him.

324
00:24:23,373 --> 00:24:27,082
- When did you meet him?
- About a month ago, in DC.

325
00:24:27,173 --> 00:24:29,846
I'm with the senator's advance team.

326
00:24:29,933 --> 00:24:33,209
We had some downtime
and a few of us went out for drinks.

327
00:24:33,293 --> 00:24:35,761
So you met him in a bar?

328
00:24:36,893 --> 00:24:41,921
When you're working on a campaign you
basically put your life on hold for a year.

329
00:24:42,013 --> 00:24:44,891
There's always people around, but it's lonely.

330
00:24:46,333 --> 00:24:50,451
You're supposed to meet Mr. Drazen
in his hotel room in about an hour?

331
00:24:50,533 --> 00:24:52,569
That's right.

332
00:24:52,653 --> 00:24:54,644
Miss Nash...

333
00:24:55,813 --> 00:24:59,408
Would you be willing to keep
your appointment with Alexis?

334
00:24:59,493 --> 00:25:02,803
- You want me to spy on him?
- Well, only if you feel comfortable.

335
00:25:02,893 --> 00:25:06,602
- If you have any doubts at all...
- We'd keep it simple.

336
00:25:06,693 --> 00:25:11,084
We want you to plant a tracking device
on him, so we can trace his locations.

337
00:25:14,253 --> 00:25:16,721
It's just the thought of seeing him again.

338
00:25:16,813 --> 00:25:21,091
We would make it so that we could hear and
see everything that took place in that room.

339
00:25:21,173 --> 00:25:23,164
You would be safe.

340
00:25:25,133 --> 00:25:30,253
It's OK. We understand. Jack, you head over
to the hotel. I'll finish debriefing Miss Nash.

341
00:25:30,333 --> 00:25:32,051
Yeah.

342
00:25:35,213 --> 00:25:39,331
Mr. Bauer? You say that this
might help protect the senator?

343
00:25:41,733 --> 00:25:43,086
Yes, I think it would.

344
00:25:43,173 --> 00:25:46,927
The senator is safe. He's got Secret Service
men with him around the clock.

345
00:25:47,013 --> 00:25:51,245
That didn't stop Alexis from getting to me,
did it? And if they got to me,

346
00:25:51,333 --> 00:25:54,052
they might have got to somebody else.

347
00:25:57,733 --> 00:26:01,692
I'll do it. If something happened to Senator
Palmer that I might have prevented,

348
00:26:01,773 --> 00:26:04,651
I could never forgive myself. Please.

349
00:26:04,733 --> 00:26:06,803
I have to do this.

350
00:26:12,893 --> 00:26:17,011
He looks familiar too.
I think I heard them call him Jenson.

351
00:26:20,133 --> 00:26:22,124
Recognise him?

352
00:26:26,333 --> 00:26:28,608
How about him?

353
00:26:31,293 --> 00:26:33,284
You know this one?

354
00:26:35,733 --> 00:26:37,212
Yeah.

355
00:26:38,853 --> 00:26:42,562
He was one of the guards.
I think they called him Eli.

356
00:26:43,253 --> 00:26:46,563
- Can you tell me anything about him?
- No.

357
00:26:58,253 --> 00:27:00,448
Daniels, this is Breeher.

358
00:27:03,613 --> 00:27:06,002
Daniels, this is Breeher.

359
00:27:27,213 --> 00:27:31,092
These rooms with monitors -
they had your father under surveillance?

360
00:27:31,173 --> 00:27:34,210
- From what I saw.
- Even at CTU?

361
00:27:35,773 --> 00:27:38,765
- I don't know.
- What about you, Mrs. Bauer?

362
00:27:40,973 --> 00:27:42,964
Mrs. Bauer?

363
00:27:43,733 --> 00:27:48,443
- It's important we get through the questions.
- Agent Paulson, I think we need a break.

364
00:27:48,533 --> 00:27:51,525
- My mom's very tired.
- Yeah, OK.

365
00:28:04,173 --> 00:28:06,164
Mom, are you OK?

366
00:28:14,173 --> 00:28:16,164
Mom?

367
00:28:36,573 --> 00:28:38,564
Ron?

368
00:28:42,293 --> 00:28:44,284
Ron?

369
00:28:54,373 --> 00:28:57,888
- Come with me. Go. Go. Shh. Let's go.
- Mom...

370
00:29:03,733 --> 00:29:06,122
- Come on. Go. Go.
- Come on.

371
00:29:10,533 --> 00:29:12,524
In here.

372
00:29:15,773 --> 00:29:17,968
Lock the door.

373
00:29:38,933 --> 00:29:42,005
- Come out. Hands where I can see them.
- Don't shoot. I'm coming out.

374
00:29:42,093 --> 00:29:45,130
- Now!
- I'm coming out.

375
00:29:45,213 --> 00:29:47,204
Drop the gun.

376
00:29:48,213 --> 00:29:50,204
Get down. Down!

377
00:29:58,013 --> 00:30:00,004
Hurry.

378
00:30:12,693 --> 00:30:15,366
Go. Go. Go! Go! Go!

379
00:30:16,973 --> 00:30:19,043
Get down!

380
00:30:19,133 --> 00:30:20,964
Look out!

381
00:30:31,933 --> 00:30:33,924
Honey, get down!

382
00:30:52,253 --> 00:30:53,971
We're ready to go, gentlemen.

383
00:30:54,053 --> 00:30:57,728
I'll fill you in with the rest at the hotel.
That's where you'll meet the team.

384
00:30:57,813 --> 00:31:00,611
Don't be nervous.
I'll be with you every step of the way.

385
00:31:00,693 --> 00:31:02,285
Jack, I gotta talk to you.

386
00:31:02,373 --> 00:31:05,968
Secret Service will take you to the helicopter.
I'll be there in one second.

387
00:31:06,053 --> 00:31:07,122
What?

388
00:31:07,213 --> 00:31:11,411
They just found Ellis's body
in a men's room in the French Quarter.

389
00:31:14,093 --> 00:31:16,527
- Do we have any leads yet?
- No, not yet.

390
00:31:20,693 --> 00:31:22,684
Keep me posted.

391
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:27,328
What are you doing here?

392
00:31:27,413 --> 00:31:32,407
- I'd no reason to stay. Teri and Kim are fine.
- I asked you to stay to make them feel safe.

393
00:31:32,493 --> 00:31:35,769
They are safe. I settled them in.
Paulson's taking care of them

394
00:31:35,853 --> 00:31:38,413
and the extra security team is in place.

395
00:32:03,093 --> 00:32:05,084
Hang on, Kim.

396
00:32:33,973 --> 00:32:36,328
- You OK, honey?
- Yeah.

397
00:32:36,413 --> 00:32:40,486
I think we lost 'em. I'm just gonna go check.
I want you to stay right here, OK?

398
00:32:40,573 --> 00:32:43,087
- Yeah.
- Stay right here.

399
00:32:55,373 --> 00:32:57,523
Argh!

400
00:33:52,133 --> 00:33:55,045
- He's dead, isn't he? Ferragamo's dead.
- I have no idea.

401
00:33:55,133 --> 00:33:58,682
- Don't try to blow me off, Carl.
- The authorities are looking into it.

402
00:33:58,773 --> 00:34:02,288
- They won't find anything!
- I've gone through this with your father...

403
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:05,729
My father is his own man, and so am I.
So you can go through it with me!

404
00:34:05,813 --> 00:34:08,611
Let's just go. What do you need?
Tell me what you need.

405
00:34:08,693 --> 00:34:13,687
Ferragamo was there for me when nobody
else was. I might not be alive if not for him.

406
00:34:13,773 --> 00:34:18,244
He also betrayed your confidence, Keith.
He's the one who went to Maureen Kingsley.

407
00:34:18,333 --> 00:34:22,087
- That doesn't justify murder.
- What exactly are you hoping to do?

408
00:34:22,173 --> 00:34:24,084
- Bring him back to life?
- I want justice.

409
00:34:24,173 --> 00:34:27,768
Justice? Well, justice is a tricky thing, Keith.

410
00:34:28,373 --> 00:34:32,002
Take Lyle Gibson, for example.
You want justice for that?

411
00:34:32,973 --> 00:34:37,091
- Gibson's death was an accident.
- Maybe so, but let's be objective.

412
00:34:37,173 --> 00:34:42,645
He rapes your sister, you pay him a visit, he
ends up dead. Accident could be a tough sell.

413
00:34:44,813 --> 00:34:49,887
If I go public with the truth about Ferragamo,
you'll go public with a lie about Gibson.

414
00:34:49,973 --> 00:34:52,646
Is that what you're saying?

415
00:34:52,733 --> 00:34:56,009
- Oh, brother.
- There's one catch here, Carl.

416
00:34:56,093 --> 00:35:00,484
There are two cover-ups and you're involved
in both. However it plays out, it's bad for you.

417
00:35:00,573 --> 00:35:02,370
- I can take care of myself.
- No.

418
00:35:02,453 --> 00:35:05,445
The moneymen behind
my father's campaign take care of you.

419
00:35:05,533 --> 00:35:11,802
But if things get ugly they'll make sure you're
the one who takes the fall, won't they, Carl?

420
00:35:12,413 --> 00:35:15,450
Or maybe they'll do to you
what you did to Dr Ferragamo.

421
00:35:15,533 --> 00:35:17,842
You are in way over your head.

422
00:35:18,653 --> 00:35:21,770
And you're getting nervous. I can smell it.

423
00:35:23,293 --> 00:35:28,321
OK, you listen to me. Whatever you think
you can do, to me or anyone else,

424
00:35:28,413 --> 00:35:31,644
it'll be a hundred times worse for you.

425
00:35:31,733 --> 00:35:34,372
- I'm not so sure.
- Well, I am.

426
00:35:34,453 --> 00:35:39,208
Because if you push things too far,
they will do whatever they have to do.

427
00:35:39,293 --> 00:35:41,727
Killing David Palmer's son might get messy.

428
00:35:41,813 --> 00:35:45,249
Oh, I think they'd be
a little more subtle than that.

429
00:35:45,333 --> 00:35:47,324
I'm not following you.

430
00:35:49,493 --> 00:35:53,202
There is some physical evidence
in George Ferragamo's office

431
00:35:53,293 --> 00:35:55,602
that leads directly to you.

432
00:35:55,973 --> 00:35:59,329
Subtle enough so the fire marshals
didn't find it the first time.

433
00:35:59,413 --> 00:36:02,211
But with a little help, they'll find it.

434
00:36:04,173 --> 00:36:08,689
- So I'll be framed for Ferragamo's murder?
- Like I said, whatever it takes.

435
00:36:08,773 --> 00:36:12,971
That's why your father backed off,
and that's why you'll back off.

436
00:36:35,533 --> 00:36:37,683
I'll be framed for Ferragamo's murder?

437
00:36:37,773 --> 00:36:40,412
Like I said, whatever it takes.

438
00:36:40,493 --> 00:36:44,850
That's why your father backed off,
and that's why you’ll back off.

439
00:38:48,013 --> 00:38:50,004
Hey.

440
00:38:50,493 --> 00:38:52,484
Are you OK?

441
00:38:55,493 --> 00:38:57,484
What happened?

442
00:38:59,893 --> 00:39:01,690
What's your name?

443
00:39:03,853 --> 00:39:06,003
I don't remember.

444
00:39:06,853 --> 00:39:09,162
You don't even know your name?

445
00:39:15,973 --> 00:39:18,965
Well, you can't stand
in the middle of the road.

446
00:39:23,453 --> 00:39:26,411
Come on, get in. I'll give you a ride.

447
00:39:26,493 --> 00:39:28,484
Thank you.

448
00:39:40,293 --> 00:39:43,012
I'm sorry. Thank you.

449
00:40:59,733 --> 00:41:01,724
Mom!

450
00:41:03,773 --> 00:41:04,842
Mom!
