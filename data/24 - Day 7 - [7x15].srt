Previously on 24 ...

7
00:00:13,961 --> 00:00:15,695
Ken Dellao, CNB.

8
00:00:15,763 --> 00:00:17,864
I'm wondering if you can
confirm some information.

9
00:00:17,932 --> 00:00:20,199
I'm gonna be reporting

10
00:00:20,267 --> 00:00:21,768
in this evening's
broadcast

11
00:00:21,836 --> 00:00:23,870
that a rogue ex-federal
agent named Jack Bauer

12
00:00:23,938 --> 00:00:26,673
is the prime suspect
in the murder of Ryan Burnett.

13
00:00:26,741 --> 00:00:28,642
You leaked this story
of Burnett's murder

14
00:00:28,709 --> 00:00:30,576
and my involvement
to the press.

15
00:00:30,645 --> 00:00:34,380
So another one of your errors in
judgment bites you on the ass.

16
00:00:34,448 --> 00:00:36,315
You've gone too far this time.

17
00:00:36,383 --> 00:00:38,351
Renee, it's Jack.
Don't hang up the phone, please.

18
00:00:38,418 --> 00:00:40,419
Whatever they told you,
I did not kill Burnett.

19
00:00:40,487 --> 00:00:42,722
I sent you a photo
of the man who did.

20
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:44,724
All I want you to do
is make an ID.

21
00:00:44,792 --> 00:00:47,360
John Quinn,
Black Ops combat vet.

22
00:00:47,427 --> 00:00:48,928
He works for Starkwood.

23
00:00:48,996 --> 00:00:50,096
Starkwood work with Juma?

24
00:00:50,164 --> 00:00:51,665
If they did,
it wasn't on the books.

25
00:00:51,732 --> 00:00:53,833
You know, if anyone knows,
it's Senator Mayer.

26
00:00:53,901 --> 00:00:57,037
Renee, where's Bauer?

27
00:00:57,104 --> 00:00:59,005
I don't know.
Don't you lie
to me.

28
00:00:59,073 --> 00:01:00,206
We know you accessed

29
00:01:00,274 --> 00:01:01,675
a classified
government database

30
00:01:01,742 --> 00:01:03,342
and sent someone's name
and address to Bauer.

31
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:04,544
Tell me where he is.

32
00:01:04,611 --> 00:01:05,712
I can't.

33
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:06,913
Put her in holding.

34
00:01:06,981 --> 00:01:08,915
Mirandize her.

35
00:01:08,983 --> 00:01:10,449
If Bauer connects us to Juma,

36
00:01:10,517 --> 00:01:11,951
it could seriously impede
this operation.

37
00:01:12,019 --> 00:01:13,953
Yes, it could.

38
00:01:14,021 --> 00:01:15,955
Is the shipment on time?

39
00:01:16,023 --> 00:01:18,858
Yes. Due into port
in the next hour.

40
00:01:18,926 --> 00:01:20,226
Once the weapons are deployed,

41
00:01:20,294 --> 00:01:22,228
then it doesn't matter
what Mr. Bauer

42
00:01:22,296 --> 00:01:23,730
or anyone else knows.

43
00:01:23,798 --> 00:01:25,398
I didn't kill Burnett.

44
00:01:25,465 --> 00:01:26,432
This man did.

45
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,767
His name is John Quinn.

46
00:01:27,835 --> 00:01:29,736
He works for Starkwood.

47
00:01:29,804 --> 00:01:31,938
And what does Starkwood have
to do with this?

48
00:01:32,006 --> 00:01:34,140
Your informant claims
that Starkwood was trying

49
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:36,475
to acquire a bioweapon, and
that's your connection to Juma.

50
00:01:36,543 --> 00:01:37,944
You've been trying
to dismantle Starkwood

51
00:01:38,012 --> 00:01:39,478
for the last six months.

52
00:01:39,546 --> 00:01:40,747
If they have
a weapon like this,

53
00:01:40,815 --> 00:01:42,615
you better believe
they intend to use it.

54
00:01:44,651 --> 00:01:46,252
No!

55
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:50,890
Just tell me where the
weapons are coming in.

56
00:01:50,958 --> 00:01:53,159
You're too late.

57
00:01:53,227 --> 00:01:55,595
They're already here.

58
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The following takes place
between 10:00 P.M. and 11:00 P.M.

59
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,834
Sir?

60
00:02:34,902 --> 00:02:37,603
Preliminary sweep
of the immediate area's done.

61
00:02:37,671 --> 00:02:40,295
There's no sign of Bauer.

62
00:02:40,415 --> 00:02:42,108
All right,
widen the grid.

63
00:02:42,176 --> 00:02:44,144
And run down security cameras
around the perimeter, witnesses.

64
00:02:44,211 --> 00:02:45,603
Somebody must
have seen him.

65
00:02:45,723 --> 00:02:47,107
Yes, sir.

66
00:03:00,008 --> 00:03:01,508
Mr. Kanin.

67
00:03:02,797 --> 00:03:04,164
Yes?

68
00:03:04,231 --> 00:03:05,965
Larry Moss is on the line.

69
00:03:06,033 --> 00:03:07,633
Agent Moss,

70
00:03:07,701 --> 00:03:10,270
please tell me
you have Jack Bauer in custody.

71
00:03:10,337 --> 00:03:14,174
I wish that were the case,
Mr. Kanin, but the truth is...

72
00:03:15,309 --> 00:03:18,778
Sir, it's
Senator Mayer.

73
00:03:18,846 --> 00:03:20,546
He's dead.

74
00:03:20,614 --> 00:03:22,415
What?!

75
00:03:22,482 --> 00:03:24,017
He was murdered at his house.

76
00:03:24,084 --> 00:03:25,384
We only found out

77
00:03:25,452 --> 00:03:27,386
that Bauer was on his way
over here a short time ago.

78
00:03:27,454 --> 00:03:28,554
Unfortunately, we
got here too late.

79
00:03:28,622 --> 00:03:29,722
Wait a minute.

80
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:31,808
Are you telling me

81
00:03:31,928 --> 00:03:35,161
that Jack Bauer just killed
a United States Senator?

82
00:03:35,229 --> 00:03:37,563
That's the assumption that
we're working under, yes, sir.

83
00:03:39,499 --> 00:03:42,149
How could you have
let this happen, Agent Moss?!

84
00:03:42,269 --> 00:03:44,304
He had us all
fooled, sir.

85
00:03:44,371 --> 00:03:46,873
I released Jack Bauer
into your custody!

86
00:03:46,941 --> 00:03:49,542
I ordered you to keep him
on a short leash!

87
00:03:49,609 --> 00:03:52,411
No, no. Mr. Kanin, you are not
gonna lay this one at my feet.

88
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:54,221
It was your decision
to give Bauer access to Burnett.

89
00:03:54,341 --> 00:03:57,283
I advised you against it.

90
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,321
Mr. Kanin?

91
00:04:05,025 --> 00:04:06,960
I'm sorry. Uh,

92
00:04:07,027 --> 00:04:09,028
what did you say?

93
00:04:09,096 --> 00:04:11,231
I said, I advised you

94
00:04:11,298 --> 00:04:13,399
against it.

95
00:04:13,467 --> 00:04:16,236
Yes, you did.

96
00:04:18,105 --> 00:04:20,940
Sir, I have teams
sweeping the area.

97
00:04:21,008 --> 00:04:23,109
Just find him, Agent Moss.

98
00:04:23,177 --> 00:04:24,643
Yeah, I will.

99
00:04:45,632 --> 00:04:47,666
Starkwood was involved with
everything that happened today.

100
00:04:47,734 --> 00:04:49,568
They were the ones that
helped Juma and his men

101
00:04:49,636 --> 00:04:51,304
bring down those planes
and attack the White House.

102
00:04:51,372 --> 00:04:53,239
In exchange, they
were allowed to develop

103
00:04:53,307 --> 00:04:55,474
and manufacture
a WMD in Sangala.

104
00:04:55,542 --> 00:04:56,675
It's a bioweapon.

105
00:04:56,743 --> 00:04:58,544
Apparently, it's already here
in the US.

106
00:04:58,612 --> 00:04:59,745
Who else knows about this?

107
00:04:59,813 --> 00:05:01,414
No one.
Senator Mayer and I

108
00:05:01,481 --> 00:05:02,848
were piecing together
the information

109
00:05:02,917 --> 00:05:04,250
right before
he was killed.

110
00:05:04,318 --> 00:05:05,751
You said the weapon's
already here.

111
00:05:05,819 --> 00:05:07,153
Are they in
possession of it?

112
00:05:07,221 --> 00:05:08,888
I don't think so.
The text message I got

113
00:05:08,956 --> 00:05:11,024
off their agent's cell phone
said, "Port of Alexandria,

114
00:05:11,091 --> 00:05:12,825
Lot C, 10:15 p.m."

115
00:05:12,893 --> 00:05:15,028
Why don't we just call the FBI
and lock the whole place down?

116
00:05:15,095 --> 00:05:16,195
Because we're
fugitives, Tony.

117
00:05:16,263 --> 00:05:17,496
No one's going
to believe us.

118
00:05:17,564 --> 00:05:19,465
We need to know exactly
where that weapon is

119
00:05:19,533 --> 00:05:20,800
before we call
anyone else in.

120
00:05:20,867 --> 00:05:23,303
Tony, I need to know
if you're with me on this.

121
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:25,939
Yeah, I'm with you.

122
00:05:26,006 --> 00:05:27,840
Okay. Meet me
at the north end of the port.

123
00:05:27,908 --> 00:05:29,542
There's an access road
right before the main entrance.

124
00:05:29,609 --> 00:05:32,178
All right, I'll be there.

125
00:05:35,515 --> 00:05:37,350
It's over.

126
00:05:37,418 --> 00:05:39,885
Dubaku and Juma are dead.

127
00:05:39,954 --> 00:05:44,290
Everyone responsible
for the terrorist attacks...

128
00:05:44,358 --> 00:05:47,560
responsible for Roger.

129
00:05:47,627 --> 00:05:51,397
Thank God for that.

130
00:05:51,465 --> 00:05:54,200
And there's...
there's something else.

131
00:05:54,268 --> 00:05:57,837
Something good
that's come out of all of this.

132
00:05:57,904 --> 00:05:59,638
Olivia

133
00:05:59,706 --> 00:06:01,640
is here at the White House.

134
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:03,209
Olivia?

135
00:06:03,277 --> 00:06:06,479
She's come home, Henry.

136
00:06:06,546 --> 00:06:11,084
This crisis--
it brought us together.

137
00:06:11,151 --> 00:06:14,487
I've asked her to stay on
as Special Advisor, and...

138
00:06:14,554 --> 00:06:15,955
she's agreed.

139
00:06:16,023 --> 00:06:18,057
Ally...

140
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:19,825
I can't begin to tell you

141
00:06:19,893 --> 00:06:20,994
how happy that makes me.

142
00:06:22,496 --> 00:06:24,864
Me, too.

143
00:06:24,931 --> 00:06:27,100
Sweetheart, I know
that you're tired.

144
00:06:27,167 --> 00:06:28,868
You should get
some rest.

145
00:06:28,935 --> 00:06:31,404
Olivia and I will come
to the hospital

146
00:06:31,472 --> 00:06:33,006
just as soon as we can.

147
00:06:33,073 --> 00:06:35,041
When you can.

148
00:06:35,109 --> 00:06:37,910
I'm not going anywhere.

149
00:06:37,978 --> 00:06:41,180
Give Olivia my love.

150
00:06:41,248 --> 00:06:43,916
Love you.

151
00:06:43,984 --> 00:06:46,019
We love you, too.

152
00:06:53,527 --> 00:06:56,396
The doctors expect him
to make a full recovery.

153
00:06:58,365 --> 00:07:00,900
Henry's a lot tougher
than anyone thought.

154
00:07:02,136 --> 00:07:03,969
Oh, maybe, maybe, maybe,
just maybe,

155
00:07:04,038 --> 00:07:07,040
this day will end
on a positive note.

156
00:07:15,149 --> 00:07:17,283
What is it, Ethan? What's wrong?

157
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:21,854
I'm sorry to have to tell you
this, Madam President,

158
00:07:21,922 --> 00:07:24,490
but Senator Mayer is dead.

159
00:07:24,558 --> 00:07:26,959
What happened?

160
00:07:27,027 --> 00:07:31,064
All evidence points to the fact
that he was murdered

161
00:07:31,131 --> 00:07:32,665
by Jack Bauer.

162
00:07:32,732 --> 00:07:34,733
Bauer?

163
00:07:34,801 --> 00:07:37,070
It's hard to believe, I know.

164
00:07:37,137 --> 00:07:38,938
It-It doesn't make any sense.

165
00:07:39,005 --> 00:07:40,339
After everything

166
00:07:40,407 --> 00:07:41,941
he has done today,

167
00:07:42,008 --> 00:07:43,842
why on earth would he do this?

168
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:46,645
We'll know more

169
00:07:46,713 --> 00:07:48,747
when we find him.

170
00:07:48,815 --> 00:07:50,749
My God.

171
00:07:52,886 --> 00:07:55,654
Madam President,

172
00:07:55,722 --> 00:07:57,557
in light of what's happened,

173
00:07:57,624 --> 00:08:00,259
and for the sake
of your administration,

174
00:08:00,327 --> 00:08:02,128
I'm afraid I have no choice
but to resign

175
00:08:02,196 --> 00:08:03,329
as your Chief of Staff.

176
00:08:03,397 --> 00:08:04,497
Ethan!

177
00:08:04,565 --> 00:08:09,268
Madam President, please,
you need to hear this.

178
00:08:09,336 --> 00:08:12,205
Inevitably, it'll come to light
that I sanctioned

179
00:08:12,272 --> 00:08:15,341
Bauer's release
from custody.

180
00:08:15,409 --> 00:08:18,677
Unless I step down immediately,

181
00:08:18,745 --> 00:08:21,013
the damage to your office,
and you personally,

182
00:08:21,081 --> 00:08:25,351
will be extensive.

183
00:08:25,419 --> 00:08:28,621
Ethan, Olivia has already killed
this story once today.

184
00:08:28,688 --> 00:08:31,190
We can control the damage.

185
00:08:31,258 --> 00:08:32,391
No.

186
00:08:32,459 --> 00:08:36,996
No, not even Olivia
can control it now.

187
00:08:37,063 --> 00:08:40,899
Not after the senator's murder.

188
00:08:42,636 --> 00:08:45,704
The truth is, Madam President,

189
00:08:45,772 --> 00:08:49,008
I didn't do enough
to protect you.

190
00:08:49,075 --> 00:08:51,611
The truth is, I failed you.

191
00:08:51,678 --> 00:08:53,078
And I should

192
00:08:53,147 --> 00:08:55,281
shoulder the blame
for what's happened.

193
00:08:55,349 --> 00:08:57,850
Ethan, really, you're...

194
00:08:57,917 --> 00:08:59,252
you're taking
this too far.

195
00:08:59,319 --> 00:09:01,254
Am I?

196
00:09:01,321 --> 00:09:03,850
I'm not so sure.

197
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:06,192
As your daughter has made
abundantly clear,

198
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:09,562
I have a lot
to answer for.

199
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:13,741
You have done nothing but be
an invaluable advisor to me

200
00:09:13,861 --> 00:09:15,734
and an even
better friend.

201
00:09:15,802 --> 00:09:17,537
I appreciate
you saying that,

202
00:09:17,604 --> 00:09:21,574
Madam President,
but Olivia's right.

203
00:09:21,642 --> 00:09:24,510
The political knives
will be out.

204
00:09:24,578 --> 00:09:27,480
Every decision
I've made will be scrutinized.

205
00:09:27,548 --> 00:09:29,448
There will be calls

206
00:09:29,516 --> 00:09:31,617
for a special
prosecutor.

207
00:09:34,788 --> 00:09:37,956
You're a great woman, Allison.

208
00:09:40,075 --> 00:09:42,895
You have great work yet to do.

209
00:09:42,962 --> 00:09:44,630
I'm a liability

210
00:09:44,698 --> 00:09:47,266
to you now.

211
00:09:47,334 --> 00:09:51,437
Don't let me compromise
your next three years in office.

212
00:09:51,505 --> 00:09:53,272
Don't let me sink

213
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:55,308
your agenda.

214
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:57,677
Our agenda, Ethan.

215
00:10:01,948 --> 00:10:04,016
Yes.

216
00:10:04,084 --> 00:10:06,118
Our agenda.

217
00:10:10,224 --> 00:10:12,157
Trust me, Madam President,

218
00:10:12,226 --> 00:10:15,628
it's the right thing to do.

219
00:10:17,063 --> 00:10:19,699
Accept my resignation.

220
00:10:31,578 --> 00:10:34,647
I'll have a letter on your desk
in the morning.

221
00:10:51,231 --> 00:10:52,765
They're gonna be
here any minute.

222
00:10:52,832 --> 00:10:54,869
We need to narrow
down the search.

223
00:10:54,989 --> 00:10:56,730
If they offloaded it today,

224
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:58,003
it should still be
on the storage dock.

225
00:10:58,071 --> 00:11:00,139
That's still a needle
in a haystack, Jack.

226
00:11:00,206 --> 00:11:02,779
There must be over
a thousand containers in there.

227
00:11:02,899 --> 00:11:04,943
We need to access
the yard's manifest.

228
00:11:05,011 --> 00:11:06,215
What's the security?

229
00:11:06,335 --> 00:11:09,150
I've spotted one Port Authority officer.
That's it?

230
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:10,783
That's it.

231
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:12,217
There's got to be more.

232
00:11:12,286 --> 00:11:13,619
Come on, let's go.

233
00:11:14,888 --> 00:11:16,389
Honey, it'll be fine.

234
00:11:16,456 --> 00:11:18,123
I get relieved in a few hours.

235
00:11:18,191 --> 00:11:20,559
Carl, you know I don't like you
working double shifts.

236
00:11:20,627 --> 00:11:22,295
Well, it was my choice.

237
00:11:22,362 --> 00:11:23,829
And we could use the overtime.

238
00:11:23,897 --> 00:11:25,464
How are the girls?

239
00:11:25,532 --> 00:11:26,799
Kicking like a
chorus line tonight.

240
00:11:26,866 --> 00:11:28,768
They miss their daddy.

241
00:11:28,835 --> 00:11:30,135
What'd the doctor say?

242
00:11:30,203 --> 00:11:31,870
That I'm lucky
it's not triplets.

243
00:11:37,477 --> 00:11:39,478
Honey, let me call you back.

244
00:12:08,342 --> 00:12:11,109
Don't even think about
going for your weapon.

245
00:12:14,113 --> 00:12:16,749
I need the port's manifest.
Where is it?

246
00:12:16,817 --> 00:12:18,384
I'm just a PA cop.

247
00:12:18,452 --> 00:12:19,952
Where is it?

248
00:12:20,019 --> 00:12:22,120
Customs House.

249
00:12:22,188 --> 00:12:24,490
That way.

250
00:12:24,558 --> 00:12:25,891
Let's go.

251
00:12:37,894 --> 00:12:39,094
We on schedule?

252
00:12:39,162 --> 00:12:40,495
We're at the staging area

253
00:12:40,563 --> 00:12:42,497
near the port, sir, but we're
still waiting on Quinn.

254
00:12:42,565 --> 00:12:43,933
He should have
been there by now.

255
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,167
Have you heard from him?

256
00:12:45,235 --> 00:12:47,169
We've tried his cell,
but he's not answering.

257
00:12:48,204 --> 00:12:50,872
If Bauer took out Quinn,

258
00:12:50,941 --> 00:12:52,874
he might have knowledge
of the operation.

259
00:12:52,943 --> 00:12:54,476
Mightn't he?

260
00:12:54,544 --> 00:12:56,545
Should we stand down, sir?

261
00:12:58,048 --> 00:13:00,482
No. Give Quinn
five more minutes,

262
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:02,384
then go in.

263
00:13:02,452 --> 00:13:05,454
Do so with extreme caution

264
00:13:05,521 --> 00:13:06,822
then contact me the minute

265
00:13:06,889 --> 00:13:08,290
that you've secured
the container.

266
00:13:08,358 --> 00:13:09,825
Yes, sir.

267
00:13:09,892 --> 00:13:12,738
Everybody on the board
is here, sir.

268
00:13:13,563 --> 00:13:15,464
You have a worried look, Greg.

269
00:13:15,531 --> 00:13:17,666
It's very tense
in there, sir.

270
00:13:17,733 --> 00:13:19,835
They're six-year-olds, Greg.

271
00:13:19,902 --> 00:13:22,237
And they need
to eat their carrots.

272
00:13:30,395 --> 00:13:35,250
It's been a rough day for
the United States of America.

273
00:13:35,318 --> 00:13:37,152
The White House under siege,

274
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,920
the President taken hostage...

275
00:13:38,989 --> 00:13:40,122
It's especially painful

276
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:41,789
because we know
this didn't have to be.

277
00:13:43,059 --> 00:13:45,427
Fact: the United States military

278
00:13:45,495 --> 00:13:47,196
is strained
to the breaking point.

279
00:13:47,263 --> 00:13:50,399
Fact: reinstatement
of the draft

280
00:13:50,467 --> 00:13:53,268
is off the table
for political reasons.

281
00:13:53,336 --> 00:13:56,305
Fact: the people in this room,
you all control

282
00:13:56,373 --> 00:13:59,708
the largest private army
in the Western hemisphere.

283
00:13:59,775 --> 00:14:01,910
Now, could we have been
of help today?

284
00:14:01,978 --> 00:14:05,114
You bet your ass
we could've been of help!

285
00:14:05,181 --> 00:14:06,781
But they didn't
call us, did they?

286
00:14:06,849 --> 00:14:08,750
No. Instead,

287
00:14:08,818 --> 00:14:10,785
we sit here,
our contracts are canceled,

288
00:14:10,853 --> 00:14:13,788
our soldiers vilified,
our corporate sovereignty

289
00:14:13,856 --> 00:14:15,957
is threatened
by congressional fiat.

290
00:14:16,026 --> 00:14:18,360
Doug, you brokered the deal
with this government.

291
00:14:18,428 --> 00:14:20,195
You were short-sighted

292
00:14:20,263 --> 00:14:21,763
and they don't understand
that the global war

293
00:14:21,831 --> 00:14:23,765
on terror can
only be won

294
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:25,000
by forces like ours.

295
00:14:25,068 --> 00:14:26,968
So as of this
minute, we sit

296
00:14:27,037 --> 00:14:28,603
for no more depositions.

297
00:14:28,671 --> 00:14:30,105
We volunteer
no more documents.

298
00:14:30,173 --> 00:14:31,440
I don't even want us to take

299
00:14:31,508 --> 00:14:33,275
any phone calls.
Is that what this is about?

300
00:14:33,343 --> 00:14:35,677
With the security of our country, ...
Is that what this is about?

301
00:14:35,745 --> 00:14:37,379
we cannot afford to let
them take us down.

302
00:14:37,447 --> 00:14:38,813
Is that what
this is about then?

303
00:14:38,881 --> 00:14:40,982
You came here

304
00:14:41,051 --> 00:14:44,453
to ask the board to risk
a federal indictment?

305
00:14:44,521 --> 00:14:46,255
It won't work, Jonas.

306
00:14:46,322 --> 00:14:47,923
We got a deal.

307
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:50,926
It's a good deal and
we're lucky to have it.

308
00:14:50,993 --> 00:14:53,328
With an administration
that wants to destroy us.

309
00:14:53,396 --> 00:14:54,763
Wants to take us
out of business.

310
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:56,932
No, it's all different now.

311
00:14:56,999 --> 00:14:58,100
Today was
a game-changer.

312
00:14:58,168 --> 00:15:00,135
No, institutionally,

313
00:15:00,203 --> 00:15:02,337
we are in compliance
with the subpoena.

314
00:15:02,405 --> 00:15:03,472
Documents have
been filed,

315
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,806
depositions taken.

316
00:15:04,874 --> 00:15:05,974
Not anymore.

317
00:15:06,042 --> 00:15:08,510
Jonas, we have to stay
engaged with this

318
00:15:08,578 --> 00:15:11,012
administration.
No, we don't, Doug.

319
00:15:11,081 --> 00:15:12,448
So look, you and I
can talk this out.

320
00:15:12,515 --> 00:15:14,583
If you guys
have any questions,

321
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:15,684
any further questions,
Greg, you will

322
00:15:15,751 --> 00:15:17,252
stick around
and you'll answer them.

323
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,487
Thank you for coming everyone.

324
00:15:18,555 --> 00:15:19,888
Thank you.

325
00:15:26,829 --> 00:15:29,398
Your way was
a mistake, Doug.

326
00:15:29,466 --> 00:15:31,100
You have to
acknowledge that.

327
00:15:31,167 --> 00:15:34,136
Maybe. But you
and I both know

328
00:15:34,204 --> 00:15:35,504
that Starkwood cannot survive

329
00:15:35,572 --> 00:15:37,486
an all-out war
against the subcommittee.

330
00:15:37,606 --> 00:15:39,508
Let me worry
about that.

331
00:15:39,576 --> 00:15:41,710
No, you should worry
about Senator Mayer.

332
00:15:41,777 --> 00:15:43,612
He's not going
to let go of this.

333
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:45,013
He's got his teeth in it.

334
00:15:46,749 --> 00:15:48,150
Senator Mayer's dead.

335
00:15:49,952 --> 00:15:52,121
He was killed
by a rogue federal agent

336
00:15:52,188 --> 00:15:54,523
not one hour ago, tragically.

337
00:15:58,328 --> 00:15:59,828
Jonas.

338
00:16:05,034 --> 00:16:07,402
Tell me you had
nothing to do with this.

339
00:16:09,038 --> 00:16:11,640
Are you accusing me
of complicity

340
00:16:11,707 --> 00:16:14,009
in the murder
of Senator Mayer?

341
00:16:14,076 --> 00:16:16,512
I want a personal assurance.

342
00:16:18,714 --> 00:16:21,116
Starkwood is not
in the business

343
00:16:21,184 --> 00:16:22,884
of political
assassination, Doug.

344
00:16:24,287 --> 00:16:26,321
Though maybe we should
look into it.

345
00:16:26,389 --> 00:16:28,390
I hear it's a growth market.

346
00:16:39,068 --> 00:16:41,126
Jack, you finding anything?

347
00:16:41,246 --> 00:16:43,172
12 ships were unloaded
here today.

348
00:16:43,239 --> 00:16:44,406
Any from Sangala?

349
00:16:44,474 --> 00:16:47,176
There's no deepwater port in
that area of West Africa.

350
00:16:47,243 --> 00:16:48,843
If the weapon
originated from there,

351
00:16:48,911 --> 00:16:52,281
it would've had to overland
into Pointe-Noire.

352
00:16:52,348 --> 00:16:54,449
Where...

353
00:16:54,517 --> 00:16:56,385
two of the 12 ships acquired

354
00:16:56,452 --> 00:16:58,720
cargo from that port
within the last four weeks.

355
00:17:00,423 --> 00:17:01,723
Come on.

356
00:17:03,159 --> 00:17:05,360
Come on. Damn it!

357
00:17:05,428 --> 00:17:07,262
What is it?
I can't access

358
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:09,398
their manifests; their database
is password protected.

359
00:17:14,604 --> 00:17:15,704
What's your name, officer?

360
00:17:15,771 --> 00:17:16,905
Gadsen.

361
00:17:16,972 --> 00:17:18,139
Carl Gadsen.

362
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:19,308
I don't have any information

363
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:20,576
about a password.

364
00:17:20,643 --> 00:17:23,144
Carl, I want you to listen
to me very carefully.

365
00:17:23,213 --> 00:17:24,946
The same terrorists who took down
two planes earlier today

366
00:17:25,014 --> 00:17:26,315
and attacked
the White House are trying

367
00:17:26,382 --> 00:17:27,549
to acquire a weapon
of mass destruction.

368
00:17:27,617 --> 00:17:29,484
They're coming here
to pick up that weapon.

369
00:17:29,552 --> 00:17:30,919
It's somewhere
out there

370
00:17:30,986 --> 00:17:32,721
in your yard in one
of those canisters.

371
00:17:32,788 --> 00:17:34,623
Look, I understand
this might be hard

372
00:17:34,691 --> 00:17:36,891
for you to believe.
No, actually, it's not.

373
00:17:36,959 --> 00:17:38,493
You don't have a lot of time.

374
00:17:38,561 --> 00:17:39,994
What do you mean?

375
00:17:40,062 --> 00:17:41,796
They are coming.

376
00:17:41,864 --> 00:17:43,232
In fact, they should
be here already.

377
00:17:43,299 --> 00:17:44,933
Keep talking, Carl.

378
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,901
They told me they
were smuggling in

379
00:17:46,969 --> 00:17:48,237
electronics from South Korea.

380
00:17:48,304 --> 00:17:49,271
I swear.

381
00:17:49,339 --> 00:17:51,573
I had no idea they
were terrorists.

382
00:17:51,641 --> 00:17:52,774
What'd you agree to do for them?

383
00:17:52,842 --> 00:17:54,509
Open the front gate.
Look the other way.

384
00:17:54,577 --> 00:17:56,745
Is that it?

385
00:17:56,812 --> 00:17:58,012
Disable the security cameras.

386
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,415
A yard this size should
have more police officers.

387
00:18:00,483 --> 00:18:02,284
Where are they?
I'm the supervisor.

388
00:18:02,352 --> 00:18:03,785
I do the shift schedules.

389
00:18:03,853 --> 00:18:06,121
I made sure
I'd be the only one here.

390
00:18:06,188 --> 00:18:08,089
That's enough
confirmation for me.

391
00:18:08,157 --> 00:18:09,358
I'm making the call.
Untie him.

392
00:18:09,425 --> 00:18:10,492
Who's he calling?

393
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,193
The FBI.
Now that we're confident

394
00:18:12,262 --> 00:18:14,596
the weapon's here, we're calling
in the authorities.

395
00:18:19,034 --> 00:18:21,270
Tony? My cell is down,
so is the landline.

396
00:18:21,337 --> 00:18:23,305
Someone's jamming
communications.

397
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,379
Carl ...

398
00:18:30,446 --> 00:18:32,314
It's them.

399
00:18:32,382 --> 00:18:34,783
They gave me that radio;
told me they'd be

400
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:36,585
contacting me.
Answer the call. Just play along.

401
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,886
Carl ...

402
00:18:39,922 --> 00:18:41,590
Answer the call.

403
00:18:44,761 --> 00:18:45,727
Hello?

404
00:18:45,795 --> 00:18:46,728
Where are you?

405
00:18:46,796 --> 00:18:48,730
I didn't think you were coming.

406
00:18:48,798 --> 00:18:50,031
You're late.
Well, we're here now

407
00:18:50,099 --> 00:18:51,933
and we're waiting.

408
00:18:52,001 --> 00:18:54,436
Okay.

409
00:18:54,504 --> 00:18:55,804
They're at the front gate.

410
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:57,272
Put your belt back on.

411
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:58,707
I want you
to resume your post.

412
00:18:58,775 --> 00:19:00,342
Pretend like
everything's normal.

413
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:01,910
Just let them in.
And then what?

414
00:19:01,977 --> 00:19:03,745
We're going to follow them
as soon as they pick up

415
00:19:03,813 --> 00:19:05,314
their container;
once we're past

416
00:19:05,381 --> 00:19:06,915
the jamming grid, we'll make our call.
I don't know.

417
00:19:06,982 --> 00:19:08,883
What do you mean you don't know?

418
00:19:08,951 --> 00:19:10,786
You're a part
of this, Carl,

419
00:19:10,853 --> 00:19:12,321
whether you want
to be or not.

420
00:19:12,388 --> 00:19:14,423
You became a part of it this
the second you said

421
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:16,191
"yes" to these people.
Jack!

422
00:19:16,258 --> 00:19:18,159
What do you got?
I got three vehicles.

423
00:19:18,227 --> 00:19:19,928
Eight hostiles,

424
00:19:19,995 --> 00:19:22,230
heavily armed; got to assume
there's more inside the trucks.

425
00:19:22,298 --> 00:19:25,701
Carl, if you don't
open that gate, they're going

426
00:19:25,768 --> 00:19:27,869
to come in here looking
you, you understand me?

427
00:19:29,271 --> 00:19:31,139
Let me put it to you this way.

428
00:19:31,207 --> 00:19:34,175
These men have killed
over 300 people today.

429
00:19:34,243 --> 00:19:36,378
If they get ahold
of that weapon,

430
00:19:36,446 --> 00:19:38,714
they're going to make that
look like child's play.

431
00:19:40,149 --> 00:19:42,584
You've only got one choice here.

432
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,722
I just open the gate
and let them in.

433
00:19:46,789 --> 00:19:48,390
That's all you've got to do.

434
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:50,559
And you guys got my back, right?
Yeah.

435
00:19:50,626 --> 00:19:52,627
Promise me.

436
00:19:57,132 --> 00:19:58,567
I promise you.

437
00:20:02,505 --> 00:20:03,938
Okay.

438
00:20:04,006 --> 00:20:05,640
Tony, get
the surveillance package.

439
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:07,175
Don't worry.

440
00:20:07,243 --> 00:20:08,810
It's just so we can hear
what's going on.

441
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:12,113
Turn around.

442
00:20:12,181 --> 00:20:14,349
I need to put
this on your back.

443
00:20:14,417 --> 00:20:16,818
Listen, the money--
it wasn't about

444
00:20:16,886 --> 00:20:18,987
greed or anything.

445
00:20:19,054 --> 00:20:21,456
It's my wife, Linda.
She's having twins.

446
00:20:21,524 --> 00:20:23,692
They say it's the most natural
thing in the world, right?

447
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,860
Getting pregnant?

448
00:20:24,927 --> 00:20:26,895
Well, it took us three years,

449
00:20:26,962 --> 00:20:28,196
cost an arm and a leg.

450
00:20:28,264 --> 00:20:32,567
No excuses, but insurance
doesn't cover a dime.

451
00:20:32,635 --> 00:20:34,369
I just always wanted
to have a family.

452
00:20:34,437 --> 00:20:35,771
You know what I mean?

453
00:20:35,838 --> 00:20:37,839
Put this in your pocket.

454
00:20:38,674 --> 00:20:39,741
You got him?

455
00:20:39,809 --> 00:20:41,610
Yeah.

456
00:20:47,016 --> 00:20:48,517
Remember, it's just another

457
00:20:48,584 --> 00:20:49,918
day at the office.

458
00:20:49,985 --> 00:20:52,153
You're going
to be fine.

459
00:20:53,188 --> 00:20:54,523
Let's go.

460
00:21:14,721 --> 00:21:16,489
What took you
so long, Carl?

461
00:21:16,556 --> 00:21:18,024
You got the routing
documents?

462
00:21:18,092 --> 00:21:19,692
Sure.

463
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,594
I need to see them in order
to locate the container.

464
00:21:21,662 --> 00:21:23,863
Relax, Carl.
They're right here.

465
00:21:26,934 --> 00:21:29,002
Okay.

466
00:21:29,069 --> 00:21:31,204
Center section.

467
00:21:31,272 --> 00:21:34,540
Row 36, Q-block.

468
00:21:34,608 --> 00:21:36,542
It's that fourth stack
on your left.

469
00:21:37,945 --> 00:21:40,476
I know where
the container is, Carl.

470
00:21:40,596 --> 00:21:42,515
Did you disable
the security cameras?

471
00:21:42,582 --> 00:21:44,050
They've been off
since 10:00,

472
00:21:44,118 --> 00:21:45,451
just like you said.

473
00:21:48,422 --> 00:21:49,856
How's your wife?

474
00:21:49,924 --> 00:21:52,091
She's fine.

475
00:21:53,727 --> 00:21:55,561
You didn't tell her anything
about this, did you?

476
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:57,663
No, of course not.

477
00:21:57,731 --> 00:21:59,833
Did you tell anybody else?

478
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,434
No, no, why would I?

479
00:22:01,501 --> 00:22:03,469
You tell me, Carl.

480
00:22:04,504 --> 00:22:07,373
Why are you so nervous?

481
00:22:07,441 --> 00:22:11,010
Okay, um, you want
to know the truth, Mr. Stokes?

482
00:22:11,078 --> 00:22:14,280
Uh... I was expecting
a simple pickup,

483
00:22:14,348 --> 00:22:16,015
but you show up

484
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:18,384
with a small army here, and, um...
And what?

485
00:22:18,452 --> 00:22:22,421
It's just... not what-what I
was expecting, that's all.

486
00:22:22,489 --> 00:22:24,690
I just don't want
to get caught.

487
00:22:24,758 --> 00:22:28,794
Nobody's gonna
get caught, Carl.

488
00:22:28,863 --> 00:22:30,263
Let's go,
we're moving.

489
00:22:30,331 --> 00:22:32,465
You too, Carl,
take a ride.

490
00:22:32,532 --> 00:22:34,734
I told you, it's the
fourth stack on your left.

491
00:22:34,801 --> 00:22:35,835
Q-block, row 36.

492
00:22:35,903 --> 00:22:36,936
I'd feel better
if you showed us.

493
00:22:37,004 --> 00:22:38,738
I really should stay here,
Mr. Stokes.

494
00:22:38,805 --> 00:22:40,106
I got to finish
my patrol.

495
00:22:40,174 --> 00:22:41,174
Why, Carl?

496
00:22:41,242 --> 00:22:42,541
You expecting
somebody?

497
00:22:42,609 --> 00:22:44,744
No.
Then get in.

498
00:22:47,147 --> 00:22:49,148
Okay.

499
00:22:55,356 --> 00:22:56,555
Damn it.

500
00:22:56,623 --> 00:22:59,025
Forget about him, Jack.

501
00:22:59,093 --> 00:23:01,094
He was dead the minute
he stepped out that door.

502
00:23:01,161 --> 00:23:04,030
You and I
both know that.

503
00:23:22,983 --> 00:23:24,984
Ethan, I just came
to say how sorry I am.

504
00:23:25,052 --> 00:23:29,822
Well, I appreciate the courtesy
if not the sincerity.

505
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:34,593
As much as I may feel this
is what's best for my mother,

506
00:23:34,661 --> 00:23:36,296
on a personal level

507
00:23:36,363 --> 00:23:38,697
I'm sorry you have
to go through this...

508
00:23:38,765 --> 00:23:40,431
and for some
of the harsher things

509
00:23:40,551 --> 00:23:44,137
I said to you
in anger.

510
00:23:44,204 --> 00:23:46,705
Well, I suppose I owe
you an apology, too,

511
00:23:46,773 --> 00:23:49,028
for accusing you

512
00:23:49,148 --> 00:23:51,945
of leaking my role
in this Bauer fiasco

513
00:23:52,012 --> 00:23:53,579
to the press.

514
00:23:53,647 --> 00:23:56,282
I really believed you were
trying to blindside me.

515
00:23:57,751 --> 00:24:00,232
Considering the impression I
gave you, I'm not surprised.

516
00:24:00,921 --> 00:24:03,522
Olivia,

517
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:06,659
as someone who's known you
most of your life,

518
00:24:06,726 --> 00:24:08,661
I'd like to offer
some advice.

519
00:24:08,728 --> 00:24:10,696
Of course.

520
00:24:15,436 --> 00:24:17,437
Ambition can be
a valuable quality

521
00:24:17,504 --> 00:24:19,339
here in Washington

522
00:24:19,406 --> 00:24:22,275
as well as in life,

523
00:24:22,343 --> 00:24:26,879
but unchecked, it can be
unhealthy, if not dangerous.

524
00:24:26,947 --> 00:24:29,382
What I'm trying
to say is...

525
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:33,219
you got yourself a seat
at the president's table.

526
00:24:33,287 --> 00:24:36,289
She listens
to you.

527
00:24:36,357 --> 00:24:39,558
But running a country
is not like running

528
00:24:39,626 --> 00:24:41,527
a campaign.

529
00:24:41,595 --> 00:24:45,231
It's not about doing
whatever it takes to win.

530
00:24:45,299 --> 00:24:48,734
It's about doing what's right
for the American people.

531
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:54,607
Sometimes those things
aren't mutually exclusive.

532
00:25:01,315 --> 00:25:03,316
Well...

533
00:25:04,918 --> 00:25:06,852
good-bye, Olivia.

534
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,921
Good-bye.

535
00:25:21,168 --> 00:25:23,102
Hello.

536
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:24,504
It's Olivia.

537
00:25:24,571 --> 00:25:27,006
You can go with that story now,
Ken, and it just got better.

538
00:25:27,074 --> 00:25:28,941
Tell me.

539
00:25:29,009 --> 00:25:30,876
Ethan Kanin's resigning.

540
00:25:30,944 --> 00:25:31,877
What happened?

541
00:25:31,945 --> 00:25:33,246
I thought the plan was
to let him twist

542
00:25:33,313 --> 00:25:34,414
in the wind
for a while.

543
00:25:34,481 --> 00:25:35,748
His hand was forced.
Thank you.

544
00:25:35,815 --> 00:25:37,250
It seems Jack Bauer
just murdered

545
00:25:37,317 --> 00:25:39,752
Senator Mayer.

546
00:25:39,819 --> 00:25:41,154
What?

547
00:25:41,221 --> 00:25:43,322
You're kidding me.

548
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:44,790
Anybody else have this yet?

549
00:25:44,858 --> 00:25:47,427
Not yet, it's all yours
in time for the 11:00.

550
00:25:47,494 --> 00:25:49,295
Told you I'd take
care of you, didn't I?

551
00:25:49,363 --> 00:25:50,663
You are too good
to me, Olivia.

552
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:53,332
You just hold
up your end.

553
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,334
Make sure Kanin's
the fall guy.

554
00:25:55,402 --> 00:25:57,203
My mother is nowhere near this,
understand?

555
00:25:57,271 --> 00:25:58,671
No problem.

556
00:25:58,738 --> 00:26:01,071
She really doesn't have any idea
that you're the leak?

557
00:26:01,191 --> 00:26:03,433
No, and it'd better stay
that way.

558
00:26:03,553 --> 00:26:06,546
She won't hear it from me.

559
00:26:06,613 --> 00:26:07,780
When are we having that dinner

560
00:26:07,847 --> 00:26:09,014
you promised?

561
00:26:09,083 --> 00:26:11,884
Maybe next week.

562
00:26:11,952 --> 00:26:13,152
It's always
next week.

563
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:14,220
You'd better get to work

564
00:26:14,288 --> 00:26:16,055
if you're going to make
that broadcast.

565
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:34,448
Preliminary ballistics.

566
00:26:34,517 --> 00:26:36,484
So these files on the computer--

567
00:26:36,552 --> 00:26:37,852
presumably
Senator Mayer was looking

568
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,086
at 'em before
he was killed?

569
00:26:39,154 --> 00:26:40,087
Someone was, sir.

570
00:26:40,155 --> 00:26:41,088
They were opened
and viewed

571
00:26:41,156 --> 00:26:42,624
within the last hour.

572
00:26:42,691 --> 00:26:44,926
So if the sen...

573
00:26:44,994 --> 00:26:48,704
if the senator was killed
point-blank

574
00:26:48,824 --> 00:26:50,598
in the entry hall,
how are we explaining the slugs

575
00:26:50,666 --> 00:26:52,634
in the door frame
and the railing?

576
00:26:52,701 --> 00:26:53,801
I don't know, sir.

577
00:26:53,869 --> 00:26:55,703
Get the crime lab guys on it.

578
00:26:55,771 --> 00:26:57,772
Yes, sir.

579
00:27:11,186 --> 00:27:13,501
Agent Walker,
it's Larry Moss for you.

580
00:27:15,123 --> 00:27:17,058
Hello.

581
00:27:17,125 --> 00:27:18,392
Senator Mayer is dead.

582
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:21,095
Where's Jack?

583
00:27:21,163 --> 00:27:25,466
Don't know;
we don't have him.

584
00:27:25,534 --> 00:27:27,869
Okay, but what, you think
that he did this, Larry?

585
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:28,937
First Burnett
and now Mayer?

586
00:27:29,004 --> 00:27:30,404
Well...

587
00:27:30,472 --> 00:27:32,139
it looks that way.

588
00:27:32,207 --> 00:27:34,175
What do you mean
"looks that way"?

589
00:27:34,242 --> 00:27:36,143
Well, that's why I'm calling.
Senator Mayer

590
00:27:36,211 --> 00:27:38,245
was killed with a UMP
40 submachine gun.

591
00:27:38,313 --> 00:27:39,948
If Bauer was on the run,

592
00:27:40,015 --> 00:27:42,183
where'd he get ahold
of a weapon like that?

593
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:44,518
Also, there's evidence
to suggest that the, uh--

594
00:27:44,587 --> 00:27:45,954
there was a third party
in the house

595
00:27:46,021 --> 00:27:47,922
when the senator was killed.
What kind of evidence?

596
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:49,972
Unexplained slugs...

597
00:27:50,459 --> 00:27:52,493
...a broken set
of French doors,

598
00:27:52,561 --> 00:27:53,928
a chair where it doesn't belong.

599
00:27:53,996 --> 00:27:55,630
Okay, so are you saying that
this third party killed Mayer?

600
00:27:55,698 --> 00:27:56,798
Well, you know, Renee,

601
00:27:56,865 --> 00:27:58,700
I might be saying that
if I knew what the hell

602
00:27:58,767 --> 00:28:01,803
Bauer was doing here
in the first place.

603
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:03,137
All right, Renee, listen.

604
00:28:03,205 --> 00:28:04,505
I want to meet you
halfway, I do,

605
00:28:04,573 --> 00:28:06,273
but if you expect me
to even entertain

606
00:28:06,341 --> 00:28:08,209
Bauer's innocence,
you have got to help me here.

607
00:28:08,276 --> 00:28:09,210
I can't, Larry.

608
00:28:09,277 --> 00:28:10,645
If Jack is still underground,

609
00:28:10,713 --> 00:28:12,379
he is underground for a reason.

610
00:28:12,447 --> 00:28:14,949
There were files open
on Mayer's computer--

611
00:28:15,017 --> 00:28:17,885
documents relating to his
investigation into Starkwood.

612
00:28:17,953 --> 00:28:19,954
All right, so just tell
me that, tell me that.

613
00:28:20,022 --> 00:28:23,224
Did Starkwood ever come up in
your conversation with Bauer?

614
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:30,999
Renee.

615
00:28:31,066 --> 00:28:35,503
Look, maybe, maybe I should
have trusted you before, okay,

616
00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:39,140
but you have got
to trust me now.

617
00:28:39,207 --> 00:28:42,276
What role does Starkwood play
in all this?

618
00:28:48,583 --> 00:28:50,518
The man who framed Jack

619
00:28:50,585 --> 00:28:54,922
for Burnett's murder was John
Quinn, a Starkwood contractor.

620
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:56,691
Jack believes that
they were behind Juma

621
00:28:56,759 --> 00:28:58,993
and all of the
terrorist attacks today.

622
00:28:59,061 --> 00:29:01,362
He went to Mayer to get
the evidence to prove it.

623
00:29:01,429 --> 00:29:04,766
I have to assume that
Quinn followed him there.

624
00:29:04,833 --> 00:29:06,433
That's all that I
know, Larry, I swear.

625
00:29:06,501 --> 00:29:09,003
Okay, I believe you.

626
00:29:09,071 --> 00:29:10,104
Thank you.

627
00:29:10,172 --> 00:29:12,940
Just sit tight,
I'll be in touch soon.

628
00:29:13,008 --> 00:29:14,042
Well, let me help, Larry.

629
00:29:14,109 --> 00:29:15,276
I mean, Jack could still be
out there.

630
00:29:15,343 --> 00:29:16,377
He may be in trouble.

631
00:29:16,444 --> 00:29:18,012
No, no, I can't release you,
not yet.

632
00:29:33,261 --> 00:29:34,962
Reese, what's the status?

633
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:36,597
Just getting the chassis on,
sir, I'll be a minute.

634
00:29:36,665 --> 00:29:37,665
Hurry it up.

635
00:29:40,468 --> 00:29:43,104
Hold up, hold up,
I don't have my truck.

636
00:29:43,172 --> 00:29:44,772
Put it down there,
I want it there.

637
00:29:59,454 --> 00:30:00,955
Mitch, get up there.

638
00:30:01,023 --> 00:30:02,090
Let's run a diagnostic now.

639
00:30:02,157 --> 00:30:03,324
I want to be
ready to roll

640
00:30:03,391 --> 00:30:05,059
as soon as Reese gets
here with that flatbed.

641
00:30:05,127 --> 00:30:07,695
Yes, sir.

642
00:30:17,973 --> 00:30:19,673
All right, there's the package.

643
00:30:19,742 --> 00:30:21,109
We should get back to the car.

644
00:30:21,176 --> 00:30:22,643
We want to be in position
to follow that container

645
00:30:22,711 --> 00:30:23,845
once they move out.

646
00:30:26,681 --> 00:30:28,983
Jack.

647
00:30:29,051 --> 00:30:31,786
Just give me one second.

648
00:30:31,854 --> 00:30:33,087
Cooper.

649
00:30:33,155 --> 00:30:34,756
Now's as good a time
as any

650
00:30:34,823 --> 00:30:35,757
to settle up with Carl.

651
00:30:35,824 --> 00:30:37,591
Yes, sir.

652
00:30:37,659 --> 00:30:38,692
Thanks, Carl.

653
00:30:38,761 --> 00:30:41,195
Good luck.

654
00:30:41,263 --> 00:30:43,330
Let's go.

655
00:30:43,398 --> 00:30:44,899
Where we going?

656
00:30:44,967 --> 00:30:47,368
Your money's in my truck,
just one aisle over.

657
00:30:47,369 --> 00:30:48,569
Come On.

658
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,707
Jack, we should
get going.

659
00:30:53,776 --> 00:30:54,842
No.

660
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:04,318
What are you doing?

661
00:31:04,386 --> 00:31:05,319
I thought you said

662
00:31:05,387 --> 00:31:07,221
the money was
in the truck.

663
00:31:09,557 --> 00:31:11,826
What the hell's going on?

664
00:31:11,894 --> 00:31:14,061
Just keep moving.

665
00:31:14,129 --> 00:31:17,265
Listen, I don't know
what Stokes told you,

666
00:31:17,332 --> 00:31:18,699
but I didn't tell a soul.

667
00:31:21,904 --> 00:31:24,605
Damn it, Jack,
what the hell are you doing?

668
00:31:24,673 --> 00:31:25,973
Don't do it.

669
00:31:26,041 --> 00:31:27,775
You're gonna turn a surveillance
job into a firefight.

670
00:31:27,843 --> 00:31:29,210
It'll be two against ten.

671
00:31:29,278 --> 00:31:30,611
Two against nine.

672
00:31:30,679 --> 00:31:32,479
Right, and we lose
our best chance

673
00:31:32,547 --> 00:31:34,115
at getting
this weapon.

674
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:35,149
Don't break
your own rules.

675
00:31:35,217 --> 00:31:36,184
You may save
one man,

676
00:31:36,251 --> 00:31:37,751
but what about the thousands
of people

677
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:39,187
who could die
in a biological attack?

678
00:31:39,254 --> 00:31:42,290
Is this about you,
Jack, or about them?

679
00:31:42,357 --> 00:31:43,858
You want to prevent
another disaster

680
00:31:43,926 --> 00:31:45,960
or ensure that it's going
to happen?

681
00:31:51,566 --> 00:31:53,234
That's far enough.

682
00:31:55,103 --> 00:31:56,137
Turn around.

683
00:31:58,173 --> 00:32:01,075
You're going to kill me,

684
00:32:01,143 --> 00:32:03,244
you're going to have
to look me in the eye.

685
00:32:03,312 --> 00:32:05,379
Okay.

686
00:32:07,415 --> 00:32:09,416
Damn it.

687
00:32:11,453 --> 00:32:14,222
Thank you, thank you.

688
00:32:14,289 --> 00:32:15,789
We've got about 30 seconds

689
00:32:15,858 --> 00:32:17,291
before they figure out
what happened.

690
00:32:17,359 --> 00:32:18,625
Okay, what's our fallback?

691
00:32:18,693 --> 00:32:20,627
Steal the truck.
Strong?

692
00:32:20,695 --> 00:32:22,796
I'll make the direct assault,
you cover the east flank.

693
00:32:22,865 --> 00:32:24,431
All we need is
a big enough firefight

694
00:32:24,499 --> 00:32:25,766
to get one of us
behind the wheel.

695
00:32:25,834 --> 00:32:26,968
You ready?
Yeah.

696
00:32:27,035 --> 00:32:29,136
Go.

697
00:32:32,341 --> 00:32:34,242
How do we look?

698
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:37,945
Diagnostics check out, sir.

699
00:32:38,013 --> 00:32:39,947
The package is stable.

700
00:32:40,015 --> 00:32:42,216
Good.

701
00:32:42,284 --> 00:32:45,286
All right,
let's get her on the chassis!

702
00:33:03,471 --> 00:33:04,438
Cooper, come on.

703
00:33:04,506 --> 00:33:06,640
Let's roll.

704
00:33:06,708 --> 00:33:08,542
Cooper, do you copy?

705
00:33:16,851 --> 00:33:18,119
Dolen.

706
00:33:18,186 --> 00:33:19,220
Check the next
aisle over.

707
00:33:19,288 --> 00:33:21,122
Find Cooper.

708
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:26,727
Hold your position.

709
00:33:26,795 --> 00:33:27,962
Wait for my signal.

710
00:33:33,668 --> 00:33:34,868
Cooper's down, Cooper's down.

711
00:33:34,937 --> 00:33:36,037
Code red, code red!

712
00:33:36,104 --> 00:33:37,638
Let's move out... Greer.

713
00:33:37,705 --> 00:33:39,606
Engage... engage.

714
00:34:34,396 --> 00:34:36,163
Reese, get the truck
out of here now!

715
00:34:36,231 --> 00:34:38,332
Go, go, go!

716
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,433
Tony!

717
00:34:39,501 --> 00:34:40,801
The truck-- I'm going after it.

718
00:34:40,869 --> 00:34:41,927
Cover me now!

719
00:35:12,067 --> 00:35:16,070
Two shooters--
fan out and find them.

720
00:35:47,469 --> 00:35:49,503
Tony, this is Jack--
do you copy?

721
00:36:04,419 --> 00:36:05,619
Drop it.

722
00:36:10,658 --> 00:36:11,792
Tony?

723
00:36:11,859 --> 00:36:13,360
I know you.

724
00:36:14,435 --> 00:36:17,030
You're on Emerson's crew.

725
00:36:17,099 --> 00:36:19,133
You're Almeida, right?

726
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:25,506
I know Bauer's with you.

727
00:36:25,574 --> 00:36:26,673
Now, where is he?

728
00:36:53,141 --> 00:36:55,009
Larry Moss.

729
00:36:55,077 --> 00:36:57,445
- Larry, it's Jack.
- Jack, where the hell have you been?

730
00:36:57,512 --> 00:36:59,180
I need you
to scramble multiple teams

731
00:36:59,247 --> 00:37:01,615
to a weigh station on
Highway 236, exit 29.

732
00:37:01,683 --> 00:37:03,851
I'm in a big rig about
ten miles south.

733
00:37:03,918 --> 00:37:05,019
What's going on?

734
00:37:05,087 --> 00:37:06,854
You also need to send
a CDC recovery unit.

735
00:37:06,921 --> 00:37:07,989
Why?

736
00:37:08,056 --> 00:37:09,490
I'm in possession of
a biological weapon

737
00:37:09,557 --> 00:37:11,058
interdicted at the
Port of Alexandria.

738
00:37:12,094 --> 00:37:13,194
A biological weapon?

739
00:37:13,261 --> 00:37:14,195
Larry, just listen to me.

740
00:37:14,262 --> 00:37:15,329
I don't care if you arrest me.

741
00:37:15,397 --> 00:37:16,464
I don't care if you shoot me.

742
00:37:16,531 --> 00:37:18,399
Just get your teams
out here.

743
00:37:18,467 --> 00:37:20,767
I fully expect
to be pursued by hostiles.

744
00:37:20,835 --> 00:37:22,036
Starkwood?

745
00:37:22,104 --> 00:37:23,437
How do you know
about Starkwood?

746
00:37:23,505 --> 00:37:24,638
I talked to Renee.

747
00:37:24,706 --> 00:37:26,140
And I saw what was
on Mayer's computer.

748
00:37:26,208 --> 00:37:27,674
Larry, they're coming
after this weapon.

749
00:37:27,742 --> 00:37:28,942
You can count on it.

750
00:37:29,011 --> 00:37:30,244
Now, be advised, I believe

751
00:37:30,312 --> 00:37:32,179
that Tony Almeida
is being held hostage.

752
00:37:32,247 --> 00:37:34,815
All right, I'll call out
an interagency alert.

753
00:37:34,883 --> 00:37:35,816
We'll secure both locations.

754
00:37:35,884 --> 00:37:36,817
Larry, hurry.

755
00:40:41,636 --> 00:40:43,571
Damn it!

756
00:40:55,398 --> 00:40:56,483
Sir, this is Stokes.

757
00:40:56,551 --> 00:40:58,018
What's your status?

758
00:40:58,086 --> 00:40:59,986
The package is secure--
we're inbound.

759
00:41:00,054 --> 00:41:01,555
What about Bauer?

760
00:41:01,623 --> 00:41:03,023
He's at the scene, sir,

761
00:41:03,091 --> 00:41:04,558
but he sought cover nearby.

762
00:41:04,626 --> 00:41:06,159
Well, we have to assume

763
00:41:06,228 --> 00:41:08,128
that he contacted
the authorities,

764
00:41:08,196 --> 00:41:11,232
so we better be on
an accelerated timetable.

765
00:41:11,299 --> 00:41:12,466
Get over here.

766
00:41:12,534 --> 00:41:14,000
It will be there
in ten minutes.

767
00:41:14,068 --> 00:41:15,068
We're right behind.

768
00:41:15,136 --> 00:41:16,169
Good.

769
00:41:17,805 --> 00:41:21,041
I've got teams on the ground
prepping for your arrival.

770
00:41:26,114 --> 00:41:27,147
Larry Moss.

771
00:41:27,215 --> 00:41:28,315
Larry, it's Jack.

772
00:41:28,383 --> 00:41:30,016
I'm still on Route 236,

773
00:41:30,084 --> 00:41:31,918
but I had to stop
approximately seven miles

774
00:41:31,986 --> 00:41:33,387
before the weigh station.

775
00:41:33,455 --> 00:41:35,322
Jack, I got two units
moving to you right now.

776
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:37,124
Yeah, well, you're gonna
have to redirect them.

777
00:41:37,191 --> 00:41:38,125
Why?

778
00:41:38,192 --> 00:41:39,860
Starkwood reacquired
the bioweapon.

779
00:41:39,927 --> 00:41:41,061
They managed
to access

780
00:41:41,129 --> 00:41:42,663
one of the dock's
freight helicopters.

781
00:41:42,731 --> 00:41:45,332
While they had me pinned down,
they airlifted the freight

782
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,667
right out of here.

783
00:41:46,735 --> 00:41:48,569
They were headed due west
from my current position.

784
00:41:48,637 --> 00:41:50,771
West... they got
a large military facility

785
00:41:50,838 --> 00:41:51,872
in that area.

786
00:41:51,939 --> 00:41:53,240
Okay, good--
redirect the teams there.

787
00:41:53,308 --> 00:41:54,975
Jack, I can't assault
a private compound

788
00:41:55,042 --> 00:41:56,343
unless I have proof

789
00:41:56,411 --> 00:41:57,344
that a weapon exists.

790
00:41:57,412 --> 00:41:58,545
Okay, where's the CDC?

791
00:41:58,613 --> 00:42:00,113
They're scrambling a team
right now.

792
00:42:00,181 --> 00:42:01,536
Send them to me.

793
00:42:01,656 --> 00:42:03,317
You'll have
all the proof you need.

794
00:42:03,385 --> 00:42:04,551
Jack, what happened?

795
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:07,154
One of the canisters
was breached

796
00:42:07,221 --> 00:42:08,221
during the interdiction.

797
00:42:08,290 --> 00:42:11,191
Some of the bio-agent
was released.

798
00:42:11,259 --> 00:42:13,059
I...

799
00:42:13,127 --> 00:42:14,628
I was exposed.

800
00:42:16,765 --> 00:42:17,864
Okay.

801
00:42:17,932 --> 00:42:19,366
Jack, just sit tight.

802
00:42:19,434 --> 00:42:20,867
CDC's on the way.

803
00:42:20,935 --> 00:42:22,503
They're going to be there soon.
