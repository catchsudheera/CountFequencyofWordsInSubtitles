1
00:00:14,207 --> 00:00:17,518
Terrorists are controlling
the main terminal of Ontario Airport.

2
00:00:17,608 --> 00:00:20,679
Today your president and
the president of Russia have come together

3
00:00:20,767 --> 00:00:23,645
to sign an anti-terrorism alliance.

4
00:00:23,727 --> 00:00:25,444
I have hostages.

5
00:00:25,527 --> 00:00:28,360
<i>Unless President Logan
and President Suvarov</i>

6
00:00:28,447 --> 00:00:33,043
<i>make a joint statement repudiating
this accord, I will order their execution. </i>

7
00:00:33,127 --> 00:00:35,722
I want this handled!
Do you understand?

8
00:00:35,808 --> 00:00:39,357
I don't care how you do it.
I don't care what it takes. Fix it!

9
00:00:39,447 --> 00:00:41,963
David Palmer called me last night.

10
00:00:42,049 --> 00:00:46,086
He said it was a matter of national security.

11
00:00:46,168 --> 00:00:49,683
<i>I need to talk to you.
It's hardly a matter of national security. </i>

12
00:00:49,768 --> 00:00:51,122
- That's not what he said.
- Yes, it is.

13
00:00:51,209 --> 00:00:52,608
No, that is a trick.

14
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:55,881
I know all phone conversations are recorded.

15
00:00:55,969 --> 00:01:00,009
- Where do they store those transcripts?
- Archive room down the hall.

16
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:03,798
This is Bill Buchanan.
I'm hoping we can resolve this peacefully.

17
00:01:03,889 --> 00:01:06,562
I don't think you understand
how serious we are.

18
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:11,767
If you try to enter the terminal, you will spend
the rest of the day collecting body parts.

19
00:01:11,849 --> 00:01:13,840
Jack, I need you to quarterback this.

20
00:01:13,929 --> 00:01:16,524
I'm staring down on the main concourse.

21
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:21,000
I've got six hostiles in explosive vests
with orders to detonate if we make a move.

22
00:01:21,089 --> 00:01:24,128
I got a woman, Diane Huxley,
says she has info for CTU.

23
00:01:24,211 --> 00:01:27,327
- Diane, what's going on?
- Derek is inside the terminal.

24
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:29,082
You.

25
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:30,286
No!

26
00:01:30,371 --> 00:01:33,407
Curtis, they're moving another hostage.

27
00:01:33,491 --> 00:01:35,242
Oh, my God. It's Derek.

28
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:39,961
You have a problem at the terminal.
Jack Bauer's inside, providing recon for CTU.

29
00:01:40,051 --> 00:01:42,202
Hold on one second.

30
00:01:42,731 --> 00:01:44,131
Mr. Bauer.

31
00:01:44,211 --> 00:01:47,043
Derek has five seconds left to live.

32
00:01:47,131 --> 00:01:49,122
Four...

33
00:01:49,212 --> 00:01:51,202
Beresch!

34
00:02:08,973 --> 00:02:11,724
We've been trying,
but we can't make contact with Jack.

35
00:02:11,812 --> 00:02:13,724
- Can you make a visual?
- Negative.

36
00:02:13,813 --> 00:02:16,725
- Maybe Jack went dark intentionally.
- Unlikely.

37
00:02:16,813 --> 00:02:20,726
- He was talking when he was cut off.
- We assume he's been captured or killed.

38
00:02:20,814 --> 00:02:23,122
We mount the assault without his help.

39
00:02:23,213 --> 00:02:27,047
Without Jack directing our team,
success probability falls to less than 20%.

40
00:02:27,654 --> 00:02:30,247
President Logan
will sign this treaty in an hour.

41
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:33,212
If the terrorists remain,
they'll kill all the hostages.

42
00:02:33,294 --> 00:02:35,601
What do you want me to do, Bill?

43
00:02:36,053 --> 00:02:38,693
Work up an assault plan
that doesn't include Jack.

44
00:02:38,775 --> 00:02:41,651
I'll go back to the staging area
and coordinate from there.

45
00:02:41,733 --> 00:02:44,886
Get back to your stations.
Prepare to reconfigure.

46
00:02:44,974 --> 00:02:48,330
All teams, stand down.
We're working up a new mission profile.

47
00:02:48,413 --> 00:02:50,723
<i>Copy that. All teams, stand down. </i>

48
00:02:51,054 --> 00:02:53,522
Keep down. Keep your head down.

49
00:03:06,254 --> 00:03:09,646
Mr. Bauer, what is CTU's assault plan?

50
00:03:11,935 --> 00:03:17,294
The boy means something to you, or you
wouldn't have given yourself up so easily.

51
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:19,765
Tell me the plan.

52
00:03:24,015 --> 00:03:27,452
They're gonna storm the north
concourse doors on my command.

53
00:03:27,536 --> 00:03:29,731
I'm coordinating the operation from here.

54
00:03:29,816 --> 00:03:32,206
Is there anyone else inside?

55
00:03:33,137 --> 00:03:34,126
No.

56
00:03:35,575 --> 00:03:38,250
Get me the plans to the terminal.

57
00:03:39,537 --> 00:03:43,928
You've been a great help.
We'll keep the boy alive for now.

58
00:03:44,018 --> 00:03:46,212
Bring me another hostage.

59
00:03:50,857 --> 00:03:54,975
Anything you do in here today
will not stop that treaty from being signed.

60
00:03:55,056 --> 00:03:58,447
The US government does not negotiate
with terrorists. You know that.

61
00:03:58,538 --> 00:04:03,736
Your president is a weak man.
He'll back down once more blood is spilled.

62
00:04:03,818 --> 00:04:06,332
- On your feet!
- Not him.

63
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:15,728
- You, get up!
No! Don't!

64
00:04:16,059 --> 00:04:18,619
Please. Please, you don't have to do this.

65
00:04:19,699 --> 00:04:23,407
- Vlad.
- I can help you buy more time.

66
00:04:23,498 --> 00:04:24,647
Please!

67
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,978
No! You don't have to do this now.

68
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,974
On your knees!

69
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:41,132
CTU was supposed to have raided the
terminal by now. Why haven't we heard?

70
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:44,131
- Buchanan said they had a setback.
- What kind of setback?

71
00:04:44,221 --> 00:04:47,689
- They lost contact with Jack Bauer.
- Why? What happened to him?

72
00:04:47,779 --> 00:04:51,250
They're not sure, but they need
to reconfigure their assault plan.

73
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:54,696
<i>- Beresch is back online.
- I'll tell the president.</i>

74
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,811
Beresch is transmitting from the terminal.

75
00:04:58,901 --> 00:05:00,776
He's got another hostage.

76
00:05:02,102 --> 00:05:06,572
<i>We've waited patiently for you to renounce
this unholy pact with our oppressors. </i>

77
00:05:06,661 --> 00:05:09,050
<i>We have heard nothing. </i>

78
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,609
This is the cost of that silence.

79
00:05:19,181 --> 00:05:22,618
What happens next
is your choice, Mr. President.

80
00:05:22,702 --> 00:05:25,534
If you choose to sign this corrupt document,

81
00:05:25,621 --> 00:05:31,697
understand that you will also be staining it
with the blood of the remaining hostages.

82
00:05:36,182 --> 00:05:39,539
If CTU can't pull this off in time...

83
00:05:39,623 --> 00:05:42,422
That's upwards of 60 people, Mike.

84
00:05:42,503 --> 00:05:46,292
You know I've never done anything
I didn't feel was right for the country.

85
00:05:46,384 --> 00:05:50,171
Of course not, sir.
Nobody thinks otherwise.

86
00:05:54,023 --> 00:05:59,973
I know I'm ambitious and that I want this
treaty to be the hallmark of my presidency,

87
00:06:00,063 --> 00:06:03,261
but I never thought
I would sacrifice innocent life.

88
00:06:03,343 --> 00:06:07,781
Mr. President, you are not responsible
for the actions of these murderers.

89
00:06:07,863 --> 00:06:09,741
- I could postpone this.
- Sir?

90
00:06:09,824 --> 00:06:12,178
I give them what they want, nobody else dies.

91
00:06:12,263 --> 00:06:15,143
Do you think these people
would release the hostages?

92
00:06:15,226 --> 00:06:21,300
We both know that'll never happen.
You're doing the only thing you can do.

93
00:06:27,305 --> 00:06:30,581
<i> The terrorists are calling the treaty
an "unholy pact"... </i>

94
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:34,625
If someone altered the recording
of your conversation with David Palmer,

95
00:06:34,707 --> 00:06:37,696
- the president needs to know.
- No, not now. Not yet.

96
00:06:38,345 --> 00:06:40,986
- What are you waiting for?
- Charles is preoccupied.

97
00:06:41,066 --> 00:06:45,821
With the summit and the hostage situation,
he's not in the frame of mind to deal with this.

98
00:06:45,907 --> 00:06:49,102
Besides, he thinks I'm unstable,

99
00:06:49,185 --> 00:06:51,905
which means I have to show it to him
in the right way.

100
00:06:51,987 --> 00:06:57,585
So, until the treaty's signed,
I'm not letting this out of my sight.

101
00:07:05,147 --> 00:07:07,456
- What's happening?
- Sorry, no time to explain.

102
00:07:07,547 --> 00:07:11,666
- You were going in to get the hostages.
- We lost contact with Jack.

103
00:07:11,748 --> 00:07:15,456
- What does that mean?
- We're not sure, but we need to change plans.

104
00:07:15,547 --> 00:07:17,219
- Is Jack OK?
- We don't know.

105
00:07:17,307 --> 00:07:20,186
- What about Derek?
- As soon as we know, you'll be told.

106
00:07:20,267 --> 00:07:23,739
- Please, I...
- Miss Huxley, I need to go.

107
00:07:30,229 --> 00:07:32,662
<i> The situation
continues to grow more tragic. </i>

108
00:07:32,747 --> 00:07:35,217
<i>We've just received a video feed confirming</i>

109
00:07:35,309 --> 00:07:39,621
<i>that another hostage has been executed
inside the main terminal at Ontario Airport. </i>

110
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,700
- Jack...
- Don't say anything.

111
00:07:41,789 --> 00:07:45,419
We're gonna get through this.
Just don't say anything right now.

112
00:07:45,509 --> 00:07:49,388
<i> A White House spokesperson has
reiterated that President Logan will sign</i>

113
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:52,859
<i>a historic pact with
his Russian counterpart as scheduled. </i>

114
00:07:52,949 --> 00:08:00,426
<i>It has, of course, been a long-standing
foreign policy not to yield to terrorists... </i>

115
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:08,542
You're going to call CTU and tell them
you've revised your assault profile.

116
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:13,339
Tell them to come to the emergency door
south of gate 12.

117
00:08:14,349 --> 00:08:17,660
They won't do that because I ask.
They'll need an explanation.

118
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,945
That's your concern, Mr. Bauer.

119
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:30,302
Overwrite volume four
and re-key with the airport grid.

120
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:32,382
- Just one second.
- We don't have a second.

121
00:08:32,471 --> 00:08:34,190
We're running out of time.

122
00:08:34,272 --> 00:08:36,581
- Want some help, Spenser?
- He doesn't need it.

123
00:08:36,671 --> 00:08:39,629
Keep managing the two-ways,
or else we'll have dropouts.

124
00:08:39,711 --> 00:08:43,751
- Excuse me. You're Miss O'Brian, right?
- Who are you?

125
00:08:43,831 --> 00:08:48,587
Lynn McGill, from District. I met you
at that memory-management lecture.

126
00:08:48,673 --> 00:08:52,552
- If you say so. What do you need?
- I need to talk to Bill Buchanan.

127
00:08:52,632 --> 00:08:55,784
He's in the situation room.
He's kinda busy right now.

128
00:08:55,873 --> 00:08:58,068
I see him. Thanks.

129
00:08:58,153 --> 00:09:02,145
Looking forward to working with you today.

130
00:09:02,232 --> 00:09:07,785
- You don't know who McGill is, do you?
- No, and I don't care. Get back to work.

131
00:09:17,434 --> 00:09:22,064
Once Curtis's teams go in there,
I want an update on the deployment of HIT.

132
00:09:22,154 --> 00:09:23,951
Hi.

133
00:09:25,993 --> 00:09:29,304
- Mr. Buchanan, did they say I was coming?
- Lynn, please, call me Bill.

134
00:09:29,395 --> 00:09:32,990
If we were having a beer, but at work
a more formal mode of address is better.

135
00:09:33,074 --> 00:09:36,624
Whatever makes you feel comfortable.
We're in the middle of final prep.

136
00:09:36,715 --> 00:09:39,911
I understand President Logan
wants us to go in as soon as possible.

137
00:09:39,994 --> 00:09:43,782
- Yes, before the treaty's signed.
- Is Manning ready to send his teams in?

138
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,671
He is, but we're flying blind.

139
00:09:45,755 --> 00:09:48,873
My briefing sheet says
we have Jack Bauer on the inside.

140
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:51,230
We haven't heard from him for 20 minutes.

141
00:09:51,314 --> 00:09:53,511
That's interesting.

142
00:09:53,596 --> 00:09:58,271
I read the bulletin from Division,
but I don't know why you're here.

143
00:09:58,355 --> 00:10:00,996
- We were getting heat from the White House.
- About what?

144
00:10:01,076 --> 00:10:04,068
Jack Bauer. They wanna know
things are running smoothly.

145
00:10:04,156 --> 00:10:08,274
- We're on track, Lynn.
- I'm sure you are. That's my assignment.

146
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:12,953
- Is your tactical wired through to all servers?
- Yes. You can plug into station four.

147
00:10:13,037 --> 00:10:15,595
I'd prefer to work from your office,
Mr. Buchanan.

148
00:10:15,676 --> 00:10:18,396
I think I should have a central vantage point.

149
00:10:18,476 --> 00:10:23,267
I wanna make sure you're OK
working from another station.

150
00:10:23,357 --> 00:10:25,030
Fine.

151
00:10:25,118 --> 00:10:29,189
Good. And it's not a big deal, but just so
everyone's clear on the chain of command,

152
00:10:29,276 --> 00:10:32,668
I think you should address me
as Mr. McGill in front of the others.

153
00:10:32,758 --> 00:10:34,828
You know, Lynn, I'd rather not.

154
00:10:36,398 --> 00:10:39,548
Just a suggestion.
Anyway, I need your office.

155
00:10:39,637 --> 00:10:41,868
That's not a suggestion.

156
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:43,755
<i>- Fine.
- Mr. Buchanan?</i>

157
00:10:43,838 --> 00:10:45,908
<i>It's Jack Bauer on line one. </i>

158
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:52,111
- Is Curtis plugged into this call?
- I'm on, Bill. Put Jack through.

159
00:10:52,198 --> 00:10:54,951
<i>- You're both on with Jack Bauer.
- What happened?</i>

160
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:59,270
One of the hostiles got too close.
I had to end the transmission.

161
00:10:59,359 --> 00:11:03,795
- All right, we'll restart the countdown.
- Negative. Scrap the existing plan.

162
00:11:03,878 --> 00:11:06,951
- Find a new breach point.
- My men are in position.

163
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:11,270
They moved the hostages within the kill zone.
They'll be taken out with the crossfire.

164
00:11:11,359 --> 00:11:13,669
There's an emergency door south of gate 12.

165
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,671
It's unguarded. You should be able
to punch through with no opposition.

166
00:11:17,758 --> 00:11:20,227
I see it,
but I'm not comfortable with this entry.

167
00:11:20,319 --> 00:11:22,514
It's the only shot we've got.

168
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,274
- Are you there now?
- Yes, it's clear.

169
00:11:25,361 --> 00:11:29,638
I'm in a flank-two position.
I repeat: I am in a flank-two position.

170
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,473
Curtis, how long before
your teams can redeploy?

171
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,520
- About 20 minutes.
- The president's signing within 30 minutes.

172
00:11:36,601 --> 00:11:40,387
I'll go as fast as I can. Jack,
I'll call you when my men are in position.

173
00:11:40,479 --> 00:11:42,358
Copy that. I'll be standing by.

174
00:11:47,881 --> 00:11:51,270
Ivan and Ishmael, stay with the hostages.

175
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,911
The rest of you, come here.
Vlad, guard them.

176
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:15,074
You're doing great.

177
00:12:20,643 --> 00:12:21,870
- Manning.
- Buchanan.

178
00:12:21,962 --> 00:12:24,157
How long until your people can move in?

179
00:12:24,242 --> 00:12:26,314
- About 15 minutes.
- Why so long?

180
00:12:26,404 --> 00:12:30,156
When Jack changed breach point,
I modified everything, including explosives.

181
00:12:30,243 --> 00:12:31,801
They have to be repositioned.

182
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:34,603
Is it a mistake to act on this?
It might take too long.

183
00:12:34,683 --> 00:12:38,723
Jack knows our deadline. If he didn't think
it was worth a delay, he wouldn't call.

184
00:12:38,804 --> 00:12:42,159
- I trust him.
- All right, Curtis, 15 minutes.

185
00:12:42,243 --> 00:12:44,120
You have to make this happen.

186
00:12:44,204 --> 00:12:46,159
- I will.
- Call when you're in position.

187
00:12:46,243 --> 00:12:50,079
Mr. Buchanan,
Mr. McGill needs to see you in his office.

188
00:12:50,165 --> 00:12:53,634
- It'll have to wait. Tell him I'm busy.
- He said it had to be now.

189
00:12:53,723 --> 00:12:55,282
Fine.

190
00:13:02,726 --> 00:13:05,956
I'm settled in fine. If I need anything, I'll call.

191
00:13:06,045 --> 00:13:09,118
What is it? I'm trying to coordinate
this hostage situation.

192
00:13:09,206 --> 00:13:12,082
- Sit down, Mr. Buchanan.
- Stop with the "Mr. Buchanan".

193
00:13:12,165 --> 00:13:14,555
We need to get this assault in motion now.

194
00:13:14,646 --> 00:13:16,636
Sit down, Bill.

195
00:13:21,564 --> 00:13:24,126
I told the White House
the rescue is back on track.

196
00:13:24,206 --> 00:13:25,925
Thank you.

197
00:13:26,006 --> 00:13:30,875
I found it a little inappropriate talking about
an operation I hadn't personally reviewed,

198
00:13:30,966 --> 00:13:34,641
so before you send your men into
the terminal, I'd like to see the playbook.

199
00:13:34,726 --> 00:13:39,164
I can't have you micromanaging my work
here. If you wanna do my job, I'll go home.

200
00:13:39,248 --> 00:13:45,243
Please don't be defensive. I'm not
challenging you. I'm just trying to do my job.

201
00:13:45,326 --> 00:13:47,966
I'll have it sent to your laptop. Anything else?

202
00:13:48,046 --> 00:13:50,083
That's all for now.

203
00:13:52,446 --> 00:13:55,040
Bill.

204
00:13:55,128 --> 00:14:01,600
Fighting me isn't gonna increase our chances
of saving those people's lives.

205
00:14:11,609 --> 00:14:14,247
Lynn wants to see the revised assault plan.

206
00:14:14,329 --> 00:14:18,036
- Is he running point instead of you?
- He just wants to see the plan.

207
00:14:18,127 --> 00:14:24,079
Bill. Curtis confirmed his team will be ready
in ten minutes, based on Jack's new intel.

208
00:14:24,169 --> 00:14:28,322
<i> There is no word as to whether or not
the president will call off</i>

209
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:32,367
<i>the signing of the historic treaty agreement
of the United States and Russia,</i>

210
00:14:32,449 --> 00:14:35,760
<i>scheduled for just under an hour.
The terrorists... </i>

211
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:38,728
Any response from the White House
since the last killing?

212
00:14:38,809 --> 00:14:43,166
They confirmed the signing of the treaty
is going ahead as planned.

213
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:47,401
They won't capitulate as long as
they think their rescue attempt will succeed.

214
00:14:47,489 --> 00:14:52,804
Once we kill their men,
they'll realise their options have run out.

215
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:06,044
The only chance these people had
of being rescued is gone because of me.

216
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:10,886
People were gonna die here today.
That was their plan. This is not your fault.

217
00:15:10,971 --> 00:15:14,361
I'm the reason you went along with them.
If I wasn't here...

218
00:15:14,452 --> 00:15:16,443
Stop it.

219
00:15:17,851 --> 00:15:19,728
This is not over.

220
00:15:25,492 --> 00:15:28,404
<i> With no official rebuke
of the terrorists' demands,</i>

221
00:15:28,492 --> 00:15:32,566
<i>a statement from the White House confirmed
the president's position is unchanged</i>

222
00:15:32,653 --> 00:15:35,564
<i>and the treaty will be signed
within the hour as scheduled. </i>

223
00:15:35,652 --> 00:15:42,966
<i>It puts the lives of the 60 men, women and
children being held hostage in question... </i>

224
00:15:43,053 --> 00:15:46,886
Good news, sir. CTU has
re-established contact with Jack Bauer.

225
00:15:46,972 --> 00:15:50,170
The rescue operation is back on track.

226
00:15:50,253 --> 00:15:53,245
- But that's still no guarantee.
- Excuse me, sir?

227
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:56,005
The hostages may be killed
when we go in there.

228
00:15:56,093 --> 00:15:59,290
Let's be honest, that's more likely than not.

229
00:15:59,374 --> 00:16:01,171
We don't know that, sir.

230
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:05,724
- President Suvarov is waiting outside.
- He is?

231
00:16:05,814 --> 00:16:10,092
You're walking outside together onto
the stage. We all agreed to the protocol.

232
00:16:10,174 --> 00:16:12,768
- It's time already?
- Yes, sir.

233
00:16:19,253 --> 00:16:22,212
Mr. President. Shall we?

234
00:16:22,736 --> 00:16:25,408
My people tell me
the assault has been delayed.

235
00:16:25,495 --> 00:16:29,648
It's happening now. It will happen
before the treaty is signed, don't worry.

236
00:16:29,736 --> 00:16:31,929
Mr. President, like you,

237
00:16:32,015 --> 00:16:36,214
I have staked much of my political future
on the success of this treaty.

238
00:16:36,296 --> 00:16:38,446
If this rescue attempt fails,

239
00:16:38,535 --> 00:16:44,326
it will not only be rendered meaningless,
it will become a mockery.

240
00:16:44,415 --> 00:16:46,407
And so will we.

241
00:17:02,577 --> 00:17:05,694
I'm here to escort Mrs. Logan.
The ceremony's beginning.

242
00:17:05,777 --> 00:17:09,770
- She'll be out in a moment.
- May I... have a word?

243
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:16,177
You're aware Mrs. Logan was found
in one of the archive rooms.

244
00:17:16,257 --> 00:17:18,327
I don't know anything about that.

245
00:17:18,418 --> 00:17:20,533
Aaron Pierce said you lied to him.

246
00:17:20,617 --> 00:17:24,737
You said Mrs. Logan was in her room when
she was going through classified documents.

247
00:17:24,818 --> 00:17:28,606
I don't think you understand
how grave this situation is.

248
00:17:28,698 --> 00:17:31,370
- What do you mean?
- Mrs. Logan removed a document

249
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:34,690
that contains highly sensitive
intelligence protocols.

250
00:17:34,778 --> 00:17:38,657
- That's not what she said it was.
- What did she say she took?

251
00:17:38,738 --> 00:17:45,576
- I think that you should talk to her about this.
- This is important. What did she tell you?

252
00:17:45,659 --> 00:17:49,653
She said it was a transcript
of a call she had with David Palmer.

253
00:17:49,739 --> 00:17:52,776
I'm sure when she said that she believed it.

254
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:56,772
If this document finds its way into
the wrong hands, you'll be responsible.

255
00:17:56,858 --> 00:17:59,135
- I didn't take it.
- You aided and abetted.

256
00:17:59,219 --> 00:18:01,973
You'll not only lose your job,
you'll be prosecuted.

257
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:05,133
That's not fair. I tried to talk her out of this.

258
00:18:05,221 --> 00:18:09,850
All I'm asking is that you tell me...
where did she put it?

259
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:12,295
She has it with her. It's in her blouse.

260
00:18:12,379 --> 00:18:17,694
She said she wouldn't let it out of her sight
until she talked to the president about it.

261
00:18:18,181 --> 00:18:21,377
Walt? Sorry to keep you waiting.
I'm ready now.

262
00:18:33,341 --> 00:18:37,015
Presidents Logan and Suvarov
will each make statements,

263
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:39,900
which will be followed
by the signing of the treaty.

264
00:18:39,981 --> 00:18:43,769
How much time will there be
between the moment I step out on stage

265
00:18:43,861 --> 00:18:46,376
- and when I sign the document?
- Not long.

266
00:18:46,463 --> 00:18:49,295
Does CTU know
that's how long they have for the rescue?

267
00:18:49,382 --> 00:18:53,581
Yes, sir. They're completely synchronised
with what's going on here.

268
00:18:53,663 --> 00:18:57,860
I hope so.
The lives of those hostages depend on it.

269
00:18:59,822 --> 00:19:02,735
Today was to be the crowning achievement
of my presidency.

270
00:19:02,823 --> 00:19:07,657
Instead everybody's waiting to hear
what's gonna happen at the airport.

271
00:19:10,663 --> 00:19:14,372
- So how are you feeling?
- I'm fine. Don't worry about me.

272
00:19:14,463 --> 00:19:17,934
How come you just keep getting
better-looking as you get older?

273
00:19:18,025 --> 00:19:20,173
- I just keep getting older.
- What?

274
00:19:20,263 --> 00:19:24,973
You're the most beautiful First Lady
Pennsylvania Avenue has ever seen.

275
00:19:29,705 --> 00:19:34,140
Ladies and gentlemen,
President Logan and President Suvarov.

276
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:49,814
They're a minute and a half ahead of
schedule. Should we tell Curtis to speed up?

277
00:19:49,905 --> 00:19:53,864
No, Curtis is moving as fast as he can.
A call from me won't make him move faster.

278
00:19:53,945 --> 00:19:57,221
- I just thought he might like to...
- I said no, Chloe.

279
00:19:57,704 --> 00:20:00,538
The only way to make sure
the assault happens in time

280
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:02,980
is to try to slow down the signing.

281
00:20:04,825 --> 00:20:07,021
- What's wrong with Buchanan?
- Nothing.

282
00:20:07,106 --> 00:20:11,815
I think he just realises we're not
gonna be able to save the hostages.

283
00:20:27,139 --> 00:20:30,974
Before we begin the treaty signing,
I would like to address what's happening

284
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:33,050
just a few miles away from here.

285
00:20:34,219 --> 00:20:37,848
As you know,
terrorists have already taken innocent life

286
00:20:37,939 --> 00:20:42,252
in an attempt to stop this historic treaty
from being signed.

287
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:45,217
President Suvarov will not let this happen.

288
00:20:45,299 --> 00:20:48,099
I will not let this happen.

289
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:54,093
<i>- Yes, Mike?
- I should have heard from you by now.</i>

290
00:20:54,181 --> 00:20:56,376
<i>- Have you gone in yet?
- We're not quite ready.</i>

291
00:20:56,461 --> 00:20:59,691
You have to go in now.
The president's about to sign that treaty.

292
00:20:59,781 --> 00:21:01,816
We're pushing as hard as we can.

293
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:04,779
- Is there anything you can do?
- Like what?

294
00:21:04,862 --> 00:21:07,933
Can you stall things,
slow down the ceremony?

295
00:21:08,022 --> 00:21:11,697
Bill, the entire world
is watching this on live television.

296
00:21:11,782 --> 00:21:16,094
The presidents of the United States
and Russia are on stage now.

297
00:21:16,181 --> 00:21:19,413
This process is set in motion. No, I can't stall.

298
00:21:20,142 --> 00:21:23,178
- OK, I'll call you back.
- No, stay on the phone with me.

299
00:21:23,261 --> 00:21:27,415
- I need to know when your people go in.
- Yes, sir.

300
00:21:29,102 --> 00:21:34,938
This barbaric lawlessness that's taking place
at Ontario Airport only underscores the need,

301
00:21:35,022 --> 00:21:37,741
the necessity for this accord

302
00:21:37,824 --> 00:21:41,258
and for our continued
vigilance and commitment

303
00:21:41,342 --> 00:21:43,811
to fighting terrorism around the world.

304
00:21:43,903 --> 00:21:47,690
It looks like President Logan
is going through with the signing.

305
00:21:47,782 --> 00:21:50,058
He's not going to give in to your demands.

306
00:21:50,143 --> 00:21:53,261
<i>- Are you sure this is going to work?
- It will work.</i>

307
00:21:53,343 --> 00:21:58,258
The only reason he is so confident is that
he thinks his rescue attempt will save the day.

308
00:21:58,343 --> 00:22:03,702
- You're sure you can fend them off?
- As soon as CTU comes in that way,

309
00:22:03,783 --> 00:22:05,694
they'll all be killed.

310
00:22:05,784 --> 00:22:08,777
One of the president's aides
will then walk to the podium

311
00:22:08,865 --> 00:22:11,582
and whisper that there'll been no rescue.

312
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:17,535
That his signature on the treaty
will be the death warrant of the hostages.

313
00:22:17,625 --> 00:22:19,821
<i>That will stop him, I assure you. </i>

314
00:22:19,906 --> 00:22:25,457
Just in case you're wrong and he signs
the treaty, be ready to carry out your threat.

315
00:22:25,546 --> 00:22:30,095
Every one of my men is committed
to doing what needs to be done today.

316
00:22:30,185 --> 00:22:36,534
We've upgraded our estimate of the number
of wounded. I need ten more ambulances.

317
00:22:36,626 --> 00:22:38,264
Right.

318
00:22:38,345 --> 00:22:42,021
The new rescue operation is
radically changed from the initial approach.

319
00:22:42,106 --> 00:22:44,541
It was revised based on
new intel from Jack Bauer.

320
00:22:44,626 --> 00:22:47,185
Which he phoned in
after being dark for 20 minutes.

321
00:22:47,265 --> 00:22:48,666
I need to call you back.

322
00:22:48,747 --> 00:22:51,738
His explanation for being out of touch
is unsatisfactory.

323
00:22:51,826 --> 00:22:55,217
Jack said he was trying to avoid detection.
What are you suggesting?

324
00:22:55,307 --> 00:22:58,185
There's too many
unusual circumstances here.

325
00:22:58,266 --> 00:23:00,780
I want to understand it better before we go in.

326
00:23:00,866 --> 00:23:04,019
I need the transcripts of
your communication with Mr. Bauer.

327
00:23:04,107 --> 00:23:05,938
- To what end?
- Thoroughness.

328
00:23:06,027 --> 00:23:08,097
Just the raw transcripts will be fine.

329
00:23:08,188 --> 00:23:11,144
- Fine, I'll send them to you.
- Thank you.

330
00:23:12,147 --> 00:23:14,707
Curtis is on line three.

331
00:23:15,507 --> 00:23:19,263
- What's the situation?
- My men are in place and setting the charges.

332
00:23:19,348 --> 00:23:21,339
<i>- Any complications?
- No.</i>

333
00:23:21,429 --> 00:23:26,377
We're jamming the frequency so they can't
remote detonate. We should enter on target.

334
00:23:26,467 --> 00:23:28,902
Good. Stay on the line until we give the go.

335
00:23:28,988 --> 00:23:30,979
All right, Bill. Copy.

336
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:47,820
- O'Brian.
- Miss O'Brian, I'm trying to understand

337
00:23:47,909 --> 00:23:50,707
the transcript of Jack's last call,
and a few items...

338
00:23:50,789 --> 00:23:54,783
I'm busy trying to keep this revised assault
on schedule. What do you need?

339
00:23:54,869 --> 00:23:59,101
I don't want to slow you down, but
if you'd unlock volume five, I'd like to see...

340
00:23:59,189 --> 00:24:03,423
I don't need to know what you'd like to see.
OK, it's unlocked.

341
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:05,580
Good.

342
00:24:07,309 --> 00:24:10,745
- Lynn McGill is really slowing things down.
- That's his style.

343
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:12,627
I worked with him before.

344
00:24:12,709 --> 00:24:17,148
He usually loses 20% of his staff in the first
two days after taking control of a new office.

345
00:24:17,231 --> 00:24:20,941
- That many people quit?
- No, most of them were fired.

346
00:24:21,032 --> 00:24:24,909
In the volatile climate of the 21st century,

347
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:29,303
the sharing of deterrent technologies
by responsible powers

348
00:24:29,391 --> 00:24:33,305
is the surest guarantee of global peace.

349
00:24:33,392 --> 00:24:40,467
But let this accord be proof that
our two great nations stand together

350
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:45,627
in their commitment to fight
the enemies of peace and freedom.

351
00:24:52,472 --> 00:24:56,067
Achmed found Chevensky.
He's dead. He killed himself.

352
00:24:56,154 --> 00:24:58,588
- He found him in the baggage room.
- The keycard?

353
00:24:58,673 --> 00:25:02,187
Chevensky had it hidden
right where he said he would.

354
00:25:02,272 --> 00:25:04,263
Round up your men.

355
00:25:04,953 --> 00:25:08,992
The rest of you will work clean-up,
whoever makes it through that line of fire.

356
00:25:09,073 --> 00:25:13,351
Assume CTU is in body armour,
so go for the head shot.

357
00:25:14,314 --> 00:25:16,874
You and you.

358
00:25:16,953 --> 00:25:22,029
Guard the hostages.
Kill anyone who tries to break away.

359
00:25:23,473 --> 00:25:25,623
Head down!

360
00:25:44,114 --> 00:25:47,710
It is time the black night is broken

361
00:25:47,795 --> 00:25:50,548
by the dawning of the light of global peace.

362
00:26:04,075 --> 00:26:06,509
- Curtis.
- Jack, my men are in place.

363
00:26:06,595 --> 00:26:12,830
OK. Remember, I am in a flank-two position.
Make sure your men don't hit me.

364
00:26:12,915 --> 00:26:17,387
Roger that.
Ready to start the countdown on your word.

365
00:26:18,597 --> 00:26:20,588
<i> Jack?</i>

366
00:26:21,517 --> 00:26:24,986
- Move in at your discretion.
- All teams, we have a green light.

367
00:26:25,076 --> 00:26:27,751
Counting down from 60 seconds on my mark.

368
00:26:28,437 --> 00:26:31,554
Now. Jack, see you inside.

369
00:26:34,918 --> 00:26:36,908
Everyone, 60 seconds!

370
00:27:01,358 --> 00:27:02,507
Look out.

371
00:27:03,439 --> 00:27:06,076
- Stop the assault!
- Put Curtis on hold. What?

372
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:09,516
They're walking into a trap.
Look at the transcript.

373
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,351
When Jack issued a directive,
he said, "flank-two".

374
00:27:12,438 --> 00:27:17,639
- He was trying to give us his position.
- No, it's a duress code. He's under duress.

375
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:21,918
We ran Jack's calls through a protocol filter.
They would have found a duress signal.

376
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:28,190
That's current codes. When Jack was active,
"flank-two" was a duress code.

377
00:27:28,281 --> 00:27:29,918
Chloe, confirm that.

378
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:34,311
Jack is telling us he's being used
to send misinformation.

379
00:27:34,401 --> 00:27:36,833
If Curtis' teams go in now,
they'll be ambushed.

380
00:27:36,919 --> 00:27:38,956
- He's right.
- Curtis.

381
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,601
Abort the countdown. Repeat: abort, abort.

382
00:27:41,681 --> 00:27:45,150
Stand down. All teams stand down.
We're aborting entry.

383
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,233
We're standing down. What's wrong?

384
00:27:47,322 --> 00:27:49,709
We detected a duress code in Jack's call.

385
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:53,157
We have to assume the terrorists
are feeding him the information.

386
00:27:53,241 --> 00:27:57,120
Redeploy according to the original
assault plan and do not contact Jack.

387
00:27:57,202 --> 00:28:00,478
- If Jack contacts you, buy time.
- Copy that. We're moving.

388
00:28:00,561 --> 00:28:04,475
- You're gonna outflank the terrorists?
- Yes.

389
00:28:05,601 --> 00:28:07,353
That should work.

390
00:28:07,441 --> 00:28:11,561
All teams, reposition for entry through
the east and north gates. Plan Bravo.

391
00:28:11,642 --> 00:28:14,235
Plan Bravo, through
the east and north gates. Go.

392
00:28:14,321 --> 00:28:17,280
Acknowledged. Redeploying protocol one.

393
00:28:17,363 --> 00:28:22,233
- What's happening?
- Please step back to the vehicle. Now.

394
00:28:44,124 --> 00:28:48,084
They said 60 seconds two minutes ago.
What is CTU waiting for?

395
00:28:48,164 --> 00:28:51,873
I don't know. You heard what I heard.

396
00:28:54,285 --> 00:28:56,240
It's Jack.

397
00:28:57,044 --> 00:28:58,876
- Jack.
- What's happening?

398
00:28:58,965 --> 00:29:01,196
There was a malfunction
on the entry charges.

399
00:29:01,285 --> 00:29:03,240
- What's the time frame?
- Any minute.

400
00:29:03,325 --> 00:29:06,122
We're resetting the detonators. Stand by.

401
00:29:06,205 --> 00:29:08,560
Copy that.

402
00:29:10,245 --> 00:29:12,441
They're in position.

403
00:29:14,445 --> 00:29:17,165
Stay ready!

404
00:29:23,486 --> 00:29:26,364
<i>Presidents Logan and Suvarov
are preparing to sign the treaty,</i>

405
00:29:26,445 --> 00:29:29,916
<i>but what should be a moment of triumph
has become a grim test of wills. </i>

406
00:29:39,286 --> 00:29:40,515
Yeah?

407
00:29:40,607 --> 00:29:44,724
- Is it done?
- No. CTU hasn't attacked yet.

408
00:29:44,807 --> 00:29:47,082
You said it would happen before the signing.

409
00:29:47,167 --> 00:29:53,242
And you told me
the president would never let it go this far.

410
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:57,879
He's signing it.

411
00:29:57,967 --> 00:30:01,165
You have no choice. Kill them all.

412
00:30:05,449 --> 00:30:07,120
Fire!

413
00:30:43,849 --> 00:30:44,839
No!

414
00:30:59,289 --> 00:31:01,646
- You OK?
- Yeah.

415
00:31:02,212 --> 00:31:06,204
We've secured the terminal.
Besides the hostiles, no further casualties.

416
00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:09,840
- The remaining hostages are unharmed.
- Good work, Curtis.

417
00:31:09,931 --> 00:31:13,367
- Did you get that, Mike?
- Got it. Thanks, Bill. Good work.

418
00:31:28,412 --> 00:31:32,200
Mr. President, I have some good news.

419
00:31:32,292 --> 00:31:36,968
I have just received word
the crisis at the Ontario Airport is over.

420
00:31:37,052 --> 00:31:41,409
The rescue operation
that I authorised was successful.

421
00:31:41,492 --> 00:31:45,406
The terrorists have been captured or killed
and, best of all,

422
00:31:45,492 --> 00:31:50,169
it's all been accomplished
with no further loss of innocent life.

423
00:31:57,135 --> 00:31:59,886
Excuse me, agent. My name is Jack Bauer.

424
00:31:59,974 --> 00:32:02,613
- I know who you are, sir.
- Can I use your pick?

425
00:32:05,653 --> 00:32:09,044
This is Derek Huxley.
His mother is at the command post.

426
00:32:09,134 --> 00:32:11,727
- Could you please take him there?
- Of course.

427
00:32:11,814 --> 00:32:15,284
- What about you?
- Come here.

428
00:32:17,494 --> 00:32:18,768
Hey.

429
00:32:23,094 --> 00:32:25,211
I have to finish this.

430
00:32:27,414 --> 00:32:30,088
- Take care of your mother.
- Yeah.

431
00:32:30,175 --> 00:32:31,654
OK?

432
00:32:32,855 --> 00:32:34,652
Go.

433
00:32:47,416 --> 00:32:49,611
We're missing one.

434
00:32:52,055 --> 00:32:54,126
Everybody, I need your attention.

435
00:32:54,215 --> 00:32:56,366
We want a man
who was being held with you.

436
00:32:56,456 --> 00:33:00,165
He's a white male, mid-30s.
He was wearing a bright yellow tie.

437
00:33:00,255 --> 00:33:03,250
Did anyone see him leave? Anyone?

438
00:33:07,577 --> 00:33:09,532
Keep them here until I get back.

439
00:33:29,537 --> 00:33:31,653
Mom?

440
00:33:31,738 --> 00:33:33,887
Derek!

441
00:33:43,059 --> 00:33:45,254
They were gonna kill me.

442
00:33:48,338 --> 00:33:50,331
Jack saved my life.

443
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:54,014
He saved everyone's life.

444
00:33:54,099 --> 00:33:57,887
Ms Huxley,
I need you and your son to follow me.

445
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:01,456
- Can I see Jack Bauer?
- I'm sorry.

446
00:34:01,541 --> 00:34:06,613
I have instructions to transfer you to CTU.
This way, please.

447
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:12,011
Mr. President.

448
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:15,093
- Congratulations.
- Thank you very much.

449
00:34:20,741 --> 00:34:21,729
Thank you.

450
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:27,141
- Watch your step.
- I need to talk to you.

451
00:34:27,221 --> 00:34:30,098
Sweetheart, smile. It's over.

452
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:33,331
- I need a few minutes alone with you.
- Yes, soon.

453
00:34:33,421 --> 00:34:36,060
No, not soon, right now.
This is very important.

454
00:34:36,141 --> 00:34:40,341
Martha, when I'm done with this,
I'll call for you.

455
00:34:41,301 --> 00:34:43,417
- I promise.
- All right, this ends now.

456
00:34:43,501 --> 00:34:48,257
I have played my role without interfering.
Now it is time for you to attend to me.

457
00:34:48,341 --> 00:34:51,335
- And I will.
- Do not patronise me!

458
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:54,777
Something is going on.
I am not crying wolf again.

459
00:34:54,862 --> 00:34:55,933
Martha.

460
00:34:57,182 --> 00:34:59,332
Please.

461
00:34:59,422 --> 00:35:02,302
Do not ruin this moment for me.

462
00:35:04,104 --> 00:35:05,979
We'll talk later.

463
00:35:12,303 --> 00:35:13,622
Martha?

464
00:35:13,704 --> 00:35:17,012
- Everything all right?
- No, it's not all right.

465
00:35:17,102 --> 00:35:21,893
I have to talk to my husband. The situation
is more dangerous than he realises.

466
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:24,782
What situation is that?

467
00:35:25,782 --> 00:35:29,982
I'm sorry, Walt.
I can only talk to Charles about this.

468
00:35:45,345 --> 00:35:49,656
Colette confirms the area's been contained
with only minor injuries among the hostages.

469
00:35:49,744 --> 00:35:54,181
Good, thank you. Route all field updates
through Mr. McGill for the time being.

470
00:35:54,265 --> 00:35:56,095
OK.

471
00:35:57,665 --> 00:36:00,863
- Bill, if you have a moment...
- Lynn, uh...

472
00:36:00,945 --> 00:36:03,096
- I owe you an apology.
- For what?

473
00:36:03,186 --> 00:36:07,144
If you hadn't recognised the duress code
that Jack transmitted...

474
00:36:07,224 --> 00:36:10,583
Bill, you're the reason
I figured out what he was doing.

475
00:36:10,666 --> 00:36:14,055
- What do you mean?
- I admit I was suspicious of Mr. Bauer.

476
00:36:14,145 --> 00:36:18,582
You were so adamant about his integrity,
I looked to reconcile the contradiction.

477
00:36:18,666 --> 00:36:20,657
<i>So, thank you. </i>

478
00:36:24,068 --> 00:36:29,016
- Has Mr. Bauer been taken into custody?
- We'll debrief him here, but not as a suspect.

479
00:36:29,107 --> 00:36:32,416
He's not cleared in the deaths of
David Palmer and Michelle Dessler.

480
00:36:32,507 --> 00:36:35,385
Based on mitigating evidence
and Chloe's testimony,

481
00:36:35,467 --> 00:36:38,425
we're confident that Jack
was framed for those murders.

482
00:36:38,506 --> 00:36:41,341
I appreciate that,
but it doesn't change the situation.

483
00:36:41,429 --> 00:36:45,899
We have surveillance footage placing Jack
at the site of David Palmer's assassination.

484
00:36:45,988 --> 00:36:49,980
- Clearly it was doctored.
- Not according to preliminary tests.

485
00:36:50,067 --> 00:36:53,664
To get to the bottom of this,
Jack Bauer has a lot to answer for.

486
00:36:53,748 --> 00:36:56,136
Bring him in, now.

487
00:37:02,828 --> 00:37:06,617
- The rest of the terminal is clear.
- Yes, sir.

488
00:37:10,389 --> 00:37:12,620
Jack.

489
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:15,986
- It's good to see you again.
- Good to see you. We got a problem.

490
00:37:16,069 --> 00:37:18,662
A hostage is missing.
He was working with them.

491
00:37:18,749 --> 00:37:21,469
- Describe him, I'll take care of it.
- I'll help you.

492
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:25,223
You need to go back to CTU. Buchanan
gave orders to take you into custody.

493
00:37:25,309 --> 00:37:28,986
I watched Beresch give this guy a keycard.
Something else is going down.

494
00:37:29,071 --> 00:37:31,947
- We've got to find this guy now.
- I'll get right on it.

495
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:35,499
But I need you to go with these men. Please.

496
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:41,986
He's a white male, mid-30s.
He was wearing a dark suit and a yellow tie.

497
00:37:42,071 --> 00:37:44,584
- He's about 5'8".
- We'll find him.

498
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:46,866
OK. Thanks.

499
00:37:49,631 --> 00:37:51,940
- These are my weapons.
- OK.

500
00:37:52,031 --> 00:37:55,068
Alteri, Hutchison.
Possible sleeper among the hostages.

501
00:37:55,151 --> 00:37:58,700
We're looking for a Caucasian male,
5'8", dark suit, yellow tie.

502
00:38:14,712 --> 00:38:18,149
- Where have you been?
- We had a problem with Chevensky.

503
00:38:18,553 --> 00:38:20,702
- Where is he?
- Dead.

504
00:38:20,792 --> 00:38:22,510
You have the key?

505
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:05,473
Masks.

506
00:39:46,036 --> 00:39:50,109
<i>- Do you have the merchandise?
- Yes. We're moving the canisters out now. </i>

507
00:39:50,197 --> 00:39:54,794
Good. Transportation's been arranged.
Call me when you're out.

508
00:39:54,878 --> 00:39:56,787
I will.

509
00:40:09,837 --> 00:40:14,865
<i> Today is a historic day for both
the United States and Russia alike. </i>

510
00:40:14,957 --> 00:40:18,713
<i>Presidents Logan and Suvarov,
having signed the arms treaty agreement</i>

511
00:40:18,799 --> 00:40:22,074
<i>which will impact on arms reduction
between both countries,</i>

512
00:40:22,158 --> 00:40:25,230
<i>will now greet the press
to discuss the unprecedented weight</i>

513
00:40:25,318 --> 00:40:27,355
<i>of what has just been put in motion. </i>

514
00:40:27,438 --> 00:40:32,147
<i>This will be remembered as a significant day
for President Logan, perhaps... </i>

515
00:40:33,838 --> 00:40:38,071
Evelyn, did you have a chance
to speak to my husband?

516
00:40:38,159 --> 00:40:40,673
Aggh!
