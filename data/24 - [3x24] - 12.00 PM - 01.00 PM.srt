1
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,556
Alan Milliken's prescription bottle turned up
with Sherry's fingerprints on it.

2
00:00:18,686 --> 00:00:22,569
I can call Foxton and he can make this
disappear. You just give me the OK.

3
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:25,811
- David put you up to this, didn't he?
- Sherry, I...

4
00:00:29,258 --> 00:00:31,217
The police think I killed Alan.

5
00:00:31,341 --> 00:00:35,578
Well, I told you to keep your mouth shut.
It's nobody's fault but your own.

6
00:00:38,149 --> 00:00:40,791
Oh, my God. Sherry...

7
00:00:41,433 --> 00:00:42,993
No!

8
00:00:45,478 --> 00:00:47,436
You committed treason.

9
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,439
You facilitated the escape of a man

10
00:00:49,563 --> 00:00:52,319
who was responsible
for the death of Ryan Chappelle

11
00:00:52,446 --> 00:00:54,758
and almost a thousand civilians.

12
00:00:54,889 --> 00:00:58,488
With luck, the best
you can hope for is 20 years.

13
00:00:58,934 --> 00:01:02,135
Tell me how to find your couriers,
or I'll put her in that building.

14
00:01:02,258 --> 00:01:06,016
- She has nothing to do with this!
- Neither do the people in those body bags.

15
00:01:06,143 --> 00:01:09,856
When your daughter is infected,
I'm gonna make you watch her die.

16
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:11,103
Dad, stop them!

17
00:01:11,229 --> 00:01:15,864
- Stephen, you're out of time!
- Stop! Stop! I'll tell you!

18
00:01:16,315 --> 00:01:17,749
Where's the 11th vial?

19
00:01:17,877 --> 00:01:20,109
- Los Angeles.
- What's the target?

20
00:01:20,199 --> 00:01:25,074
He was told to select a public place where
maximum casualties would be inflicted.

21
00:01:25,205 --> 00:01:28,440
<i>Target has stopped moving.
The target has stopped.</i>

22
00:01:28,569 --> 00:01:31,371
Drop the bag!
Get on the ground, now! Don't move!

23
00:01:31,493 --> 00:01:34,408
- What's going on?
- Where is it? Where is it?

24
00:01:34,537 --> 00:01:35,891
- Where's what?
- Chase.

25
00:01:36,018 --> 00:01:39,458
- What are you doing? What's going on?
- I've got a signal.

26
00:01:40,624 --> 00:01:42,857
What are you looking for?

27
00:01:42,987 --> 00:01:47,065
It's just the transmitter.
This man is not Rabens.

28
00:01:47,192 --> 00:01:48,991
Shut the station down now!

29
00:01:57,284 --> 00:01:58,354
<i>This is Dessler.</i>

30
00:01:58,485 --> 00:02:02,848
It's Jack. We just lost Rabens. He dumped
the GPS beacon onto an innocent.

31
00:02:02,931 --> 00:02:05,971
- He still has the virus?
- We have to assume so.

32
00:02:06,094 --> 00:02:09,090
We're sweeping the station.
We've locked down the building.

33
00:02:09,218 --> 00:02:12,294
- We'll set up checkpoints.
- How will you find Rabens?

34
00:02:14,344 --> 00:02:19,219
We need Saunders to do an ID. Move him to
Chloe's station. We're setting up a live feed.

35
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:21,344
We'll be ready on our end.

36
00:02:21,993 --> 00:02:25,707
Michelle, Gael Ortega's wife Theresa's here.

37
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:30,602
All right, Jesse. Send her in.

38
00:02:34,729 --> 00:02:38,362
According to Chloe's statement,
you were working to bring down Saunders,

39
00:02:38,493 --> 00:02:42,332
even while you were complying
with his demands.

40
00:02:42,418 --> 00:02:48,136
Yeah, that's right. I gave Chloe a recording
of a conversation between Saunders and...

41
00:02:48,265 --> 00:02:54,268
Chloe also said you intentionally scrambled
the voice to slow down her progress.

42
00:02:54,392 --> 00:03:01,352
Tony, did you put Michelle's life
ahead of public safety or national security?

43
00:03:06,207 --> 00:03:07,961
Yes.

44
00:03:10,492 --> 00:03:12,246
I did.

45
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:19,381
They said he was exposed to a virus.

46
00:03:21,505 --> 00:03:23,783
Yeah, that's right.

47
00:03:29,274 --> 00:03:31,632
Did he suffer?

48
00:03:36,042 --> 00:03:39,676
No. He went quickly.

49
00:03:41,008 --> 00:03:42,204
<i>Gael...</i>

50
00:03:47,015 --> 00:03:49,852
He was a hero.

51
00:03:51,821 --> 00:03:57,778
He tried to stop the virus being released,
and when it was, he just kept working.

52
00:04:01,112 --> 00:04:03,869
Till the end.

53
00:04:08,962 --> 00:04:10,362
Thank you.

54
00:04:11,525 --> 00:04:13,483
Thank you.

55
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:21,367
Can I pick up his things?

56
00:04:21,497 --> 00:04:23,330
Of course.

57
00:04:23,459 --> 00:04:27,139
I'll see what I can do.

58
00:04:27,264 --> 00:04:29,382
Wait here.

59
00:04:30,548 --> 00:04:33,623
- Kim?
- Yes, Michelle?

60
00:04:33,751 --> 00:04:36,633
That's Mrs Ortega. Gael's wife.

61
00:04:36,755 --> 00:04:41,676
I need you to take her to his station to
pick up his personal belongings. Thank you.

62
00:05:08,914 --> 00:05:11,111
<i>Sit him down.</i>

63
00:05:15,241 --> 00:05:16,197
Hello?

64
00:05:16,323 --> 00:05:19,477
<i>I need you.
Saunders is here to ID Rabens.</i>

65
00:05:19,606 --> 00:05:21,361
Well, I'm with Mrs Ortega.

66
00:05:21,449 --> 00:05:26,734
Michelle said I could reassign anyone, and
I want you. Please don't make me ask again.

67
00:05:26,855 --> 00:05:30,489
Fine. I'll get Barry to watch her.

68
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:41,148
- Barry?
- Yeah?

69
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:46,552
Please watch Mrs Ortega
while she gathers Gael's things.

70
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,478
Sure.

71
00:05:48,601 --> 00:05:52,154
- Take as much time as you need.
- Thanks.

72
00:06:01,136 --> 00:06:05,180
- Excuse me, Barry. Can I get a signature?
- Sure.

73
00:06:07,904 --> 00:06:09,658
Thanks.

74
00:06:09,787 --> 00:06:12,224
<i>- Anything else?
- No, that's all.</i>

75
00:06:13,111 --> 00:06:17,234
Sir, if you'll just step up
to the monitor. Right here.

76
00:06:17,356 --> 00:06:19,508
Chin up, please, sir.

77
00:06:23,203 --> 00:06:25,161
Chin up.

78
00:06:27,488 --> 00:06:30,051
<i>Move in closer on 2A.</i>

79
00:06:30,131 --> 00:06:32,089
<i>- Jack, it's me.
- Any matches?</i>

80
00:06:32,214 --> 00:06:34,127
- Nothing yet.
- How far have you got?

81
00:06:34,256 --> 00:06:36,614
We've gone through
the first two sets of photos.

82
00:06:36,739 --> 00:06:39,860
<i>- Next group is uploading. Stand by.
- It's not him.</i>

83
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:42,580
- Is there anything on this page?
- Try 3B closer up.

84
00:06:44,588 --> 00:06:47,550
No, that's not him.

85
00:06:49,314 --> 00:06:50,065
No.

86
00:06:56,122 --> 00:06:57,921
<i>- No.
- Do we have a match?</i>

87
00:06:58,045 --> 00:07:01,485
- Negative, Jack.
- Don't see him anywhere.

88
00:07:01,609 --> 00:07:03,567
- Next.
- Yeah.

89
00:07:05,373 --> 00:07:07,047
Head up, sir.

90
00:07:16,066 --> 00:07:17,899
- Bring up 5B.
- No.

91
00:07:18,028 --> 00:07:20,101
- Are you sure?
- He's not here.

92
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:22,350
Bring up the next page.

93
00:07:22,434 --> 00:07:25,509
What about this one? No?

94
00:07:30,123 --> 00:07:32,924
- He killed Gael! Don't you understand?
- I need medical!

95
00:07:33,046 --> 00:07:36,087
- What's going on over there?
- Saunders has been shot.

96
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:38,204
What are you talking about?
Who shot him?

97
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:42,411
Gael's wife. Hold on, Jack.
I need medical here now!

98
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:46,331
<i>- What is his condition?
- Looks critical.</i>

99
00:07:46,463 --> 00:07:50,062
Do everything you can to keep him alive.
He's our only connection to Rabens.

100
00:07:50,187 --> 00:07:52,579
- Chase.
- Yeah?

101
00:07:57,235 --> 00:07:59,308
<i>- Jack?
- Talk to me.</i>

102
00:07:59,438 --> 00:08:02,080
- He didn't make it.
- Son of a bitch.

103
00:08:02,161 --> 00:08:06,479
We'll get back to you.
Saunders has just been shot. He's dead.

104
00:08:06,607 --> 00:08:10,001
<i>Don't move, ma'am. Don't move.</i>

105
00:08:10,131 --> 00:08:13,093
<i>He did kill... Gael...</i>

106
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:33,752
<i>The service
is experiencing significant delays.</i>

107
00:08:35,802 --> 00:08:38,273
From the couriers and our own intelligence,

108
00:08:38,405 --> 00:08:43,644
we've been able to confirm that Saunders
was the sole architect of today's actions.

109
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:49,176
If we catch this last man, Arthur Rabens,
that'll be the end of the threat.

110
00:08:49,298 --> 00:08:53,694
And if not, we're back to square one
and the virus is back on the market.

111
00:08:54,584 --> 00:08:56,896
Find him.

112
00:08:57,708 --> 00:09:02,070
- Hello, Wayne.
- Joseph, could you give us a minute?

113
00:09:02,193 --> 00:09:05,109
- Thank you, Joseph.
- Mr President.

114
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:15,088
Well? Did you get the prescription bottle
from Sherry's house?

115
00:09:15,209 --> 00:09:17,601
Yeah.

116
00:09:17,732 --> 00:09:20,408
Well, that's good.

117
00:09:25,021 --> 00:09:26,775
David...

118
00:09:29,506 --> 00:09:33,265
David, something horrible happened
and I don't...

119
00:09:38,317 --> 00:09:40,675
Sherry's dead.

120
00:09:44,925 --> 00:09:46,883
What?

121
00:09:51,292 --> 00:09:53,729
How?

122
00:09:53,855 --> 00:10:00,416
Julia. She came in and she killed her,
and then she turned the gun on herself.

123
00:10:04,428 --> 00:10:06,865
They're both dead?

124
00:10:07,912 --> 00:10:09,871
Yeah.

125
00:10:25,213 --> 00:10:30,247
Listen, I'm not gonna try to pretend
that we can just put this behind us.

126
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:36,940
But the fact is... The fact is that
politically we're free of everything.

127
00:10:37,067 --> 00:10:41,589
Free of Milliken's extortion, his death.
Free of Sherry's involvement.

128
00:10:44,116 --> 00:10:47,077
You're thinking of the politics of this?

129
00:10:48,801 --> 00:10:53,038
The mother of my children
has just been murdered.

130
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:56,607
And the woman that I love
just killed herself in front of me.

131
00:10:58,853 --> 00:11:02,008
I understand how you feel.

132
00:11:02,137 --> 00:11:07,137
But there's a story here, David.
There's a story that can tie this all together.

133
00:11:08,305 --> 00:11:10,696
Alan Milliken was having
an affair with Sherry.

134
00:11:10,828 --> 00:11:13,391
Julia found out
and then she killed them both.

135
00:11:13,511 --> 00:11:16,666
- Oh, no. I don't wanna hear it.
- Your emotions are clouding...

136
00:11:16,795 --> 00:11:18,115
No!

137
00:11:27,848 --> 00:11:30,810
David, please, just listen to me.

138
00:11:33,174 --> 00:11:35,293
Leave me alone.

139
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:40,139
David, please...

140
00:12:01,568 --> 00:12:03,162
Jeannie?

141
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:05,933
<i>Yes, Mr President?</i>

142
00:12:06,054 --> 00:12:11,453
Would you get my son and my daughter
on a conference line, please?

143
00:12:11,821 --> 00:12:14,976
Separate the crowd into units of ten,
an officer to each unit.

144
00:12:15,105 --> 00:12:20,060
That officer's to make sure no one leaves
that unit unless authorized by a CTU agent.

145
00:12:20,191 --> 00:12:20,942
I understand.

146
00:12:21,072 --> 00:12:25,593
We're also gonna search every passenger.
Then we're gonna verify their identification.

147
00:12:25,717 --> 00:12:28,360
- Be here all day.
- Not if we find him.

148
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:32,638
Initiate another search of the station,
including the tracks a mile in each direction.

149
00:12:32,766 --> 00:12:35,681
- Thank you.
- Yes, sir.

150
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:40,764
Jack, we're locked down.
We've got two men at every exit.

151
00:12:40,856 --> 00:12:42,814
Good.

152
00:12:43,979 --> 00:12:47,977
- Is there anything else we can do right now?
- Not until we get an ID on Rabens.

153
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:55,473
Jack, listen.

154
00:12:55,553 --> 00:13:00,998
About Mexico. I hope you know I understand
you were just doing your job.

155
00:13:02,962 --> 00:13:07,324
Look, it took me a long time to understand
that if you wanna do this job well,

156
00:13:07,407 --> 00:13:09,799
you have to stay detached.

157
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:12,288
If you can accept that, you'll be fine.

158
00:13:12,413 --> 00:13:14,452
Yeah.

159
00:13:14,576 --> 00:13:17,218
Well, I have accepted it.

160
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:20,460
That's why I'm thinking after today I'm done.

161
00:13:23,066 --> 00:13:25,424
I don't wanna be detached, Jack.

162
00:13:25,549 --> 00:13:28,305
Not from Kim, not from my daughter.

163
00:13:33,318 --> 00:13:36,553
I'm gonna request a transfer to the floor.

164
00:13:36,683 --> 00:13:39,484
Are you sure about this?

165
00:13:39,606 --> 00:13:41,964
I'd still be serving my country.

166
00:13:42,089 --> 00:13:45,802
I'd take care of the people I care about.

167
00:13:45,934 --> 00:13:48,291
I owe them that, Jack.

168
00:13:49,378 --> 00:13:50,938
What'd Kim say?

169
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:55,775
I think she's willing to give it a try
as long as I'm not in field ops.

170
00:13:56,827 --> 00:13:59,390
What do you think, Jack?

171
00:14:00,431 --> 00:14:03,427
I'm the last person you should be asking.

172
00:14:05,277 --> 00:14:07,429
This is between you and Kim.

173
00:14:08,361 --> 00:14:10,752
Whatever you choose I would support.

174
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:17,251
You're a good man, Chase.

175
00:14:22,698 --> 00:14:25,454
Let's go. Moving in.
Form a line here, sir.

176
00:14:25,581 --> 00:14:30,707
Fast. We'll be checking your belongings
and your identification.

177
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:34,228
Sir, please. At the end.
Thank you, sir.

178
00:15:24,812 --> 00:15:28,092
You only have nine people here.
Where's the man in the brown jacket?

179
00:15:28,216 --> 00:15:31,930
- I don't know.
- We have a passenger unaccounted for.

180
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:43,303
This is Jack Bauer. We have two
LAPD officers down at the northwest exit.

181
00:15:43,435 --> 00:15:46,714
I need transportation
to meet me on the corner.

182
00:15:51,324 --> 00:15:53,282
<i>Help!</i>

183
00:15:55,889 --> 00:15:58,851
- I'm a federal agent. What happened?
- A carjacking.

184
00:15:58,973 --> 00:16:01,615
- Did you get a make on the car?
- No.

185
00:16:01,696 --> 00:16:06,936
This is Jack Bauer. We've got
a civilian casualty on Hope and 7th.

186
00:16:07,063 --> 00:16:11,859
- Did you see which way the car went?
- He went straight down there.

187
00:16:11,989 --> 00:16:14,950
I need that transportation now.

188
00:16:27,007 --> 00:16:30,321
Michelle, this is Jack.
Rabens is out of the station.

189
00:16:30,451 --> 00:16:33,127
He was headed east on 5th Street
five minutes ago.

190
00:16:33,254 --> 00:16:36,330
I need to ID a stolen car.
Get me a DMV readout on a...

191
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:40,661
- Frank Cassar.
- Then set up roadblocks at a five-mile radius.

192
00:16:40,783 --> 00:16:46,103
Coordinate sat surveillance,
traffic cameras, everything we've got.

193
00:17:07,415 --> 00:17:08,930
Yeah?

194
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:13,416
All right. I'll be right out.

195
00:17:14,424 --> 00:17:16,621
I need to step out.

196
00:17:29,842 --> 00:17:33,316
Brad, Rabens is gone. He got through
the perimeter at the MTA station.

197
00:17:33,446 --> 00:17:36,647
- How the hell did that happen?
- Doesn't matter how. It happened.

198
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:39,527
We identified the vehicle he carjacked,
a blue Malibu.

199
00:17:39,654 --> 00:17:42,330
We set up a roadblock
and uplinked traffic cams,

200
00:17:42,457 --> 00:17:46,250
but I need Tony to coordinate
the data flow with Tactical.

201
00:17:47,383 --> 00:17:52,019
There's no downside here, Brad. He's not
a flight risk, and he'd be a major asset.

202
00:17:52,149 --> 00:17:55,987
- I could be brought up on charges.
- We can't lose Rabens.

203
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:06,436
So unless you wanna take responsibility
and run Tactical yourself...

204
00:18:07,167 --> 00:18:09,843
You're wasting time, Brad.

205
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:18,895
We need you on the floor.

206
00:18:27,832 --> 00:18:31,272
<i>- Come on, Chloe, where's Rabens?
- Just a second, Jack.</i>

207
00:18:31,396 --> 00:18:35,758
I think I've got a match. A light green Malibu,
intersection of 5th and Vanowen.

208
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:38,318
We're only a few blocks away.
We'll go there now.

209
00:18:38,444 --> 00:18:42,601
- Adam, get me a closer shot of that plate.
- Doing it now.

210
00:18:42,689 --> 00:18:46,050
I'm back in play, Jack.
Michelle got me up to speed.

211
00:18:46,174 --> 00:18:49,853
<i>- Tony, how long till the plate's ID'd?
- Adam, do we have a match?</i>

212
00:18:50,859 --> 00:18:53,696
- Yes. It's him. The plates match.
- Jack, it's him.

213
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:56,863
- Where's he headed?
- East on Del Mar, just past Franklin.

214
00:18:56,987 --> 00:19:00,461
It's the next block. Right there, right there!

215
00:19:05,116 --> 00:19:08,591
We got him. He's headed south
on Manning. We need backup.

216
00:19:08,721 --> 00:19:09,757
Copy that.

217
00:19:35,713 --> 00:19:40,189
- Tony, where's that backup coming in from?
- From the east and the south.

218
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:43,473
We just made a right.
We're headed west on De Soto.

219
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:51,611
Move that thing now!

220
00:20:05,108 --> 00:20:09,790
We've been cut off. He made a right onto
Lawndale. We're three blocks behind him.

221
00:20:09,914 --> 00:20:13,628
Three vehicles are ready to cut him off.
We're gonna corner him.

222
00:20:20,847 --> 00:20:25,324
<i>- We got him pinned on Chamberlain.
- Keep him there. We're two blocks away.</i>

223
00:20:42,673 --> 00:20:45,635
<i>He ran into the middle school
on Chamberlain, main entrance.</i>

224
00:20:45,757 --> 00:20:49,310
Tony, we're coming up
on the middle school now.

225
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:58,483
He's in the school. I'll get back to you.

226
00:20:58,612 --> 00:21:01,972
Tell the arriving teams to secure the exits.
We cannot evacuate.

227
00:21:02,097 --> 00:21:04,898
We run the risk of losing him. Let's move.

228
00:21:12,069 --> 00:21:14,380
Haynes, cover the west exit.

229
00:21:27,607 --> 00:21:30,569
Get anything? Cover your exit.
No one leaves this building.

230
00:21:30,691 --> 00:21:33,572
Chase, take your man.
Search the auditorium.

231
00:21:54,439 --> 00:21:58,232
<i>All students are to remain
in their classrooms and lock their doors.</i>

232
00:22:00,286 --> 00:22:04,364
<i>I repeat, remain in the classrooms
and lock the doors.</i>

233
00:23:14,535 --> 00:23:18,978
Chase, it's Jack.
Second floor is clear. Do you copy?

234
00:23:19,101 --> 00:23:19,898
Chase?

235
00:24:11,564 --> 00:24:13,318
No!

236
00:24:43,843 --> 00:24:48,603
Now, Chase, just lay still.
Everything's gonna be all right.

237
00:24:52,253 --> 00:24:56,888
This is the only thing I could do
to keep him from escaping with the virus.

238
00:24:59,021 --> 00:25:01,584
Don't waste your time. It's not coming off.

239
00:25:01,664 --> 00:25:04,785
- What are you talking about?
- Rabens didn't even try to remove it.

240
00:25:04,908 --> 00:25:08,302
If he could unlock it, he would have.

241
00:25:08,432 --> 00:25:11,906
Tony, Rabens is dead.
The virus is in our possession.

242
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:16,470
The dispersal device has been activated.
I've got no idea how long we've got.

243
00:25:16,602 --> 00:25:19,278
Find a secure container, anything airtight.

244
00:25:19,405 --> 00:25:22,446
I can't do that.
The device is attached to Chase's wrist.

245
00:25:22,529 --> 00:25:24,089
- What?
- I'll explain later.

246
00:25:24,211 --> 00:25:28,209
Put me in touch with one of the teams
that have disarmed the device already.

247
00:25:28,336 --> 00:25:30,899
- I'll get back to you.
- Hurry.

248
00:25:32,261 --> 00:25:34,698
Just support the device.

249
00:25:37,707 --> 00:25:40,783
I don't know how this is gonna turn out,
but tell Kim I'm sorry.

250
00:25:40,911 --> 00:25:43,348
Whatever you gotta tell Kim, tell her yourself.

251
00:25:43,474 --> 00:25:47,233
We'll get through this.
You just stay with me. We'll get through this.

252
00:25:51,684 --> 00:25:54,885
<i>- Jack, I'm patching you through.
- OK.</i>

253
00:25:55,008 --> 00:25:56,158
Roger Summers here.

254
00:25:56,289 --> 00:26:00,732
Roger, my partner had to fasten
the dispersal device to his wrist.

255
00:26:00,855 --> 00:26:03,976
I need to figure out how to disarm the timer
or remove the clamp.

256
00:26:04,059 --> 00:26:07,499
The clamp's titanium, and it's wired
to the tamper-proof mechanism.

257
00:26:07,623 --> 00:26:09,502
Fine, then let's disarm the timer.

258
00:26:09,625 --> 00:26:14,466
- There's a plate at the end. Open that up.
- OK, I see it.

259
00:26:16,353 --> 00:26:19,110
Chase, stay with me. Stay with me!

260
00:26:23,963 --> 00:26:27,596
I've got the timer.
Three minutes 51 seconds, counting down.

261
00:26:27,727 --> 00:26:32,966
You should see six wires to the left.
Separate them from each other.

262
00:26:38,901 --> 00:26:42,818
- OK. Done.
- The furthest to the left should be red.

263
00:26:42,905 --> 00:26:45,821
Cut it without making contact
with the others.

264
00:26:58,724 --> 00:27:01,082
You ready?

265
00:27:06,814 --> 00:27:09,285
I cut the red wire,
but it's still counting down.

266
00:27:09,417 --> 00:27:15,819
The timer will stop with the next cut. Locate
the green wire. It's in the group to the right.

267
00:27:23,354 --> 00:27:26,190
Roger, I don't have a green wire.

268
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:33,116
- What color wires do you have?
- Orange, yellow, black and purple.

269
00:27:34,768 --> 00:27:40,884
The devices don't match. Don't panic. And
don't cut any wires until we figure this out.

270
00:27:41,015 --> 00:27:44,216
Hurry. We're running out of time.

271
00:27:47,703 --> 00:27:51,747
- Jack, you need to go.
- I'm not going anywhere without you.

272
00:28:11,652 --> 00:28:15,444
- Do it.
- They're gonna call back.

273
00:28:15,576 --> 00:28:18,413
- You have to.
- They're gonna call back!

274
00:28:32,717 --> 00:28:34,675
It's OK.

275
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:54,733
Man down in the third-floor science lab,
northeast corner of the building,

276
00:29:54,856 --> 00:29:57,817
requiring medical assistance.
Emergency! Now!

277
00:30:52,164 --> 00:30:57,119
- Could you give us a minute, please?
- Sure thing. Come on.

278
00:31:02,136 --> 00:31:05,177
What's going on?

279
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:09,982
I'm back in custody.
Hammond's taking me down to Federal.

280
00:31:11,187 --> 00:31:15,470
No. They can't do this, not after everything
you've accomplished today.

281
00:31:16,433 --> 00:31:21,958
Michelle, I put your wellbeing
above the country's.

282
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,677
Nothing anybody can say
will ever change that fact.

283
00:31:24,763 --> 00:31:29,000
But they can't... they can't put you in prison.

284
00:31:29,569 --> 00:31:35,014
Yes, they can. And they will,
for a long time, believe me.

285
00:31:35,136 --> 00:31:36,810
Tony, don't talk like this.

286
00:31:36,938 --> 00:31:41,620
- I can't... I won't give up on you...
- Michelle, come on. Please, don't do this.

287
00:31:52,797 --> 00:31:55,553
Baby, you're alive.

288
00:31:56,762 --> 00:31:59,518
And nobody else got hurt
because of what I did.

289
00:31:59,645 --> 00:32:02,607
That's more than I hoped for.

290
00:32:04,050 --> 00:32:06,773
I can live with that.

291
00:32:07,775 --> 00:32:11,294
<i>- Even in prison.
- Tony, it's time.</i>

292
00:32:31,684 --> 00:32:33,916
- Thank you, Doctor.
- Sure.

293
00:32:41,696 --> 00:32:46,058
<i>- This is Bauer.
- Agent Bauer, please hold for the president.</i>

294
00:32:46,141 --> 00:32:47,974
- Jack?
- Mr President.

295
00:32:48,103 --> 00:32:54,106
I wanted to thank you personally, not only for
what you've done today, but for everything.

296
00:32:54,231 --> 00:32:58,548
This country continues to owe you
a great debt of gratitude.

297
00:32:58,676 --> 00:33:00,589
Thank you, sir.

298
00:33:00,718 --> 00:33:03,395
I put you in an unimaginable position
earlier today

299
00:33:03,522 --> 00:33:06,962
when I asked you to take the life
of one of your colleagues.

300
00:33:07,086 --> 00:33:10,127
Please forgive me for that.

301
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:15,889
Mr President, there's nothing to forgive.
It's what had to be done.

302
00:33:16,017 --> 00:33:18,853
And it wasn't the only sacrifice made today.

303
00:33:20,903 --> 00:33:22,861
I understand.

304
00:33:24,146 --> 00:33:27,746
- How's Agent Edmunds doing?
- He's in surgery now.

305
00:33:27,871 --> 00:33:31,185
It's gonna be a few days before we know
whether or not he can use his hand.

306
00:33:33,438 --> 00:33:37,675
When he's strong enough to talk,
I'd like to thank him personally.

307
00:33:38,283 --> 00:33:40,356
He would appreciate that, sir.

308
00:33:40,486 --> 00:33:43,562
You know, Jack, men and women like you...

309
00:33:44,651 --> 00:33:47,293
your courage
and level of commitment humbles me.

310
00:33:48,095 --> 00:33:52,970
Thank you. I'll let everyone know at CTU
that you appreciated the job they did.

311
00:33:53,101 --> 00:33:55,572
And, Jack, there's one more thing.

312
00:33:55,704 --> 00:33:59,304
Please don't discuss this with anyone
until it becomes public,

313
00:33:59,429 --> 00:34:03,905
but I wanted you
to hear it from me personally.

314
00:34:03,994 --> 00:34:07,912
I've decided not to seek re-election.

315
00:34:08,039 --> 00:34:10,397
This will be my only term.

316
00:34:10,522 --> 00:34:14,155
<i>I hope you don't mind me saying so,
but I think you're making a mistake.</i>

317
00:34:14,287 --> 00:34:17,202
Mistake or not, it's what I've decided.

318
00:34:18,692 --> 00:34:22,484
When I'm a private citizen,
I hope we can become better friends.

319
00:34:22,617 --> 00:34:25,373
That would be an honor, sir.

320
00:34:26,621 --> 00:34:29,058
Thank you, Jack.

321
00:34:29,184 --> 00:34:31,178
Thank you, Mr President.

322
00:34:41,519 --> 00:34:43,478
Come.

323
00:34:43,562 --> 00:34:46,763
Mr President, the motorcade's ready.

324
00:34:46,886 --> 00:34:49,244
Thank you, Aaron.

325
00:35:01,383 --> 00:35:03,741
Thank you, Wayne.

326
00:35:31,139 --> 00:35:32,779
Right in there.

327
00:35:34,463 --> 00:35:36,821
- Dad.
- Hey.

328
00:35:46,677 --> 00:35:48,671
Is Chase gonna be OK?

329
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,158
The doctors are very optimistic.

330
00:35:51,283 --> 00:35:54,882
- They got him into surgery very quickly.
- Thank God.

331
00:35:55,007 --> 00:35:56,966
Come here.

332
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:09,704
I hear you and Chase
are gonna make some changes.

333
00:36:09,825 --> 00:36:13,903
- I'm very happy for you.
- I thought you were gonna be upset.

334
00:36:15,712 --> 00:36:21,909
I'm so proud of you. I'm sure whatever
choices you make will be the right ones.

335
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,318
Thank you, Dad.

336
00:36:24,443 --> 00:36:26,356
Thank you.

337
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:31,086
You gonna be OK?

338
00:36:33,013 --> 00:36:35,769
Yeah, I'm gonna be fine.

339
00:36:37,178 --> 00:36:40,492
There are some things I have to do...

340
00:36:40,622 --> 00:36:43,059
but I'm gonna be fine.

341
00:36:44,266 --> 00:36:48,264
- Are you gonna wait here for Chase?
- Yeah.

342
00:36:48,391 --> 00:36:50,954
I've gotta leave for a little while. I'll be back.

343
00:36:51,035 --> 00:36:52,628
OK.

344
00:36:52,757 --> 00:36:55,718
- I love you.
- I love you too, Dad.

345
00:38:33,557 --> 00:38:35,915
<i>Jack, you there?</i>

346
00:38:40,686 --> 00:38:42,440
<i>Jack?</i>

347
00:38:46,253 --> 00:38:49,488
<i>- This is Jack.
- I just got a call from District.</i>

348
00:38:49,617 --> 00:38:55,574
<i>They've started interrogating Saunders'
courier. We could use your help.</i>

349
00:38:59,469 --> 00:39:02,032
<i>- Jack?
- Yeah.</i>

350
00:39:06,157 --> 00:39:08,879
<i>Jack, did you copy?</i>

351
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,358
I'm on my way.
