1
00:00:13,506 --> 00:00:18,881
Right now, terrorists are plotting
to assassinate a presidential candidate.

2
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:21,722
My teenage daughter is missing.

3
00:00:21,806 --> 00:00:25,341
And people that I work with
may be involved in both.

4
00:00:26,102 --> 00:00:32,306
I'm Federal Agent Jack Bauer. Today
is going to be the longest day of my life.

5
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:56,943
Senator, stay here
until I secure the area.

6
00:01:57,029 --> 00:01:58,940
- Fine.
- Let's get him out.

7
00:01:59,029 --> 00:02:01,496
All right, we're on the move.

8
00:02:25,384 --> 00:02:27,579
Berkin, stay with the senator.

9
00:02:32,263 --> 00:02:34,458
Hey, hold on, there.

10
00:02:35,903 --> 00:02:38,416
Senator, we're clear. Let's go.

11
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,935
Let's go!

12
00:02:56,419 --> 00:02:58,410
Let's go. Inside.

13
00:03:03,898 --> 00:03:05,535
- Frank Simes?
- This is Bauer?

14
00:03:05,617 --> 00:03:07,209
- Yes.
- You gotta help me out.

15
00:03:07,297 --> 00:03:10,972
I understand you're obliged to follow
procedure, but please hear me out.

16
00:03:11,056 --> 00:03:13,729
- I did this intentionally.
- That I believe.

17
00:03:13,816 --> 00:03:16,932
- I didn't mean it like that.
- You called me at 6.30 this morning

18
00:03:17,016 --> 00:03:19,575
to get clearance to bring
a weapon to the breakfast.

19
00:03:19,655 --> 00:03:24,728
Exactly. If I wanted to shoot someone, I
would've used my own gun. I didn't need his.

20
00:03:25,694 --> 00:03:29,242
- What happened?
- I saw him, walked over, identified myself.

21
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:31,563
When I said I had to take him in,
he went for my gun.

22
00:03:31,653 --> 00:03:34,451
I had to create a scene
to get Palmer out of the room.

23
00:03:34,532 --> 00:03:38,729
If you wanted to get him out of the room,
why didn't you tell us there was a problem?

24
00:03:38,812 --> 00:03:42,201
- I'm working under a restricted mandate.
- Cut the crap, Bauer.

25
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:45,601
- Your own people called you in as a suspect.
- What?

26
00:03:45,691 --> 00:03:49,968
Tony Almeida from your office called one of
my men and told us you presented a threat.

27
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:54,201
Almeida doesn't have the same information
that I've got. You're running out of time.

28
00:03:54,289 --> 00:03:58,076
You had a shooter disguised
as a photographer in here. He's escaped.

29
00:03:58,169 --> 00:04:00,557
Palmer's life is still in danger.

30
00:04:04,768 --> 00:04:08,237
Frank, don't go.
I've gotta get outta here! Come on!

31
00:04:09,727 --> 00:04:14,753
Get me Palmer's security. And a list of
photographers who checked in this morning.

32
00:04:14,845 --> 00:04:16,756
Yeah, I'll wait.

33
00:04:22,564 --> 00:04:27,000
You sold classified information.
People are dead cos of you.

34
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:31,201
The only chance you got of
helpin' yourself is by talkin' to us now.

35
00:04:32,362 --> 00:04:35,354
Jamey! The guy you work for,
what's his name?

36
00:04:36,882 --> 00:04:40,430
I call him Gaines.
I don't know if that's his real name.

37
00:04:41,121 --> 00:04:44,908
Do you have any idea where
he might be holding Teri and Kim?

38
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,909
Jamey, stay with us, here.

39
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,667
I needed the money. That's all.

40
00:04:55,239 --> 00:04:58,787
- I didn't think anyone would die.
- Yeah, well, they did.

41
00:04:58,878 --> 00:05:01,631
You better get it together
if you wanna help yourself.

42
00:05:01,717 --> 00:05:05,312
Is Gaines the one watching us
through our surveillance?

43
00:05:05,397 --> 00:05:07,546
And you set that up?

44
00:05:09,716 --> 00:05:12,310
I can't do anything in here.
I have to get on the floor.

45
00:05:12,396 --> 00:05:17,344
We can't cut their video, cos Gaines'll get
suspicious when he sees you walkin' around.

46
00:05:17,435 --> 00:05:19,504
I know what to say to him.

47
00:05:22,634 --> 00:05:25,228
Did Jonathan get a shot off?
He hasn't checked in.

48
00:05:25,313 --> 00:05:29,511
Find him and tell him to get over here.
I need to know what happened.

49
00:05:32,072 --> 00:05:34,267
What the hell is goin' on?

50
00:05:38,631 --> 00:05:40,303
- Gaines.
- It's Jamey.

51
00:05:41,191 --> 00:05:43,625
- Why are you using a phone?
- It's OK, we're clear.

52
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:46,542
- I had to remove our tap.
- What the hell is happening?

53
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:49,905
You know that new engineer
they brought in - Milo Pressman?

54
00:05:49,989 --> 00:05:52,901
He was getting close to my entry
to the surveillance system.

55
00:05:52,989 --> 00:05:55,456
You said you could take care
of this for me, Jamey!

56
00:05:55,548 --> 00:06:00,382
And I did. I removed the tap. You don't need it
any more. I'm just trying to protect you.

57
00:06:00,867 --> 00:06:03,142
You wanna protect me? Get me Bauer!

58
00:06:03,227 --> 00:06:07,936
- They're taking him to Division.
- Division? Division? I gotta get him back.

59
00:06:08,026 --> 00:06:09,823
- And you will.
- When?

60
00:06:09,905 --> 00:06:13,181
I need him now, and if that's not
gonna happen, I will move on.

61
00:06:13,265 --> 00:06:18,213
Look, don't do anything until I call over there
and find out what's happening.

62
00:06:18,704 --> 00:06:20,615
All right. Get back to me.

63
00:06:23,463 --> 00:06:28,331
- He's not waiting around much longer.
- I'm going to work up the name Gaines.

64
00:06:37,461 --> 00:06:39,212
- Where have you been?
- I had to go out.

65
00:06:39,301 --> 00:06:41,814
There was some incident
this morning with Palmer.

66
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,494
We know. We're working on it.
What are you doing?

67
00:06:44,579 --> 00:06:46,855
Nothing. I'm waiting for
the key card from Tony.

68
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:50,215
Forget about that.
You're taking over all of Jamey's projects.

69
00:06:50,299 --> 00:06:53,051
- Why?
- Doesn't matter. She's no longer on the team.

70
00:06:53,138 --> 00:06:56,846
Fine, but if I'm gonna take over
an entire department, I want a bump in pay.

71
00:06:56,937 --> 00:06:59,497
Just do it, Milo. You'll be taken care of.

72
00:07:01,856 --> 00:07:06,407
It appears that someone may have had
a gun. Right now, Senator David Palmer...

73
00:07:06,496 --> 00:07:06,973
Bam!

74
00:07:07,495 --> 00:07:10,646
- That's all we have.
- Mark, call me the minute you find out.

75
00:07:10,735 --> 00:07:13,044
- I will.
- What did he say?

76
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:17,962
Just that they have someone in custody.
They don't know who.

77
00:07:18,054 --> 00:07:22,650
I don't know why you just didn't listen to
Secret Service the first time they told you.

78
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:24,928
Sherry, don't overreact.

79
00:07:25,013 --> 00:07:26,525
- Remember Annapolis?
- Yeah.

80
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:30,969
When they pulled me out of the auditorium?
But it turned out to be nothing.

81
00:07:31,051 --> 00:07:33,725
Yeah, well, that doesn't mean this is nothing.

82
00:07:33,811 --> 00:07:38,009
Oh, David, I really don't think
we should be takin' chances today.

83
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:42,487
I've been trackin' this assassin
since midnight! He was here.

84
00:07:42,569 --> 00:07:46,528
I know what he looks like. I can help you,
but you've gotta let me contact my people!

85
00:07:46,609 --> 00:07:48,361
- Sit down, Bauer!
- Back off!

86
00:07:48,449 --> 00:07:50,803
Alan, it's OK. I got it.

87
00:07:53,128 --> 00:07:55,801
You're not helpin' yourself here, Jack.

88
00:07:55,887 --> 00:07:59,084
- I need to get back in this case.
- That's not going to happen.

89
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:02,239
I have no choice
but to turn you over to the FBl.

90
00:08:06,926 --> 00:08:09,678
- Can I speak to you off the record?
- No.

91
00:08:09,765 --> 00:08:11,960
We can talk on the record.

92
00:08:19,603 --> 00:08:23,675
I know you're a good agent, Bauer. You want
to tell me what's really going on here?

93
00:08:23,762 --> 00:08:27,357
If you ever repeat what
I'm about to tell you, I will deny it.

94
00:08:27,442 --> 00:08:30,240
You'll understand as soon as I explain.

95
00:08:31,121 --> 00:08:36,911
My wife and daughter are being held hostage.
If I do not get out of this, they will be killed.

96
00:08:37,001 --> 00:08:39,798
- Who's holding them?
- The people that want Palmer dead.

97
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:44,031
They used me to smuggle a weapon
through security and give it to the assassin.

98
00:08:44,119 --> 00:08:45,711
Did you?

99
00:08:45,798 --> 00:08:48,596
- Yes.
- I'm not sure you want me to believe that.

100
00:08:48,678 --> 00:08:53,388
I had to. They were gonna kill my family. But
I got Palmer out of the room. I saved his life.

101
00:08:53,477 --> 00:08:57,709
This sounds crazy, but you've gotta believe
me. Phone my house, send a cruiser over.

102
00:08:57,797 --> 00:09:01,425
My family is gone, they have been taken.
You have to let me go.

103
00:09:01,516 --> 00:09:05,394
If I can get out there, I can be the conduit
to these people. I can bring them down.

104
00:09:05,475 --> 00:09:10,595
I don't have the authority to release you. I'm
gonna turn you over to District for a debrief.

105
00:09:10,674 --> 00:09:15,748
You tell 'em what you told me, maybe
they can help you out of your situation.

106
00:09:18,033 --> 00:09:21,503
- They won't.
- Alan, you and Mitchell take him down.

107
00:09:29,271 --> 00:09:32,343
- Sorry, Jack.
- You will be if Palmer dies.

108
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:39,701
I'll take him.

109
00:09:43,069 --> 00:09:45,060
Keep movin'.

110
00:09:49,468 --> 00:09:51,823
Don't move! Don't move!

111
00:09:54,507 --> 00:09:56,497
All right. Go ahead.

112
00:10:24,062 --> 00:10:27,292
- Hold it right there!
- Get down now!

113
00:10:29,341 --> 00:10:31,616
Stay down!

114
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:36,577
- Don't shoot! It'll explode!
- Do not fire.

115
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:40,129
We don't need an explosion in here.
Take it outside!

116
00:10:42,579 --> 00:10:44,170
Bauer!

117
00:10:48,537 --> 00:10:50,528
Get outta the way!

118
00:10:56,296 --> 00:10:59,288
Bauer's heading south. Do you copy?

119
00:11:03,775 --> 00:11:05,366
Bauer!

120
00:11:06,175 --> 00:11:07,766
Bauer!

121
00:11:15,453 --> 00:11:17,045
Bauer!

122
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:31,681
- Open the passenger door!
- Don't shoot!

123
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:35,239
Open the door! Don't panic.
I don't wanna hurt you.

124
00:11:39,369 --> 00:11:42,087
- There he is!
- Drive the car!

125
00:11:42,728 --> 00:11:44,286
Drive! Drive!

126
00:11:56,726 --> 00:11:58,716
Drive the car!

127
00:12:05,084 --> 00:12:07,882
- Turn left into this driveway now.
- OK.

128
00:12:18,922 --> 00:12:21,277
Make a right at the end of the parking lot.

129
00:12:21,362 --> 00:12:23,670
- Turn right! Turn right!
- OK! OK!

130
00:12:25,881 --> 00:12:27,473
Dammit!

131
00:12:28,761 --> 00:12:30,751
Back it up.

132
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:34,836
- No, no, no. Back up the other way.
- All right!

133
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,592
Go forward. Go into the construction site.

134
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:39,670
- Go, go, go!
- OK.

135
00:12:42,838 --> 00:12:44,988
Slow down. Let this truck pass.

136
00:12:50,356 --> 00:12:52,745
Turn in there. Through the gates.

137
00:12:54,876 --> 00:12:57,185
Parking spot on the left. Take it.

138
00:13:02,195 --> 00:13:05,709
Calm down. I just need to make
one phone call and then I'll let you go.

139
00:13:05,794 --> 00:13:08,102
Put the car in park.

140
00:13:09,673 --> 00:13:11,868
Now get out of the car.

141
00:13:19,752 --> 00:13:23,187
Please get out of the car. Get out of the car.

142
00:13:23,271 --> 00:13:25,261
Come on.

143
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:28,229
OK.

144
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:30,268
OK.

145
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:32,544
Get under the scaffolding.

146
00:13:41,828 --> 00:13:43,943
Up the stairs. Quick. Go.

147
00:13:44,028 --> 00:13:45,619
Go.

148
00:13:49,267 --> 00:13:51,655
- Open the door.
- It's locked.

149
00:13:55,546 --> 00:13:57,695
How could you do this?

150
00:13:58,225 --> 00:14:03,059
Betray your country. Be responsible
for the death of people you work with.

151
00:14:03,704 --> 00:14:06,092
I didn't know any of that
was going to happen.

152
00:14:06,183 --> 00:14:10,176
Oh, that's right. You just
tapped on the keyboard, right?

153
00:14:14,223 --> 00:14:16,611
So, how much they payin' you, huh?

154
00:14:17,622 --> 00:14:20,261
A million? Two million?

155
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:25,215
300,000.

156
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:32,089
I could use 300,000 bucks. Everybody
around here could use some extra cash.

157
00:14:32,179 --> 00:14:36,968
I had a husband who left me and my son
with nothing. I had to do something.

158
00:14:37,618 --> 00:14:40,131
- And this is what you did?
- Yeah, that's right.

159
00:14:40,218 --> 00:14:44,096
I work twice as hard as anyone here,
and I make half as much.

160
00:14:44,177 --> 00:14:47,772
- Do you think that's fair?
- You didn't have to take the job.

161
00:14:48,616 --> 00:14:51,733
You don't know
what kind of pressure I'm under.

162
00:14:51,815 --> 00:14:54,205
Oye, eres una vergüenza.

163
00:14:59,455 --> 00:15:03,446
Got Milo working on the name Gaines.
What else has she given you?

164
00:15:03,534 --> 00:15:06,332
- Excuses.
- Well, we gotta keep Gaines calm.

165
00:15:07,053 --> 00:15:09,930
Call him and say Jack's on his way
back to CTU from Division.

166
00:15:10,013 --> 00:15:15,040
- Keep him on the phone as long as you...
- I'm not saying anything until I get immunity.

167
00:15:15,131 --> 00:15:17,599
In writing, signed by Chapelle.

168
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:26,683
- Hello?
- Jack!

169
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:29,724
Thank God you're OK.
They wanted me to kill you.

170
00:15:29,809 --> 00:15:33,039
That's why I put the flak jacket on -
I couldn't think of anything else.

171
00:15:33,128 --> 00:15:36,677
- Why did they want you to kill me?
- You started piecing it together.

172
00:15:36,768 --> 00:15:39,964
- Nina, I am so sorry.
- No, it's OK. I'm fine.

173
00:15:40,048 --> 00:15:42,959
What's happening with Teri and Kim?

174
00:15:43,047 --> 00:15:47,881
They're being held hostage. They said they'd
kill them if I didn't help them take out Palmer.

175
00:15:47,966 --> 00:15:49,160
Where are you now?

176
00:15:49,246 --> 00:15:51,884
Secret Service had me in custody,
but I just got away.

177
00:15:51,965 --> 00:15:54,559
- Where are you?
- I'm back at CTU.

178
00:15:54,644 --> 00:15:56,715
They've tapped into our surveillance.

179
00:15:56,805 --> 00:16:00,194
Don't worry about it.
We found their inside person. It's Jamey.

180
00:16:00,284 --> 00:16:03,242
No, no, no, that's not possible.
Walsh cleared her.

181
00:16:03,323 --> 00:16:06,520
We've got her right here.
She's already confessed.

182
00:16:08,202 --> 00:16:10,194
Oh, my God.

183
00:16:13,122 --> 00:16:16,591
Oh, my God. She had access to everything.

184
00:16:19,841 --> 00:16:21,319
Did she mention Teri or Kim?

185
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:24,358
She just knows there was
someone named Gaines.

186
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,077
- What else?
- She's not cooperating.

187
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,592
What do you mean?

188
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:31,194
She wants a letter of immunity
from Chapelle before she says anything.

189
00:16:31,278 --> 00:16:32,631
- Is she there?
- Yeah.

190
00:16:32,719 --> 00:16:34,709
Put her on the phone.

191
00:16:35,517 --> 00:16:37,190
- Talk to him.
- No.

192
00:16:37,277 --> 00:16:38,995
Jamey.

193
00:16:40,077 --> 00:16:42,068
- She's listenin'.
- Jamey?

194
00:16:44,397 --> 00:16:45,147
Yeah?

195
00:16:45,236 --> 00:16:50,673
I know that Nina and Tony don't understand
what you're going through, but you know me.

196
00:16:50,755 --> 00:16:53,553
I don't care about protocol
and I am true to my word.

197
00:16:53,634 --> 00:16:57,627
If you help me bring down Gaines and
help get my wife and daughter back safely,

198
00:16:57,714 --> 00:17:00,466
I promise you I will get you out of this.

199
00:17:00,554 --> 00:17:03,306
- You don't have the power to do that.
- Of course I do.

200
00:17:03,393 --> 00:17:07,351
Right now only four of us know about this.
I can take care of Nina and Tony.

201
00:17:07,433 --> 00:17:09,787
I can get this done. Jamey, please.

202
00:17:09,872 --> 00:17:13,500
No. You'll say anything.
I want the immunity first.

203
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:21,579
What do you want me to do, Jack?

204
00:17:24,909 --> 00:17:27,104
She has a son named Kyle.

205
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:31,301
- Bring him in.
- Wait a minute, Jack. You can't do that.

206
00:17:31,388 --> 00:17:34,299
- You gotta be careful.
- I also need a car.

207
00:17:34,388 --> 00:17:39,017
Put a CTU com unit in it, box of 9mm ammo,
a locksmith kit, the whole package.

208
00:17:39,107 --> 00:17:41,985
- And then?
- I'll try and get out of this situation.

209
00:17:42,066 --> 00:17:45,661
- I'm gonna go find Teri and Kim.
- Where do you want the car?

210
00:17:46,786 --> 00:17:49,174
Corner of Temple and Mercer.

211
00:17:49,265 --> 00:17:50,744
OK.

212
00:17:51,265 --> 00:17:53,460
- Thank you.
- Bye.

213
00:17:59,824 --> 00:18:02,212
Who are you? What's goin' on?

214
00:18:03,383 --> 00:18:06,977
A few hours ago someone
kidnapped my wife and daughter.

215
00:18:07,542 --> 00:18:11,500
I don't get it. Then why are you
runnin' from the police?

216
00:18:11,581 --> 00:18:13,731
What's your name? Lauren?

217
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:21,529
I'm Jack. I work for
a special branch of the government.

218
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:25,055
Last night I was given
a very important assignment.

219
00:18:25,139 --> 00:18:28,529
Right now someone is trying
to stop me from doing it.

220
00:18:33,777 --> 00:18:36,086
You don't believe me, do you?

221
00:18:38,696 --> 00:18:41,972
If I were you, I wouldn't believe me either.

222
00:18:42,056 --> 00:18:46,971
What I wanna know is, why do you have me
here? You got a car, you got a place to hide.

223
00:18:47,055 --> 00:18:49,614
I can't afford to be taken back into custody.

224
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:55,086
If they get close enough, I have to make them
believe I'm willing to do something crazy.

225
00:18:55,653 --> 00:18:57,644
Like shoot me?

226
00:19:01,012 --> 00:19:03,207
I'm not gonna shoot you.

227
00:19:08,411 --> 00:19:10,402
You know somethin'?

228
00:19:11,051 --> 00:19:13,246
I think I believe you.

229
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:17,887
- What are you doing?
- You're not the only one who has problems.

230
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:20,404
I just came off of a hellacious night shift,

231
00:19:20,489 --> 00:19:25,562
I'm due in court in 45 minutes
on a DUl charge, of which I'm guilty,

232
00:19:25,649 --> 00:19:28,845
so, you know,
good luck with your crisis, OK?

233
00:19:29,687 --> 00:19:31,120
Don't!

234
00:19:31,808 --> 00:19:35,845
Lauren, I have killed
two people since midnight.

235
00:19:35,927 --> 00:19:38,077
I have not slept for over 24 hours.

236
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:43,478
So maybe... maybe you should be a little
more afraid of me than you are right now.

237
00:19:46,085 --> 00:19:47,881
Sit.

238
00:20:04,482 --> 00:20:07,393
- Are you OK?
- Oh, no need to worry.

239
00:20:07,482 --> 00:20:12,350
- We heard there was someone with a gun.
- Um, it's not clear what happened.

240
00:20:12,441 --> 00:20:17,467
And I'm afraid I'm intact and as grouchy
as ever. So let's all get back to work.

241
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:21,592
- Where's Keith?
- He left about a half-hour ago.

242
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,590
- Did he say where?
- No.

243
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,590
- Look, I'm a little worried about him.
- Why?

244
00:20:26,678 --> 00:20:30,147
He wasn't being himself.
He stormed out of here like he was angry.

245
00:20:30,238 --> 00:20:33,229
- I'm sure he'll be all right, Anna. Thanks.
- OK.

246
00:20:35,516 --> 00:20:38,349
Should we... send someone after him?

247
00:20:38,436 --> 00:20:42,429
No. No, he's OK.
He just needs some time alone.

248
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:50,104
I'll call Secret Service.

249
00:20:50,634 --> 00:20:52,908
David.

250
00:20:52,994 --> 00:20:58,465
I know how you feel about telling our side
of the story first, but there is no time for that.

251
00:20:58,552 --> 00:21:04,070
Maureen is gonna go on air at nine o'clock.
That's 40 minutes from right now.

252
00:21:04,151 --> 00:21:07,143
Isn't there anything we can do to stop her?

253
00:21:07,231 --> 00:21:09,346
She won't budge.

254
00:21:09,871 --> 00:21:11,781
And why would she?

255
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:17,227
"Candidate's son faces murder charges.
Cover-up suspected. " It's a huge story.

256
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:21,779
I cannot believe that you are just going to
accept this without puttin' up a fight.

257
00:21:21,868 --> 00:21:26,305
There's nothing to fight. It doesn't matter
who breaks the story, me or Maureen.

258
00:21:26,387 --> 00:21:30,505
- We have to deal with it and get past it.
- You've done the impossible for your career.

259
00:21:30,587 --> 00:21:33,658
- I'm just asking you to do it for your son.
- No.

260
00:21:34,307 --> 00:21:37,104
You're asking me to rewrite history.

261
00:21:37,186 --> 00:21:40,939
And if you wanted my help, you would've
asked me for it seven years ago.

262
00:21:41,026 --> 00:21:43,493
Oh, for crying out loud, David!

263
00:21:46,264 --> 00:21:49,859
- I need today's schedule in my office.
- Yes, sir, right away.

264
00:21:55,302 --> 00:21:57,294
- Almeida.
- It's Jack. Where's Nina?

265
00:21:57,382 --> 00:22:00,374
She's workin' up some information
we got from Jamey.

266
00:22:00,462 --> 00:22:02,338
- Is Kyle there yet?
- No, not yet.

267
00:22:02,422 --> 00:22:06,130
- What about the car?
- Nina sent it. Should be there... ten minutes.

268
00:22:06,221 --> 00:22:09,769
- Good. Anything else from Jamey?
- Nothing useful, no.

269
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:14,933
Tony, Secret Service told me that you were
the one who told 'em to take me outta play.

270
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:17,533
Yeah. I felt I had to, Jack.

271
00:22:17,619 --> 00:22:20,928
Given the information you had,
I think you made the right choice.

272
00:22:21,018 --> 00:22:26,138
I didn't realise what you were goin' through.
You didn't need me givin' you attitude.

273
00:22:26,217 --> 00:22:30,528
Yeah, well, I appreciate that. Look,
I wish I knew earlier who I could trust.

274
00:22:30,617 --> 00:22:33,813
I'm just glad you were there
when Nina came back to CTU.

275
00:22:33,896 --> 00:22:35,409
Yeah.

276
00:22:36,495 --> 00:22:39,293
- I'll call you as soon as I get to the car.
- All right.

277
00:22:39,375 --> 00:22:40,569
Bye.

278
00:22:40,655 --> 00:22:43,293
Hey, Lauren. Come here, to the window.

279
00:22:47,654 --> 00:22:50,292
See that tool there,
looks like a hedge trimmer?

280
00:22:50,373 --> 00:22:52,284
What, the bolt cutters?

281
00:22:52,373 --> 00:22:55,843
Yes, the bolt cutters.
Could you get them for me, please?

282
00:22:58,052 --> 00:23:00,770
Hey. Hey. I'll be watching you.

283
00:23:41,165 --> 00:23:42,802
Good.

284
00:23:42,884 --> 00:23:45,351
Do it with a burst. Give it everything you got.

285
00:23:45,443 --> 00:23:47,638
I know how to use bolt cutters.

286
00:23:51,803 --> 00:23:53,394
Good.

287
00:24:00,721 --> 00:24:04,713
That was Frank Simes from
the Secret Service. What are you doin'?

288
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:09,351
- Pouring myself a drink, Mike.
- It's not even nine in the morning.

289
00:24:09,439 --> 00:24:13,034
- What did Simes say?
- The CTU agent who created the disturbance

290
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:15,757
at the power plant was named Jack Bauer.

291
00:24:16,558 --> 00:24:19,675
He tried to take the gun off
one of the Secret Service agents,

292
00:24:19,758 --> 00:24:22,908
but claimed the gesture was misinterpreted.

293
00:24:22,997 --> 00:24:25,192
- Maybe it was.
- Yeah, well...

294
00:24:25,277 --> 00:24:29,030
As Bauer was being taken
into custody, he escaped.

295
00:24:29,116 --> 00:24:31,949
- How the hell did he do that?
- I don't know.

296
00:24:32,036 --> 00:24:35,152
But they haven't found him yet.
He's still out there.

297
00:24:35,875 --> 00:24:37,830
Jack Bauer. Jack Bauer.

298
00:24:38,274 --> 00:24:40,265
You know him?

299
00:24:40,354 --> 00:24:42,151
I've heard the name.

300
00:24:57,552 --> 00:24:59,223
Get up.

301
00:24:59,871 --> 00:25:03,704
- What are you doing?
- Don't worry. I'm not gonna hurt her.

302
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:08,864
- Get up and go in the other room.
- Don't even think about touching her.

303
00:25:08,949 --> 00:25:10,746
Move it!

304
00:25:10,829 --> 00:25:12,706
- No.
- Don't touch her!

305
00:25:12,788 --> 00:25:15,666
You stay outta this or I will hurt her.
Come on.

306
00:25:25,026 --> 00:25:27,494
No! Get away! No! Get away!

307
00:25:27,587 --> 00:25:28,905
Shut up!

308
00:25:29,466 --> 00:25:31,457
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

309
00:25:32,506 --> 00:25:34,496
I won't fight you.

310
00:25:42,023 --> 00:25:44,617
- Mom?
- It's gonna be all right, honey.

311
00:25:49,223 --> 00:25:51,338
Come on.

312
00:25:52,861 --> 00:25:54,852
- Come on.
- All right.

313
00:25:55,981 --> 00:25:58,051
- Fine.
- OK.

314
00:26:16,258 --> 00:26:17,850
Mom!

315
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:03,998
- Maureen Kingsley.
- Thanks.

316
00:27:07,609 --> 00:27:13,001
- Maureen, hi. Thanks for getting back to me.
- I'm about to go on air, Sherry. What's up?

317
00:27:13,088 --> 00:27:15,556
- Don't go with the story.
- Excuse me?

318
00:27:15,648 --> 00:27:18,684
The story about Keith.
Just leave it alone for right now.

319
00:27:18,767 --> 00:27:21,156
The s... Hold on, please.

320
00:27:21,247 --> 00:27:23,635
Can you give me one minute? Thanks.

321
00:27:28,526 --> 00:27:32,358
The story about Keith is exclusive
and it's documented.

322
00:27:32,444 --> 00:27:34,753
I'm not making false allegations about him.

323
00:27:34,845 --> 00:27:39,473
There was an assassination attempt
this morning on my husband,

324
00:27:39,563 --> 00:27:41,713
but it's being covered up.

325
00:27:43,323 --> 00:27:44,676
Go on.

326
00:27:44,762 --> 00:27:47,595
The man they arrested
works for the government,

327
00:27:47,682 --> 00:27:50,276
and he may not have been acting alone.

328
00:27:51,761 --> 00:27:56,231
Are you telling me that there's a conspiracy
inside the government to kill your husband?

329
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,471
I am telling you something's going on
that hasn't been reported.

330
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:02,120
And if you give me a couple of hours...

331
00:28:02,999 --> 00:28:05,194
I'll milk some of my sources.

332
00:28:06,479 --> 00:28:09,311
OK, look, I won't kill the story about Keith.

333
00:28:09,399 --> 00:28:14,108
I'm not asking you to.
Just... hold off on it for a couple of days.

334
00:28:24,716 --> 00:28:26,034
Mom.

335
00:28:26,116 --> 00:28:30,188
- I'm sorry. This is all my fault.
- No, no, no. It's OK, honey. It's OK. Shh.

336
00:28:30,274 --> 00:28:33,027
If I hadn't snuck out,
this wouldn't have happened.

337
00:28:33,114 --> 00:28:34,466
Listen to me.

338
00:28:35,554 --> 00:28:39,466
We are going to get through this.
We're gonna be a family again.

339
00:28:39,953 --> 00:28:42,864
You and me and Dad
are gonna have our lives back.

340
00:28:47,112 --> 00:28:51,707
This is not gonna be a part of that life.
You understand what I'm saying?

341
00:28:53,469 --> 00:28:55,664
You're not gonna tell Dad?

342
00:29:00,188 --> 00:29:02,827
Where did you get that?

343
00:29:06,028 --> 00:29:08,222
- CTU. Myers.
- Nina, listen, it's Teri.

344
00:29:08,307 --> 00:29:10,502
Teri, where are you?

345
00:29:12,386 --> 00:29:14,536
Hello? Hello? Teri?

346
00:29:16,065 --> 00:29:18,057
Hello? Teri?

347
00:29:18,585 --> 00:29:21,418
The number's blocked.

348
00:29:22,824 --> 00:29:24,974
Stand in that corner.

349
00:30:12,136 --> 00:30:14,330
No, I don't wanna go on with the governor.

350
00:30:14,416 --> 00:30:17,373
Put him on first. If he's got a problem,
have him talk to Mike.

351
00:30:17,455 --> 00:30:21,049
- It'll look like he's introducing you.
- Good. I want it to look that way.

352
00:30:21,134 --> 00:30:23,523
- OK.
- Dave, I'll talk to you later.

353
00:30:28,054 --> 00:30:30,613
- Where'd you go?
- Oh, I just went out.

354
00:30:30,693 --> 00:30:33,253
- Are you OK?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

355
00:30:34,732 --> 00:30:37,804
Um... you didn't tell the press about me.

356
00:30:39,132 --> 00:30:41,201
It's gonna come out soon, anyway.

357
00:30:41,291 --> 00:30:45,761
Look, I've talked to my lawyer,
and he's got his best people workin' on it.

358
00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:49,160
- His best people. Right.
- Look, Keith, don't be this way.

359
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:54,277
You're gonna be cleared. You're gonna get on
with your life without it hangin' over you.

360
00:30:55,569 --> 00:30:57,286
Sure.

361
00:30:57,368 --> 00:30:59,598
You ready to go?

362
00:30:59,688 --> 00:31:02,804
Kingsley's gonna break the story.
Have we prepared something?

363
00:31:02,888 --> 00:31:04,798
No longer necessary.

364
00:31:04,887 --> 00:31:07,002
- What?
- I just got off the phone with her.

365
00:31:07,087 --> 00:31:09,680
She's gonna sit on the story for now.

366
00:31:11,326 --> 00:31:15,319
- Why would she do that?
- I don't know. Maybe you got through to her.

367
00:31:15,405 --> 00:31:17,999
No, I didn't. It's something else.

368
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:22,323
Ready?

369
00:31:22,404 --> 00:31:25,999
Maureen Kingsley decided to
hold off on the story for some reason.

370
00:31:26,083 --> 00:31:29,711
- Thank God, David.
- You have any idea why she'd do that?

371
00:31:29,802 --> 00:31:34,511
No. Maybe her sources weren't
as solid as she said they were.

372
00:31:37,321 --> 00:31:39,709
What? Aren't you relieved?

373
00:31:40,321 --> 00:31:43,996
- I wanna talk to her.
- After she gets off the air, we'll call her.

374
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,469
Don't you think it's smarter to let things be?

375
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:50,837
- It's smarter to know everybody's motives.
- Come on, let's go.

376
00:31:50,919 --> 00:31:52,909
Come on.

377
00:32:06,436 --> 00:32:10,145
- Where do you work?
- Cable's coffee shop on Ventura.

378
00:32:10,235 --> 00:32:13,625
Home of the 3.99 all-day breakfast.

379
00:32:15,435 --> 00:32:17,312
You married?

380
00:32:17,394 --> 00:32:23,389
I used to be. But my sister moved in with us
after she got into a really bad car accident.

381
00:32:23,473 --> 00:32:28,501
She couldn't take care of herself, and my...
my husband Henry told me I had to choose.

382
00:32:28,593 --> 00:32:31,629
- You chose your sister?
- Yep.

383
00:32:32,912 --> 00:32:36,028
- Is this your first DUl?
- First in a couple of years.

384
00:32:37,591 --> 00:32:40,788
- You got a problem?
- What, a drinking problem?

385
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:46,147
I wish it were that simple.
At least then I'd have a support group.

386
00:32:47,909 --> 00:32:51,185
Nope, what I'm afraid I have is bad luck.

387
00:32:54,588 --> 00:32:57,386
Sorry I had to get you involved in all this.

388
00:32:57,948 --> 00:33:00,222
Just let me go.

389
00:33:01,067 --> 00:33:03,262
As soon as I get my car.

390
00:33:06,146 --> 00:33:08,340
As soon as I get my car.

391
00:33:10,945 --> 00:33:13,505
I used to be in the military.

392
00:33:13,585 --> 00:33:15,815
Used to do field work for the CIA.

393
00:33:17,304 --> 00:33:20,102
I've been to some horrible places.

394
00:33:20,944 --> 00:33:23,537
I've seen some pretty terrible things.

395
00:33:25,623 --> 00:33:29,410
I don't think I've ever been
this scared in my whole life.

396
00:34:31,612 --> 00:34:35,604
No, I told you I'm not saying
any more until I get counsel.

397
00:34:35,691 --> 00:34:38,330
- I think you will.
- Why do you think that?

398
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:41,519
Cos we're bringing Kyle here.

399
00:34:42,089 --> 00:34:43,318
What?

400
00:34:45,449 --> 00:34:50,238
- I'll kill you if you touch my son.
- We're not gonna lay a finger on him.

401
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:55,205
But if you don't help us find Gaines, we don't
have a choice but to bring him in here.

402
00:34:55,287 --> 00:34:57,278
No, you won't.

403
00:34:58,526 --> 00:35:00,517
- No.
- We will, Jamey.

404
00:35:02,126 --> 00:35:06,517
Imagine the effect it'll have on him,
seeing his mother in restraints.

405
00:35:07,485 --> 00:35:11,034
- Arrested for being a traitor.
- No. This is not fair.

406
00:35:11,645 --> 00:35:15,875
That's a picture he's gonna
carry with him the rest of his life.

407
00:35:18,843 --> 00:35:20,435
Nina...

408
00:35:21,443 --> 00:35:23,034
Please.

409
00:35:24,282 --> 00:35:27,159
Don't do this.
Kyle can't see me like this. Please, Nina.

410
00:35:27,242 --> 00:35:30,677
He doesn't have to.
You just have to start talking to us.

411
00:35:30,761 --> 00:35:33,400
The bottom line is, Jamey,

412
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:37,438
the best thing you can do for your son
is to help us get Gaines now.

413
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,158
Why?

414
00:35:39,239 --> 00:35:45,075
Once we have you in custody, Gaines will do
anything he can to keep you from testifying.

415
00:35:45,158 --> 00:35:48,787
And if he can't get to you directly,
where's he going next?

416
00:35:48,878 --> 00:35:50,868
Your son, right?

417
00:35:54,038 --> 00:35:55,629
Kyle...

418
00:36:15,873 --> 00:36:17,864
I'm just...

419
00:36:19,473 --> 00:36:21,463
confused.

420
00:36:22,032 --> 00:36:24,182
I need time to think.

421
00:36:26,551 --> 00:36:28,940
Take a couple of minutes.

422
00:36:48,708 --> 00:36:51,585
Lauren, I'm in big trouble.
I need your help, please.

423
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:55,341
I've gotta get to a car, but if I step outside,
they'll take me into custody.

424
00:36:55,427 --> 00:36:57,701
- And you want me to pick it up?
- Yes.

425
00:36:57,786 --> 00:37:02,336
- Bring it back here. Park it round the side.
- Why didn't your friend drop it off here?

426
00:37:02,425 --> 00:37:06,941
The person dropping it off was just following
orders. He couldn't know it was for me.

427
00:37:07,024 --> 00:37:09,663
Aw! Do you realise how insane this sounds?

428
00:37:09,744 --> 00:37:11,734
Yes, I do.

429
00:37:20,342 --> 00:37:24,414
OK, let's just say for the sake
of argument I believe half of it.

430
00:37:24,502 --> 00:37:29,256
Just tell me one thing. Is your wife
and daughter really in trouble?

431
00:37:29,341 --> 00:37:31,332
Yes, they are.

432
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:39,730
- All right. Where's the car?
- Over on the corner of Temple and Mercer.

433
00:37:39,819 --> 00:37:43,811
It's a silver sedan, government plates.
The keys'll be in it.

434
00:38:12,814 --> 00:38:15,690
Keep going, Lauren. Keep going. Come on.

435
00:38:21,452 --> 00:38:22,850
No.

436
00:38:23,372 --> 00:38:24,963
No.

437
00:38:26,651 --> 00:38:29,323
- Hey! Hey! Excuse me!
- No!

438
00:38:29,411 --> 00:38:31,002
Dammit!

439
00:38:45,367 --> 00:38:48,086
Jack! He's out the window! I see him!

440
00:38:48,927 --> 00:38:51,725
All right, this is Hayes. I got a 20 on Bauer.

441
00:39:21,642 --> 00:39:25,270
- So, what have you got?
- I tried "Gaines" under various spellings.

442
00:39:25,361 --> 00:39:29,956
I came up with a long list of those with
records and those with criminal associations.

443
00:39:30,039 --> 00:39:35,397
Crosscheck it with everything else we got
tonight. Plane crash, Alan York, Penticoff.

444
00:39:35,479 --> 00:39:37,515
Got it.

445
00:39:37,598 --> 00:39:40,795
- She's had enough time to think about it.
- Yeah.

446
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:48,636
Jamey's son Kyle's gonna be brought in.
Call me in ITS when he gets here.

447
00:39:48,716 --> 00:39:52,994
- Wait. What kinda trouble is she in?
- No trouble.

448
00:39:53,075 --> 00:39:56,431
Don't treat me like I'm stupid.
You tell me to take over her stuff,

449
00:39:56,515 --> 00:39:59,666
you and Tony are gone for an hour,
now you're bringing her son in?

450
00:39:59,755 --> 00:40:03,906
- She's in trouble. I wanna know what's...
- You're not an internal affairs agent.

451
00:40:03,994 --> 00:40:06,905
Keep quiet. Call us when Kyle gets here, OK?

452
00:40:08,233 --> 00:40:11,908
- He's gonna figure it out.
- It won't be a secret much longer anyway.

453
00:40:11,993 --> 00:40:16,668
But we need to bring Milo in. Whatever
Jamey gives us, he'll be the one to work it up.

454
00:40:16,752 --> 00:40:19,744
- I hope it's somethin' substantial.
- Yeah.

455
00:40:21,111 --> 00:40:23,022
Oh, my God.

456
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:25,101
- Get her out of those!
- Jamey?

457
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:27,181
What's the number?

458
00:40:29,029 --> 00:40:34,149
- Hang in there. Come on. Come on, now.
- We need medical help. We're in ITS.

459
00:40:34,228 --> 00:40:36,264
Hurry!

460
00:40:36,348 --> 00:40:38,339
Grab her legs.

461
00:40:39,588 --> 00:40:42,579
Watch her head. Jamey, what have you done?

462
00:40:47,426 --> 00:40:50,657
- What?
- It's Milo. Should I bring Jamey's son in?

463
00:40:50,746 --> 00:40:52,941
No! Keep him out of here.

464
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:27,291
It's Gaines.
