1
00:00:13,053 --> 00:00:18,366
Right now, terrorists are plotting
to assassinate a presidential candidate.

2
00:00:18,453 --> 00:00:20,842
My wife and daughter have been targeted.

3
00:00:20,933 --> 00:00:24,926
And people that I work with
may be involved in both.

4
00:00:25,013 --> 00:00:30,326
I'm Federal Agent Jack Bauer,
and today is the longest day of my life.

5
00:00:34,133 --> 00:00:36,203
I'll be framed for Ferragamo's murder?

6
00:00:36,293 --> 00:00:41,162
What we've got is a tape of Carl Webb
admitting that he set my son up for murder.

7
00:00:41,253 --> 00:00:44,370
- I destroyed it.
- That wasn't the real tape.

8
00:00:45,893 --> 00:00:47,531
Set up a press conference.

9
00:00:47,613 --> 00:00:49,285
- When?
- Now.

10
00:00:49,373 --> 00:00:52,809
- Still no sign of the women?
- I'll find them and kill them.

11
00:00:52,893 --> 00:00:56,602
- Just tell me how you plan to find them.
- I'm going to the Bauer house.

12
00:00:56,693 --> 00:00:58,649
- I don't know you.
- My name's Kim.

13
00:00:58,733 --> 00:01:02,408
- How do you know Rick?
- She's a friend of mine. She's gotta get home.

14
00:01:02,493 --> 00:01:07,442
She's not going anywhere. Till Dan
gets back with the money, nobody leaves.

15
00:01:07,773 --> 00:01:10,333
- Jack, where are you?
- We're on our way to a meet.

16
00:01:10,413 --> 00:01:14,042
- What kind of meet?
- Alexis was supposed to make a payoff.

17
00:01:14,133 --> 00:01:15,407
I think I got him.

18
00:01:15,493 --> 00:01:17,882
- Hey.
- Where's the money?

19
00:01:17,973 --> 00:01:19,884
First let's go over it again.

20
00:01:19,973 --> 00:01:23,568
At 7.20 tonight I'm gonna shut down
the power on grid 26 double G.

21
00:01:23,653 --> 00:01:25,928
- What else?
- What happened to your accent?

22
00:01:26,013 --> 00:01:27,810
- You're not Alexis.
- He's moving.

23
00:01:27,893 --> 00:01:30,123
- I can take him.
- No!

24
00:01:31,373 --> 00:01:34,046
Get me a medic down here now!

25
00:01:34,413 --> 00:01:38,247
- Who are you?
- A good friend who wanted to be a lot more.

26
00:01:38,333 --> 00:01:43,566
- I don't remember any of this.
- I think you have dissociative amnesia.

27
00:01:43,653 --> 00:01:48,044
- We need to get you checked out.
- No. Please, Phil, just take me home.

28
00:02:11,813 --> 00:02:17,365
The first time you invited me back here, you
left your keys in my car. It was pouring rain.

29
00:02:17,453 --> 00:02:19,921
We didn't wanna run back, so...

30
00:02:21,013 --> 00:02:23,607
we used your Hide-A-Key.

31
00:02:44,413 --> 00:02:48,326
What do I do? I don't know what to do.
I don't know what the code is.

32
00:02:48,413 --> 00:02:51,405
Just take your time. Maybe it'll come to you.

33
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:55,570
Just make this stop!

34
00:03:09,493 --> 00:03:11,688
- Hello?
- This is Superior Alarms.

35
00:03:11,773 --> 00:03:14,526
- Could you turn this off?
- I'll need your password.

36
00:03:14,613 --> 00:03:18,367
- What?
- Ma'am, what is your password?

37
00:03:18,453 --> 00:03:21,923
- I don't know the password.
- Are you having an emergency there?

38
00:03:23,213 --> 00:03:25,647
Alan Morgan... Saugus.

39
00:03:25,733 --> 00:03:29,726
- Yeah. Pacific Electric.
- Got it. All right. Thanks.

40
00:03:31,693 --> 00:03:36,403
Jack? His name was Alan Morgan.
He worked for Pacific Electric in Saugus.

41
00:03:36,493 --> 00:03:40,725
Saugus? OK, he was paid off by Alexis
to kill the power in a section of the grid.

42
00:03:40,813 --> 00:03:43,407
- Did you get the coordinates? 26...
- Double G. Yeah.

43
00:03:43,493 --> 00:03:47,042
- We need to know where that is.
- I'll get this to Tony. Shall I stick around?

44
00:03:47,133 --> 00:03:50,523
- No. Just get hold of me if you get anything.
- OK. See you at the office.

45
00:03:50,613 --> 00:03:52,604
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

46
00:03:53,573 --> 00:03:56,371
None of these are working.

47
00:03:56,453 --> 00:03:59,206
Superior Alarms! Stay where you are!

48
00:03:59,293 --> 00:04:02,365
Please. This woman, she lives here.

49
00:04:02,453 --> 00:04:05,013
She just forgot her code.

50
00:04:21,213 --> 00:04:22,851
Thank you.

51
00:04:22,933 --> 00:04:24,366
- Teri Bauer?
- Yes.

52
00:04:24,453 --> 00:04:26,648
- Do you have any ID?
- Um...

53
00:04:28,133 --> 00:04:31,330
Sure. It's probably in my purse. I'll go check.

54
00:04:55,093 --> 00:04:58,085
No ID necessary. You obviously live here.

55
00:04:59,653 --> 00:05:02,213
She just couldn't remember her code.

56
00:05:02,293 --> 00:05:05,285
I don't usually set it. My daughter must have.

57
00:05:05,373 --> 00:05:07,841
It's all right. Just sign this.

58
00:05:13,173 --> 00:05:17,610
OK. I'm gonna reset the alarm and check
the contacts around the outside of the house.

59
00:05:17,693 --> 00:05:20,002
That should take about 15 minutes.

60
00:05:20,093 --> 00:05:22,084
Thank you.

61
00:05:24,373 --> 00:05:26,364
Thank you.

62
00:05:55,493 --> 00:05:58,769
Nice, Jack. There's always
a body count everywhere you go.

63
00:05:58,853 --> 00:06:02,482
- I gave Hanlin clear orders not to shoot.
- Where'd he go?

64
00:06:02,573 --> 00:06:04,962
He's over there.

65
00:06:06,573 --> 00:06:08,484
- Bauer.
- Jack, it's David Palmer.

66
00:06:08,573 --> 00:06:12,486
- Yes, Senator?
- I just heard from my source at the Pentagon.

67
00:06:12,573 --> 00:06:15,326
I had to twist a lot of arms
to get the missing Drazen file.

68
00:06:15,413 --> 00:06:17,688
- What was in it?
- Dates and locations.

69
00:06:17,773 --> 00:06:21,527
It seems to relate to the last months
of Victor Drazen's life.

70
00:06:21,613 --> 00:06:24,446
- Anything we can use?
- Maybe.

71
00:06:24,533 --> 00:06:28,970
The last entry is an address
unrelated to everything else.

72
00:06:29,053 --> 00:06:33,649
- What is it?
- 21911 Kipling, in a city called Saugus.

73
00:06:33,733 --> 00:06:36,930
- I don't know where that is.
- Senator, did you just say Saugus?

74
00:06:37,013 --> 00:06:39,811
- Does that mean anything?
- Yes. I'll get back to you.

75
00:06:39,893 --> 00:06:43,044
- Thank you, Senator. This is going to help.
- All right.

76
00:06:49,053 --> 00:06:52,045
- CTU. Almeida.
- Tony, it's Jack. Take down this address.

77
00:06:52,133 --> 00:06:57,127
- Go ahead.
- 21911 Kipling Avenue, in Saugus.

78
00:06:57,213 --> 00:07:00,091
I got a feeling it's in
the grid coordinates Nina gave you.

79
00:07:00,173 --> 00:07:02,368
All right. Hang on.

80
00:07:09,213 --> 00:07:13,126
Yeah, you're right.
It's right in the middle of sector 26-GG.

81
00:07:13,213 --> 00:07:16,922
- OK. Find out what's there. Get back to me.
- All right.

82
00:07:18,213 --> 00:07:20,852
Hey. Where are you headed?

83
00:07:20,933 --> 00:07:25,085
Saugus. Alexis paid this guy off to knock
the power out at a specific address there.

84
00:07:25,173 --> 00:07:29,166
- I wanna know why.
- Slow down. I'm on your side. Fill me in.

85
00:07:31,693 --> 00:07:37,370
Two and a half hours ago Robert Ellis was
killed because he almost found this location.

86
00:07:37,453 --> 00:07:41,731
We got the address from the Drazen file.
The senator just gave it to me.

87
00:07:41,813 --> 00:07:44,646
- OK. Let's go.
- What do you mean "let's"?

88
00:07:44,733 --> 00:07:47,805
You wanna go, I'm your chaperone.
You want a ride?

89
00:07:54,053 --> 00:07:55,771
Yeah.

90
00:07:55,853 --> 00:07:57,844
Hop in.

91
00:08:06,093 --> 00:08:09,529
Where's my brother?
These guys are gonna be here in 20 minutes.

92
00:08:09,613 --> 00:08:15,051
I told you, we split up. He said he was gonna
meet me here with the payoff from Gaines.

93
00:08:15,133 --> 00:08:18,489
Look, if I was ripping you off,
why would I come back here?

94
00:08:18,573 --> 00:08:20,689
Damn!

95
00:08:20,773 --> 00:08:23,845
- Where are you going?
- Don't worry about it.

96
00:08:23,933 --> 00:08:26,322
- What you doing?
- I'm not waiting here to get killed.

97
00:08:26,413 --> 00:08:29,291
You're not going.
She'll tell the police about the deal.

98
00:08:29,373 --> 00:08:33,048
I don't care about the deal! I came here
cos I wanted you to help find my mom.

99
00:08:33,133 --> 00:08:35,408
- That was a dumb idea.
- You came for Rick.

100
00:08:35,493 --> 00:08:37,848
- I did not!
- Don't worry about her. Just leave.

101
00:08:37,933 --> 00:08:40,208
What do you mean "Don't worry about me"?

102
00:08:40,293 --> 00:08:41,851
- Come with me.
- I can't.

103
00:08:41,933 --> 00:08:44,049
Whatever's out there is better than in here.

104
00:08:44,133 --> 00:08:46,852
You heard Frank.
Nobody leaves until Dan gets back.

105
00:08:46,933 --> 00:08:49,527
Dan is not coming back!

106
00:08:50,533 --> 00:08:53,001
What do you mean?

107
00:08:56,013 --> 00:08:59,085
- I don't know. I just... I don't...
- What do you mean?!

108
00:08:59,173 --> 00:09:01,767
- Leave her alone.
- Where is he?

109
00:09:04,253 --> 00:09:08,166
- He's dead.
- What are you talking about?

110
00:09:08,253 --> 00:09:13,122
Gaines killed him. He was gonna kill me too.
I swear to God. Gaines was out of control.

111
00:09:36,213 --> 00:09:38,329
So who's got the money now?

112
00:09:38,413 --> 00:09:41,530
Nobody. Gaines never paid us.

113
00:09:48,973 --> 00:09:52,010
These guys are gonna be here in half an hour.

114
00:09:52,093 --> 00:09:54,846
These are not the kind of guys
you come up short with.

115
00:09:54,933 --> 00:09:57,606
- Then call it off.
- Too late to call it off!

116
00:10:37,693 --> 00:10:41,163
What are you gonna say
down there today, David?

117
00:10:44,293 --> 00:10:46,568
- He's gonna tell the truth.
- Don't start.

118
00:10:46,653 --> 00:10:49,008
- You've caused enough pain in this family.
- Sherry!

119
00:10:49,093 --> 00:10:52,483
Well, I'm sorry, David,
but somebody's got to say the words.

120
00:10:52,573 --> 00:10:57,772
This thing wouldn't have started if Keith
hadn't taken matters into his own hands.

121
00:10:58,853 --> 00:11:01,572
Listen to me.

122
00:11:01,653 --> 00:11:04,884
Nobody's defending what Keith did.

123
00:11:04,973 --> 00:11:07,612
He acted on the moment. It wasn't right.

124
00:11:07,693 --> 00:11:12,767
That doesn't make you right for covering
it up, or make me right for not being there.

125
00:11:12,853 --> 00:11:16,050
So we're all to blame.
Let's just leave it at that.

126
00:11:17,733 --> 00:11:22,602
That's right, Mom. I'm willing to pay the price
for this, even if it means going to jail.

127
00:11:23,973 --> 00:11:27,727
You still think this is
just about you, don't you?

128
00:11:27,813 --> 00:11:31,567
When are you gonna get it through your head

129
00:11:31,653 --> 00:11:36,283
that your father is running
for president of the United States?

130
00:11:36,373 --> 00:11:39,922
A black man. You don't just decide

131
00:11:40,013 --> 00:11:44,165
to ease your conscience at the cost
of what might be best for this country!

132
00:11:44,253 --> 00:11:47,131
- I didn't, Mom!
- Both of you, calm down.

133
00:11:52,493 --> 00:11:57,408
Look, I kept it inside. And I was gonna
suck it up for as long as it took.

134
00:11:58,293 --> 00:12:00,284
But someone murdered Dr Ferragamo.

135
00:12:00,373 --> 00:12:03,285
You can't tell me
hiding that is best for this country.

136
00:12:03,373 --> 00:12:05,887
You know what?

137
00:12:05,973 --> 00:12:08,885
I never saw it until just this minute.

138
00:12:08,973 --> 00:12:11,612
You're your father's son.

139
00:12:11,693 --> 00:12:15,766
You cover up your weakness with a bunch
of bleeding-heart sentimentality.

140
00:12:15,853 --> 00:12:17,411
- That's enough!
- Am I wrong?!

141
00:12:17,493 --> 00:12:21,406
And when are you gonna be man enough
to do what it takes to be president?!

142
00:12:21,493 --> 00:12:24,371
Nicole? Nicole, you OK?

143
00:12:25,053 --> 00:12:27,886
- What's wrong?
- Nicole...

144
00:12:27,973 --> 00:12:30,407
Keith, get me some water.

145
00:12:30,493 --> 00:12:33,132
- Come on. Come on.
- We need a doctor in here!

146
00:12:38,013 --> 00:12:40,288
Easy. Easy.

147
00:12:40,373 --> 00:12:43,126
Easy. Relax. Come here. Gimme your hand.

148
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:57,011
- I'm sorry, Daddy.
- Why? About what?

149
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:02,406
Honey, talk to me.

150
00:13:06,253 --> 00:13:09,882
- This is all my fault.
- Don't you ever say that.

151
00:13:09,973 --> 00:13:14,205
No, sweetheart. Don't you say that.
Everything's gonna be fine.

152
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:16,284
- No.
- Yes, it is.

153
00:13:21,013 --> 00:13:24,608
Sorry, Daddy. I'm sorry.

154
00:13:24,693 --> 00:13:26,684
Sorry, Daddy.

155
00:13:27,853 --> 00:13:31,163
I just got in. I've got some more info
on that location in Saugus.

156
00:13:31,253 --> 00:13:33,244
OK, hold on.

157
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:36,891
- OK, go.
- It comes up as a wildlife preserve.

158
00:13:36,973 --> 00:13:40,443
- Great. We're going to a Sierra Club meeting.
- Who's with you?

159
00:13:40,533 --> 00:13:42,728
Mason. A wildlife preserve in Saugus?

160
00:13:42,813 --> 00:13:46,522
That doesn't make sense. Saugus is
industrial. What about the GPS maps?

161
00:13:46,613 --> 00:13:48,683
- I've got three on the way.
- Good work.

162
00:13:48,773 --> 00:13:52,322
- We'll call you when we find what's out there.
- Yeah, OK.

163
00:13:57,973 --> 00:14:02,364
So correct me if I'm wrong, but this day
basically boils down to a personal vendetta

164
00:14:02,453 --> 00:14:04,648
against you and Palmer by the Drazens.

165
00:14:04,733 --> 00:14:08,203
Yes. Palmer authorised the mission,
I carried it out.

166
00:14:08,293 --> 00:14:11,126
Today is the second anniversary
of Victor Drazen's death.

167
00:14:11,213 --> 00:14:13,647
Happy anniversary.

168
00:14:15,053 --> 00:14:18,045
So what is it we're expecting
to find out here in Saugus?

169
00:14:18,133 --> 00:14:20,124
I don't know yet.

170
00:14:20,973 --> 00:14:24,443
I gotta tell you, Jack,
it never gets dull with you.

171
00:14:26,293 --> 00:14:28,284
Yeah.

172
00:14:28,933 --> 00:14:32,369
Look, for what it's worth,
I'm sorry about last night.

173
00:14:32,453 --> 00:14:36,366
What, shooting me in the leg with a trank?
Don't give it a second thought.

174
00:14:36,453 --> 00:14:42,289
Needless to say, I was pretty wound up. I feel
a lot better now, knowing my family's safe.

175
00:14:46,693 --> 00:14:50,368
- What's the matter?
- No. Just... beat, you know?

176
00:14:50,453 --> 00:14:53,843
- Could use a little sleep.
- Tell me about it.

177
00:15:10,133 --> 00:15:12,328
- How you doing?
- I don't know.

178
00:15:14,493 --> 00:15:17,963
Everything looks familiar
but I don't understand any of it.

179
00:15:18,053 --> 00:15:20,408
I don't feel anything. I should, shouldn't I?

180
00:15:20,493 --> 00:15:22,484
No. Not yet.

181
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:28,724
Sometimes music can help unlock memories.

182
00:15:44,733 --> 00:15:47,452
- Did you ever meet Kim?
- No.

183
00:15:47,533 --> 00:15:50,093
You didn't want her
to know you were seeing anyone.

184
00:15:50,173 --> 00:15:52,846
You said she was taking
Jack's side in the separation.

185
00:15:52,933 --> 00:15:56,687
You didn't wanna give her
any more reason to be angry with you.

186
00:15:56,773 --> 00:15:59,924
And why did my husband... Jack...
Why did Jack leave me?

187
00:16:00,013 --> 00:16:02,288
You asked him to.

188
00:16:02,373 --> 00:16:05,649
You told me he was too removed.

189
00:16:05,733 --> 00:16:08,884
There was no connection
between you two any more.

190
00:16:08,973 --> 00:16:11,362
How about you and I?

191
00:16:14,093 --> 00:16:17,130
- I thought there was one.
- But, what, I didn't?

192
00:16:19,133 --> 00:16:21,328
Truth is, I think you did.

193
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:24,928
But you were scared.
You didn't wanna lose your family.

194
00:16:25,613 --> 00:16:28,605
And when Jack asked
to move back in, you let him.

195
00:16:33,213 --> 00:16:35,363
- It's funny.
- What?

196
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:38,047
I don't remember you at all.

197
00:16:38,133 --> 00:16:44,288
But being with you makes me feel good,
and... maybe I don't feel so scared.

198
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:55,402
Thank you for doing this, Phil.

199
00:17:02,973 --> 00:17:05,612
Did Chuck come through?

200
00:17:05,693 --> 00:17:08,685
I hope not. Just park in the back.

201
00:17:09,693 --> 00:17:12,685
- Just sit tight.
- I can't stay here. I need to find my mom.

202
00:17:12,773 --> 00:17:15,890
- I don't know how to get you outta here.
- I'll make a run for it.

203
00:17:15,973 --> 00:17:19,602
I wouldn't. Frank's a psycho.
You don't wanna cross him.

204
00:17:21,093 --> 00:17:23,084
- I'm gonna go.
- No.

205
00:17:30,693 --> 00:17:34,288
Hey, hey, hey, hey! No, no, no, no, no.
Get in the kitchen.

206
00:17:35,413 --> 00:17:37,404
Come on in, man.

207
00:17:39,013 --> 00:17:41,288
You, be careful.

208
00:17:42,213 --> 00:17:45,489
No, he's cool. Come on. It's all right.

209
00:17:48,613 --> 00:17:50,604
Let's see it.

210
00:18:00,213 --> 00:18:02,363
Yeah.

211
00:18:02,453 --> 00:18:05,684
- That's what I'm talking about.
- These the guys with the ecstasy?

212
00:18:05,773 --> 00:18:09,129
- No, these are just friends of mine.
- Frank, what are you gonna do?

213
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:12,330
What does it look like?
We can't pay if we don't have any money.

214
00:18:12,413 --> 00:18:14,608
- You're gonna rip 'em off?
- Yeah.

215
00:18:31,013 --> 00:18:33,004
- Thank you.
- Mm-hm.

216
00:18:35,813 --> 00:18:39,169
- You all right, honey?
- I'm absolutely fine, Daddy.

217
00:18:39,653 --> 00:18:42,611
- Good.
- Go ahead. They're waiting for you.

218
00:18:44,133 --> 00:18:46,966
OK. I'm gonna head down now.

219
00:18:57,853 --> 00:18:59,844
This is a test for us.

220
00:19:01,173 --> 00:19:04,722
If we love each other, support each other...

221
00:19:09,733 --> 00:19:12,327
nothing else will matter.

222
00:19:17,973 --> 00:19:19,964
Sherry?

223
00:19:23,253 --> 00:19:25,642
I need you now more than ever.

224
00:19:47,413 --> 00:19:51,326
I've always liked this tie on you, David.

225
00:19:53,413 --> 00:19:56,086
Senator? It's time.

226
00:20:30,013 --> 00:20:32,208
Anything look familiar?

227
00:20:32,293 --> 00:20:37,845
It's so weird. Looking at what I did for the last
few months, it doesn't mean anything to me.

228
00:20:37,933 --> 00:20:42,131
"Yvonne's birthday. "
"Kim in Cambria for the weekend. "

229
00:20:44,293 --> 00:20:47,285
"Dinner with Phil. Ivy at the Shore. "

230
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:51,045
Was it nice?

231
00:20:51,133 --> 00:20:53,647
Well, the wait was over an hour, so...

232
00:20:54,693 --> 00:20:58,288
we decided to walk down the pier
and have some hot dogs.

233
00:20:59,853 --> 00:21:02,128
And you beat me at air hockey.

234
00:21:06,413 --> 00:21:09,211
Air hockey, huh?

235
00:21:14,693 --> 00:21:17,127
What's in there for today?

236
00:21:17,213 --> 00:21:22,651
Nothing. Although yesterday I had
a conference call with Kitty, whoever that is.

237
00:21:22,733 --> 00:21:26,328
Kitty - she's a friend of yours.
You work with her sometimes.

238
00:21:26,413 --> 00:21:30,292
You do commercial interior design.
It's just freelance right now,

239
00:21:30,373 --> 00:21:33,922
but you wanna expand
when Kim goes off to college.

240
00:21:34,013 --> 00:21:38,086
How come I can sort of remember air hockey
but I can't remember what I do for a living?

241
00:21:40,693 --> 00:21:42,968
- Maybe that's Jack.
- He wouldn't ring the bell.

242
00:21:43,053 --> 00:21:48,525
It's probably my friend Chris. Remember? I
wanted someone here, to be on the safe side.

243
00:21:48,613 --> 00:21:51,002
- Yeah.
- Stay here, just in case.

244
00:21:58,293 --> 00:22:01,968
- Hey, Phil.
- Hey, Chris. Thanks for coming.

245
00:22:03,493 --> 00:22:05,723
- Teri, this is Chris.
- Hi.

246
00:22:07,133 --> 00:22:09,169
- Why does he have a gun?
- He's here to...

247
00:22:09,253 --> 00:22:12,006
I don't care. Get him
outta the house with that gun.

248
00:22:12,093 --> 00:22:15,051
Chris, will you just
give us a couple of minutes, OK?

249
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:17,522
- Yeah. Sure.
- Thanks.

250
00:22:22,093 --> 00:22:26,211
- Teri, Chris is a friend of mine...
- That doesn't mean anything to me.

251
00:22:26,293 --> 00:22:30,252
I don't know who you are. I don't know
who he is. I don't want any guns.

252
00:22:30,333 --> 00:22:33,530
OK. I'll tell him to stay outside. Is that OK?

253
00:22:34,773 --> 00:22:37,606
But we need him here, just in case.

254
00:22:37,693 --> 00:22:41,572
Teri, your husband could have been
the one who roughed you up.

255
00:22:41,653 --> 00:22:43,644
I want you safe.

256
00:22:45,693 --> 00:22:47,684
Teri, look at me.

257
00:22:48,573 --> 00:22:50,564
Look at me.

258
00:22:52,413 --> 00:22:54,404
I'm your friend.

259
00:22:54,493 --> 00:22:57,644
You trust me. You told me so yourself.

260
00:22:58,373 --> 00:23:01,365
So you're gonna have to trust my judgment.

261
00:23:03,293 --> 00:23:05,568
OK.

262
00:23:06,613 --> 00:23:10,572
- What's going on over there?
- The wife is here.

263
00:23:10,653 --> 00:23:12,291
- The daughter?
- No.

264
00:23:13,093 --> 00:23:16,529
- What are you waiting for?
- There's a little interference.

265
00:23:16,613 --> 00:23:19,446
But it'll pass soon. Did you find Alexis?

266
00:23:19,533 --> 00:23:21,205
Not yet.

267
00:23:21,293 --> 00:23:23,932
- Call me when it's done.
- Yes.

268
00:23:38,253 --> 00:23:42,565
Ladies and gentlemen of the press,
if you will please take your seats now.

269
00:23:42,653 --> 00:23:46,441
Senator Palmer is just about here.
We will begin.

270
00:24:00,813 --> 00:24:03,202
Senator Palmer?

271
00:24:05,013 --> 00:24:08,972
Last night I received a phone call
regarding my son, Keith,

272
00:24:09,053 --> 00:24:11,089
and my daughter, Nicole.

273
00:24:11,173 --> 00:24:16,452
That call has unfortunately set offal chain
of events that has culminated in a tragedy.

274
00:24:18,053 --> 00:24:23,685
Whether or not what I have to say jeopardises
my campaign is for the voters to decide.

275
00:24:23,773 --> 00:24:25,968
I'm doing this for my family.

276
00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:31,326
A large portion of the
financial support for my campaign

277
00:24:31,413 --> 00:24:35,850
comes from a group of businessmen
right here in Los Angeles.

278
00:24:35,933 --> 00:24:40,131
- Every presidential campaign relies on...
- I'll take care of it.

279
00:24:41,453 --> 00:24:43,762
Too late, Carl.

280
00:24:45,173 --> 00:24:48,051
I have apparently misjudged
these local businessmen.

281
00:24:48,133 --> 00:24:51,728
More importantly, they have misjudged me.

282
00:25:00,093 --> 00:25:04,086
How it was acquired,
I am not at liberty to say.

283
00:25:04,933 --> 00:25:10,371
I have already handed this incriminating tape
over to the Justice Department.

284
00:25:10,453 --> 00:25:13,286
Whether or not it's admissible in court,

285
00:25:13,373 --> 00:25:17,969
it will still implicate the men
who have been supporting my campaign.

286
00:25:18,973 --> 00:25:20,964
I'll emphasise again

287
00:25:21,053 --> 00:25:25,365
that these men acted without
my consent or my knowledge.

288
00:25:27,653 --> 00:25:30,121
As for my son, Keith,

289
00:25:30,853 --> 00:25:36,723
he is prepared to turn himself in and face any
consequences a grand jury deems necessary.

290
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:41,251
He is my son, and I love him.

291
00:25:42,173 --> 00:25:44,482
And I will stand by him.

292
00:25:44,573 --> 00:25:47,451
I am confident that
when presented with the facts

293
00:25:47,533 --> 00:25:51,811
it will be clear that there was
no criminal intent or wrongdoing.

294
00:25:51,893 --> 00:25:55,602
He will only be guilty
of not reporting an accident.

295
00:25:57,213 --> 00:25:59,363
As for my daughter, Nicole,

296
00:26:01,653 --> 00:26:06,932
it is important for everyone to remember
she was the victim of a horrible crime.

297
00:26:07,013 --> 00:26:09,811
A physical and psychological crime.

298
00:26:10,733 --> 00:26:13,725
She is not a source of information.

299
00:26:16,013 --> 00:26:19,403
This is about the cover-up
of an accidental death.

300
00:26:20,253 --> 00:26:23,006
This is not about rape.

301
00:26:23,093 --> 00:26:28,292
So I'm asking you now, as a father,
please find your humanity

302
00:26:28,373 --> 00:26:32,571
and spare Nicole the indignity
of having to relive this nightmare.

303
00:26:36,133 --> 00:26:40,012
- We lost track of both of 'em.
- How long have you known this?

304
00:26:40,093 --> 00:26:42,527
- Does Jack know about this?
- Nina. Nina!

305
00:26:42,613 --> 00:26:45,411
- Not that I'm aware of.
- Did you know the safe house was hit?

306
00:26:45,493 --> 00:26:48,610
- Relax, OK?
- Tony, answer me!

307
00:26:49,293 --> 00:26:52,126
- Yes, I knew.
- Why didn't you tell me?!

308
00:26:52,213 --> 00:26:56,172
Look, Mason didn't want you to know
cos he didn't want you to tell Jack.

309
00:26:56,253 --> 00:26:58,642
His family is missing! He should know that.

310
00:26:58,733 --> 00:27:02,612
Yeah, I'm with you on this.
Look, Mason gave the order, all right?

311
00:27:02,693 --> 00:27:05,651
He's deployed resources.
He's called locals to help find 'em.

312
00:27:05,733 --> 00:27:08,167
You should have told me. You work for me.

313
00:27:08,253 --> 00:27:10,528
And you work for Mason.

314
00:27:12,093 --> 00:27:15,927
This is my fault.
I should never have left Teri and Kim.

315
00:27:16,013 --> 00:27:19,449
Nina, you're not a field agent, all right?
What could you have done?

316
00:27:19,533 --> 00:27:21,842
Jack needs to know about this.

317
00:27:27,893 --> 00:27:31,522
- Mason.
- Have you told Jack about his family yet?

318
00:27:31,613 --> 00:27:35,811
- No, we're not there yet.
- You can't do this. You have to tell him.

319
00:27:35,893 --> 00:27:39,602
- Uh-huh.
- Let him know so he can help us find them.

320
00:27:39,693 --> 00:27:42,526
They're exposed.
If Drazen's people find them first...

321
00:27:42,613 --> 00:27:45,525
- That's a good idea.
- Listen to me, George.

322
00:27:45,613 --> 00:27:49,572
If anything happens to them he's gonna
hold you responsible. Think about that.

323
00:27:49,653 --> 00:27:52,042
I will. OK, let me know
if you have any progress.

324
00:27:52,133 --> 00:27:54,601
George!

325
00:27:54,693 --> 00:27:57,082
Nina...

326
00:28:01,173 --> 00:28:04,449
Jack, my battery just died.
Can I use your phone for a sec?

327
00:28:04,533 --> 00:28:07,001
Yeah, sure.

328
00:28:08,053 --> 00:28:09,008
Thanks.

329
00:28:17,573 --> 00:28:21,805
Yeah, it's me. No, all I wanna say is
keep the backup units on stand-by, all right?

330
00:28:21,893 --> 00:28:26,250
The cellular customer
you are trying to reach is unavailable.

331
00:28:26,333 --> 00:28:29,131
- OK.
- I got a signal.

332
00:28:52,773 --> 00:28:55,890
- What'd Nina have to say?
- She's just checking our location.

333
00:28:55,973 --> 00:28:57,691
What does GPS say?

334
00:28:57,773 --> 00:29:01,402
It doesn't make sense. It's saying
the address is right up ahead.

335
00:29:01,493 --> 00:29:04,769
I know the whole thing was hush-hush,
but who was Victor Drazen?

336
00:29:04,853 --> 00:29:09,165
Drazen was Milosevic's shadow. He was
in charge of all of his covert operations.

337
00:29:09,253 --> 00:29:13,963
He was responsible for organising the ethnic
cleansing campaigns in Kosovo, Sarajevo

338
00:29:14,053 --> 00:29:16,283
and Bosnia.

339
00:29:16,373 --> 00:29:18,648
- Your unit took him out?
- That's right.

340
00:29:18,733 --> 00:29:21,122
- You rolled the whole deal up?
- Yeah.

341
00:29:22,893 --> 00:29:27,569
So who'd have the kind of influence to run an
operation like this against you and Palmer?

342
00:29:27,653 --> 00:29:31,043
My guess would be Serbian military exiles.
They could pull this off.

343
00:29:31,133 --> 00:29:34,250
Alexis and Andre pulled together
a cell without us knowing.

344
00:29:34,333 --> 00:29:38,372
It's a hell of a cell to be able
to infiltrate the CTU, turn Jamey.

345
00:29:38,453 --> 00:29:43,925
I agree. It's hard to believe Jamey could work
against us without some kind of umbrella.

346
00:29:45,453 --> 00:29:48,604
Any ideas why the Serbs
would wanna spend this much money

347
00:29:48,693 --> 00:29:51,526
to turn the power off
in the middle of the woods?

348
00:29:51,613 --> 00:29:53,604
No.

349
00:29:55,613 --> 00:29:59,208
George, look. A power transformer.

350
00:30:09,973 --> 00:30:12,362
The lock on it's new.

351
00:30:13,373 --> 00:30:17,286
Why would this be designated
as a wildlife sanctuary? Think about it.

352
00:30:17,373 --> 00:30:21,764
There's no water. No water, no wetlands.
No wetlands, no birds, no animals...

353
00:30:21,853 --> 00:30:24,572
No nothing, as far as I can make out.

354
00:30:33,093 --> 00:30:36,290
Here they are, man. Let's get ready.

355
00:30:44,813 --> 00:30:47,008
Right on time. I like that.

356
00:30:59,893 --> 00:31:03,647
- Who the hell's this?
- Just some friends of mine. It's cool.

357
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:10,847
How you know Frankie?

358
00:31:10,933 --> 00:31:12,924
I'm a friend of Rick's.

359
00:31:13,013 --> 00:31:15,208
Who's Rick?

360
00:31:16,773 --> 00:31:19,571
- I am.
- Ah. And what happened to you?

361
00:31:19,653 --> 00:31:22,167
We gonna play twenty questions
or do business?

362
00:31:22,253 --> 00:31:26,371
I just wanna know who's in the room.
You got a problem with that?

363
00:31:27,573 --> 00:31:32,044
No, man. Knock yourself out. Get a medical
history, take a urine sample for all I care.

364
00:31:32,133 --> 00:31:34,363
Let's just get on with it. Come on.

365
00:31:36,533 --> 00:31:42,324
- Fine. Let's do this. Got the cash, Frankie?
- I got what you need. Let's see the E first.

366
00:31:42,413 --> 00:31:44,404
OK.

367
00:31:46,413 --> 00:31:50,929
Pure MDMA. No caffeine. Wanna check it?

368
00:31:51,493 --> 00:31:53,768
No, man. I trust you.

369
00:31:55,613 --> 00:31:59,083
All right, homey. Where's the money?

370
00:32:01,013 --> 00:32:03,208
Did you hear that?

371
00:32:03,293 --> 00:32:05,284
This guy called me "homey".

372
00:32:05,373 --> 00:32:07,603
I got your money.

373
00:32:07,693 --> 00:32:10,082
It's right here.

374
00:32:15,733 --> 00:32:17,644
Stand down!

375
00:32:21,813 --> 00:32:24,885
Come on, homey.
Stand down or you're eating one.

376
00:32:25,573 --> 00:32:28,690
You pull that trigger, you're going down too.

377
00:32:30,533 --> 00:32:33,843
Let's just do 'em! Let's do 'em.

378
00:32:38,653 --> 00:32:40,450
All right.

379
00:32:40,533 --> 00:32:44,162
Everybody chill out, man. It's all cool.
We're gonna put the guns down.

380
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:46,483
On the ground. Nice and easy.

381
00:32:46,573 --> 00:32:50,452
- It's going down.
- Let's go. See what else they got on 'em.

382
00:32:50,533 --> 00:32:52,330
Get down.

383
00:32:53,133 --> 00:32:56,330
All this cos you couldn't
keep my brother alive.

384
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:16,684
They might not have registered
with their real names.

385
00:33:16,773 --> 00:33:20,163
No, just use the description
that we sent you, OK?

386
00:33:22,253 --> 00:33:25,450
- You checking the hospitals?
- Yes.

387
00:33:25,533 --> 00:33:28,605
I don't understand how
Teri and Kim just disappeared.

388
00:33:28,693 --> 00:33:33,813
Well, it might be a good thing. If Drazen's
people had them, we'd have heard about it.

389
00:33:33,893 --> 00:33:36,612
After all, Jack and Palmer
are the primary targets.

390
00:33:36,693 --> 00:33:40,322
- What about Jack's house?
- I sent Williams over, but I'll check on him.

391
00:33:40,413 --> 00:33:44,201
- And Kim's phone call?
- A phone booth. We're checking the area.

392
00:33:44,293 --> 00:33:47,251
Look, Nina, we're doing
everything we can, right?

393
00:33:47,333 --> 00:33:49,324
Are you?

394
00:34:15,853 --> 00:34:19,163
What you gonna do now, man? Kill us?

395
00:34:26,813 --> 00:34:28,804
Yeah.

396
00:34:32,333 --> 00:34:35,166
I'll kill you...

397
00:34:35,253 --> 00:34:37,642
if I ever see you again.

398
00:34:40,213 --> 00:34:42,681
You should get that stitched, man.

399
00:34:43,853 --> 00:34:47,163
- How's that for a nose job?
- Pretty good. I like it.

400
00:34:49,693 --> 00:34:52,685
- Hey, Frankie?
- What's that, homey?

401
00:34:56,293 --> 00:34:58,329
Speak up.

402
00:34:59,533 --> 00:35:02,445
You have the right to remain silent.

403
00:35:04,053 --> 00:35:06,123
Everybody freeze!

404
00:35:18,613 --> 00:35:22,731
- Arrest all of 'em.
- Please, don't do this. We didn't do anything.

405
00:35:22,813 --> 00:35:24,804
- We're not a part of this!
- Arms up!

406
00:35:24,893 --> 00:35:27,487
Up against the wall.

407
00:35:27,973 --> 00:35:30,123
Let me have your Handie.

408
00:35:33,453 --> 00:35:36,126
This is Krugman. We got a code four.

409
00:35:36,213 --> 00:35:39,011
One suspect down, five being booked.

410
00:35:40,813 --> 00:35:43,202
I think I got a broken nose.

411
00:35:46,813 --> 00:35:51,807
Look, I'll say it again. I bear
full responsibility for not knowing about it.

412
00:35:53,893 --> 00:35:56,168
A senator's duty,

413
00:35:56,253 --> 00:35:59,962
a president's duty,
an elected representative's duty,

414
00:36:00,053 --> 00:36:02,283
is not only to his country

415
00:36:02,373 --> 00:36:04,568
but also to his family.

416
00:36:05,813 --> 00:36:10,489
If he cannot manage the interactions
of the people close to him,

417
00:36:10,573 --> 00:36:15,442
then he can't expect the electorate
to believe in his abilities to lead a nation.

418
00:36:16,373 --> 00:36:19,171
I don't deny I made a mistake.

419
00:36:19,253 --> 00:36:21,642
A serious one.

420
00:36:21,733 --> 00:36:27,888
I only ask you to consider that I am not
the first person in public office to make one.

421
00:36:29,173 --> 00:36:31,164
Thank you.

422
00:36:52,693 --> 00:36:54,888
I love you, Dad.

423
00:36:55,933 --> 00:36:58,288
I love you, son.

424
00:37:20,253 --> 00:37:25,043
This is Emily. She's eleven.
And this is Jennifer. She just turned nine.

425
00:37:25,933 --> 00:37:28,572
- And I didn't meet them?
- No.

426
00:37:28,653 --> 00:37:33,522
We decided to leave everyone outside of it
until you were sure what you wanted.

427
00:37:33,613 --> 00:37:36,002
I'll get it.

428
00:38:00,253 --> 00:38:02,244
She made this for me.

429
00:38:03,293 --> 00:38:05,932
You want milk or sugar in it?

430
00:38:06,013 --> 00:38:08,004
Yeah.

431
00:38:09,413 --> 00:38:14,009
- Phil, I think I'm remembering something.
- Really? I'll be right there.

432
00:38:17,973 --> 00:38:20,567
- Rest room?
- Right down the hall.

433
00:38:25,573 --> 00:38:27,325
Teri!

434
00:38:38,693 --> 00:38:40,684
Where's the girl?

435
00:38:42,733 --> 00:38:45,372
Your daughter. Where is she?

436
00:38:46,653 --> 00:38:49,008
I... I don't know!

437
00:38:49,093 --> 00:38:53,530
Tell me where she is and I'll make this
painless for both of you, I promise.

438
00:38:53,613 --> 00:38:55,808
I... I don't know.

439
00:38:57,253 --> 00:38:59,084
Fine.

440
00:39:01,373 --> 00:39:04,251
Oh, God!

441
00:39:04,333 --> 00:39:06,483
Teri, step away.

442
00:39:06,573 --> 00:39:08,564
Move away, Teri.

443
00:39:08,653 --> 00:39:11,451
- Oh, my God.
- Teri, step away, please!

444
00:39:14,253 --> 00:39:18,041
The car... Oh, my God, the car...

445
00:39:18,133 --> 00:39:20,647
I lost Kimberly!

446
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:22,803
Teri, it's OK. You're safe.

447
00:39:22,893 --> 00:39:24,884
I lost Kimberly!

448
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:51,123
GPS says this is it.

449
00:39:51,853 --> 00:39:53,844
Yeah, right.

450
00:40:01,173 --> 00:40:03,562
What's that? Reconnaissance?

451
00:40:04,933 --> 00:40:07,766
Someone knows we're here.
