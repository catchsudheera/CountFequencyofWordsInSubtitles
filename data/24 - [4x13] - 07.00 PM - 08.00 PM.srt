1
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,476
Here are all the access codes
to CTU and Division.

2
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:21,269
- Thanks.
- I'm probably gonna be gone for a while.

3
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,511
If you need anything,
you can always call me at home.

4
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,955
<i> Sir,</i>
<i>Ms Driscoll's replacement arrived. </i>

5
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,712
Tony, thank you for filling in.

6
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,234
And I'd like you to stick around
and assist Ms Dessler.

7
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,710
- Who?
- Michelle Dessler. Do you know her?

8
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,598
I used to be married to her.

9
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,674
- I have to go to McLennan-Forster.
- Why there?

10
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,910
Turns out the man
we're looking for works there.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,878
- Need to get into their computer system?
- Yeah.

12
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,279
OK. I'll go with you.

13
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,711
So how can I help CTU?

14
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:55,395
One of your employees,
Harris Barnes, is actually Habib Marwan,

15
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:59,189
a terrorist responsible for today's
attack and theft of the override.

16
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,273
We need you to take your IT systems offline
so Paul can look into his directory.

17
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,833
CTU will subpoena those files.
They will find out the truth.

18
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,512
- Dammit!
- What's he doing?

19
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,636
He's trying to rebuild the files I deleted.

20
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,551
Look at this.

21
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:20,512
Son of a bitch, it's encrypted.
That's it. Print it out, now. Now!

22
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,875
He's gonna find evidence
we sold arms to terrorists.

23
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,839
The pulse bomb. We have to use it now.

24
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,352
We're dealing with an EMP.

25
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:33,638
Once it goes off, everything
within its radius that's electrical gets fried.

26
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,869
I'm gonna try and stop it.

27
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,316
If I don't, take the hard copy,
meet me in front of the building.

28
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:43,154
CTU agent's heading down near you.
Don't let him near it.

29
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,949
Oh, my God.

30
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,430
Are any electronic devices working?

31
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,193
<i> Only the basic battery-powered devices. </i>

32
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:22,239
- How many square miles are affected?
- <i>80, including southeast downtown. </i>

33
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,357
OK. Hold your position
until the readings stabilise.

34
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,079
- Any word from Jack or Paul?
- No.

35
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,799
Once the bomb went off
we lost communication.

36
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:34,759
- What was the last we heard from them?
- Jack and Paul found something.

37
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,513
It must be incriminating
to McLennan-Forster.

38
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,114
So they set off the EMP
to destroy the evidence.

39
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,349
That's my guess.

40
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,752
The fact that McLennan-Forster
is taking action is evidence against them.

41
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,638
Yeah, but it's not proof.

42
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,110
Curtis.

43
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:00,877
- Could Jack or Paul have been injured?
- No. An EMP only damages electronics.

44
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,599
But it doesn't mean they're safe.

45
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:11,115
We know you printed a document
before the EMP detonated.

46
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,350
Where is it?

47
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:21,390
It's up to you.
You decide when the pain stops.

48
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,549
- Call me when he talks.
- Yes, sir.

49
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,796
No!

50
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:03,278
Drop your gun or I'll kill him.

51
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,834
I said drop it!

52
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:18,437
Paul, where's the data printout?

53
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:22,195
I hid it in an office down the hallway.

54
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:28,071
I know you're hurt, but we've gotta get it
and get out of here. Let's go.

55
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,678
Let's go.

56
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,075
It's in here.

57
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,117
Take a seat.

58
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,998
- Where is it?
- Bottom drawer, under some folders.

59
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,470
I hid it because I thought I might be captured.

60
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,639
- Is this it?
- Yeah, it's in code.

61
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,518
I couldn't make any sense out of it.

62
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,674
We need to get it back to CTU.

63
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:27,197
- I couldn't have held out much longer.
- You did great.

64
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,080
Let's go.

65
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,313
For those who don't know,
this is Michelle Dessler.

66
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,154
She'll be taking over as acting director of CTU
effective immediately.

67
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,357
Tony, I appreciate you carrying the ball
until she got here.

68
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,908
Why don't you
bring everyone up to speed?

69
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,309
Yes, sir.

70
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:10,989
Less than an hour ago, we discovered that the
man responsible for planning today's attacks,

71
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:14,959
Habib Marwan, has been a long-term
employee of McLennan-Forster,

72
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,350
the third-largest defence contractor
in the country.

73
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,796
We know that Marwan's
been using the alias "Harris Barnes".

74
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:25,031
What we don't know
is how he evaded their security checks.

75
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,759
He knows we're after him
so he's probably gone dark.

76
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,957
His association with McLennan-Forster
is our main focus.

77
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,191
Jack and Paul Raines
went to inspect his computer files,

78
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:37,192
but as they were doing so,
an EMP bomb was detonated,

79
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,510
wiping out the company's database.

80
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,672
It fried every electrical device
in an eight-mile radius -

81
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:46,958
streetlights, computers,
cars, cellphones, everything.

82
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,508
Did they find anything before detonation?

83
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,034
Yeah, but we haven't
been able to contact them.

84
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,680
But we have to assume
whoever detonated the EMP

85
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,228
wants Jack and Paul eliminated.

86
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:00,630
- Have rescue teams been sent into the area?
- Not yet.

87
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,998
Once the effects subside we'll send
two teams in with functioning electronics.

88
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,993
The problem is until we find Jack
and Paul, they won't be able to do much.

89
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:12,914
We want to do everything we can
to find Jack Bauer and Paul Raines,

90
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,916
but the priority is to retrieve any information
they found at McLennan-Forster.

91
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,514
That's all.

92
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,791
Tony.

93
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:34,151
I need the access codes for CTU and Division.

94
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,312
- Thank you.
- What do you want me to do?

95
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:45,394
Division's sending over a supplemental list
of terrorists who've had contact with Marwan.

96
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:50,554
Check any names that have been flagged
by other agencies, including overseas.

97
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:54,952
Given what's happening right now,
doesn't seem like the best use of my time.

98
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,349
It has to be done and I'd like you to do it.

99
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,194
Michelle, Jack and Paul have information
that could end this crisis.

100
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,078
I should be helping us find them. Michelle!

101
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,197
When I last saw you,
you couldn't stay sober to keep a job.

102
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,475
That was six months ago.

103
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,071
This is what I need you to do.

104
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,833
If you don't like it, you can resign.

105
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,750
I'm gonna need a security clearance.

106
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,274
I'll make sure you get a level three.

107
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,158
Level three? I used to have a six.

108
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,038
Right now, all you need is three.

109
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,113
Is there a problem with Agent Almeida?

110
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,792
Not at all.

111
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:51,159
It's just that Secretary Heller is very sensitive
to personal conflicts on the job.

112
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,629
I know your history,
I know you were married

113
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,837
and that he sacrificed his career
to save your life.

114
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:01,596
- But if this is gonna be a problem, I...
- His being here will not affect my work.

115
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:07,516
Now, if Secretary Heller wants to speak to me
about it, I'll be more than glad to.

116
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,955
<i>We are receiving reports from LAPD</i>

117
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:16,636
<i>indicating that there is widespread looting</i>
<i>going on in the blacked-out zone. </i>

118
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,917
<i>A number of cars have been set on fire</i>
<i>and stores ransacked. </i>

119
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,310
<i>Witnesses report shots were heard. </i>
<i>There may be casualties. </i>

120
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,470
<i>We just don't know at this time. </i>

121
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,279
That could be the same people
that were after Jack.

122
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,557
I don't get it. What could be worth
setting off a pulse bomb?

123
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,596
Something implicating McLennan-Forster.

124
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,832
Anything they're doing now is insignificant
if they helped Marwan today.

125
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,952
- This is Anderson.
- <i> It's time for you to go. </i>

126
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,190
Marwan, your face is all over the news.

127
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:13,317
Don't worry about it.
Things will proceed as planned.

128
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:16,119
- Are you ready?
- Yes, of course.

129
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,431
- <i>How long will it take you to get there?</i>
- Less than 30 minutes.

130
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,193
I'll inform the others.

131
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:02,998
It's heading to McLennan-Forster.
It's not responding to any of our ID requests.

132
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:06,390
- You're sure?
- Yeah, I'm positive.

133
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,118
Michelle.

134
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,191
Excuse me.

135
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,554
There's a chopper in the dead zone,
not one of ours.

136
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,108
- Police?
- Not one of theirs either. I checked.

137
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,760
We picked it up by its electronic signature.

138
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,593
- Where's it going?
- Straight to McLennan-Forster.

139
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,717
Could it be some sort of
corporate rescue chopper?

140
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:29,554
- They'd give the police a call sign.
- It's a search-and-destroy mission.

141
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,313
A chopper that size
carries 20 men, fully armed.

142
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:36,359
- Who would have sent it?
- Whoever set off the EMP, they're after Jack.

143
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:39,716
McLennan-Forster's been training
mercenaries for years.

144
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:44,669
Contact our field teams in the air.
Let them know about the intruding chopper.

145
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,311
I'll be right back.

146
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,591
- Jack, I can't do this.
- You don't have a choice. Come on.

147
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,359
Get me some gear!

148
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:24,638
These are the men we're looking for.
They have an encoded computer print-out.

149
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,917
We need to erase these two men
and recover the document.

150
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,514
Just be aware,
one of them is a CTU field agent.

151
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,956
- You want us to kill a federal agent?
- I'll take care of him.

152
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:37,350
He went bad, helped the terrorists,
dragged the company into it.

153
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,396
LAPD is responding to this area.

154
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:44,315
We'll have to do this quickly if we want to
stay off their radar. Use that to keep in touch.

155
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,039
We spotted two men
headed east on Addison.

156
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,272
Deploy your men in a flanking position
a mile down the road and then move in.

157
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,193
- We'll fan out and come in from behind.
- You got it.

158
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:57,158
Get me that chopper
back in the northwest corner.

159
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,231
Let's move.

160
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,751
Come on.

161
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,148
Come on, this way.

162
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,434
This way.

163
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:28,231
- Why are we going here?
- Weapons and ammunition.

164
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,194
Get away from here!
- Paul, get down!

165
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,748
Get out of here!
The next one won't miss!

166
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:43,469
- I'm a federal agent.
Sure you are. Get away from here.

167
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,551
Look, we need your help.

168
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,718
Go! Now!

169
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,519
Hey, just relax. I'm leaving.

170
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,636
OK? I'm leaving.

171
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,796
Drop the weapon! Now!

172
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,348
Kick the gun over to me.

173
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,519
- Paul!
- Yeah?

174
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,909
Get in here.

175
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,429
Pick up that gun.

176
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:16,192
My name is Jack Bauer. I am a federal agent.

177
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,510
You should have helped stop the looting.

178
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,160
You still have any rifles
or did they get them too?

179
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:24,516
- Behind the counter, yeah.
- Show me.

180
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,919
Look, we're the first to be hit
because we're Arabs.

181
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,515
- We had nothing to do with what happened...
- Quiet. He doesn't care.

182
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:41,119
Take what you need, but leave two guns. We
chased the looters once, but they'll be back.

183
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,430
Just stay there.

184
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,275
Give me the keys.

185
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,349
What are you guys doing here?

186
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:03,116
- We needed to take cover.
- What do you mean? Who's after you?

187
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,589
It has to do with the terrorist attacks.

188
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:09,717
I have evidence
that I need to get to the authorities.

189
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,189
The men chasing us caused this blackout.

190
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:15,670
They detonated a device
called an electromagnetic pulse bomb.

191
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,638
It destroys electrical activity
within eight miles.

192
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:24,670
So everything that's happened, the looting,
the blackout, it's all because of the terrorists?

193
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:28,355
Yes, and the evidence that I have
can help prevent further attacks.

194
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,352
Jack, the commandos
will be here any minute.

195
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,479
- Commandos?
- He's right. You need to leave this store.

196
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:38,518
Right now we're their target.
You're not safe here.

197
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,990
- Why don't you leave? It's our store.
- If I had a choice, I would,

198
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,640
but you have weapons and shelter.

199
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,474
Right now there's no other place for us to be.

200
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,039
Can I talk to my brother for a second?

201
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,634
Stay where I can see you.

202
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,869
What's the plan?

203
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:13,318
CTU knows that we can't contact them. They
can view this area with satellite and infrared.

204
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:17,154
McLennan-Forster's commandos
arrived in a military helicopter.

205
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,879
CTU had to see that on satellite.

206
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,520
If we can initiate a large-enough firefight,

207
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:26,149
we can force their commandos
to communicate their positions.

208
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,879
- And CTU will pick up the signal?
- Yes.

209
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:33,317
So you want to engage the
McLennan-Forster army, just the two of us?

210
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,675
We have a positional advantage.

211
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,718
And we only have to hold down
till CTU gets here.

212
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,234
...nothing, all right?
- All right.

213
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,880
My brother and I talked about this.

214
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,311
We're staying.

215
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,950
I can't force you to leave your own property,

216
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,270
but this is not just a bunch of looters.

217
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,239
This is a very dangerous situation.
I cannot guarantee your safety.

218
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:12,792
You don't understand. For years we've been
blamed for the attacks by these terrorists.

219
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,155
We grew up in this neighbourhood.

220
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,117
This country is our home.

221
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:23,196
If you're fighting the people who caused
today's bloodshed, then we'll help you.

222
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:41,152
The president should stay in the air
at least another hour, if not longer.

223
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:45,916
If he wants to speak to the nation,
he should do it from Air Force One.

224
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,151
- Keep me informed.
- <i> Yes, sir. </i>

225
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:56,470
I have an update from the San Gabriel Island
meltdown. It's not as bad as we had feared.

226
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:59,279
How you doing?

227
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,954
Sit down.

228
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,629
Any word from Jack or Paul?

229
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,556
No.

230
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:15,474
I can't imagine how hard this must be for you.

231
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,273
There's something else, isn't there?

232
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,430
A couple hours ago,

233
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:28,958
when we thought that Paul was involved
with the attacks, Jack questioned him.

234
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,634
And Paul has his pride, so he resisted, but...

235
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:34,188
Jack was pretty rough?

236
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,269
Very.

237
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,238
That's his job.
He had to make sure.

238
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,998
You have to believe that Jack had no choice.

239
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:48,277
I know. I guess it was just a shock to see it.

240
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:53,757
Somehow he seemed like a different person.

241
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,752
We need people like that, Audrey.

242
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:01,477
Jack is an incredible man. I just...

243
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:04,950
But you're not sure you feel
the same way as before, is that it?

244
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,349
Something like that.

245
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:31,152
Can I speak to you for a moment?
It's important.

246
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,596
OK. I don't have much time.

247
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,990
You're aware I was falsely accused
of leaking information.

248
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,868
- Yes, I saw the report.
- Erin Driscoll didn't talk to you about it?

249
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:45,316
Her daughter died.
I think she has other things on her mind.

250
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:49,598
I understand, but there are some things
that still need to be handled.

251
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,669
What things?

252
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:53,797
She promised that it would be expunged
from my record,

253
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:58,032
and I'd be bumped up two pay grades,
so I want to make sure that will still happen.

254
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,111
I'll look into it, but not today.

255
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,590
What happened to me was an outrage.

256
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:09,676
If you don't do something to resolve it
right now, I'll go directly to Secretary Heller.

257
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:14,755
Secretary Heller doesn't run CTU.

258
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:18,549
I do. And I am ordering you
to go back to work.

259
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:24,749
Not until you assure me the false accusation
will be expunged and my pay grade changed.

260
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:34,391
- I need security to station one.
- Security?

261
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,436
What for?

262
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:41,270
I need people whose minds are on their jobs.
Yours isn't.

263
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:45,399
So you're firing me? You can't.
You need me. I'm juggling active protocols.

264
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,674
We'll manage.

265
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:51,117
Please escort Ms Gavin out of the building.
Make sure you get her access card.

266
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,875
You'll be sorry for this.
I promise you will.

267
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,473
- Back entrance locked?
- Yeah.

268
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,949
Put these in each window.
Have ammunition ready.

269
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:42,036
And I want you to get two hunting vests.
Fill all the pockets with empty clips. Go.

270
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:52,591
Ms Gavin won't be working with us any more.
I'll need you two to divide her workload.

271
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:57,800
We're stretched pretty thin. Everyone is up to
their necks, or not qualified to replace Sarah.

272
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:02,158
- You may want to reconsider.
- No. I don't trust her.

273
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:08,516
Then what about Agent Almeida?

274
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:14,914
Michelle, we could use the help,
and he's already proved himself useful today.

275
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:25,315
Agent Almeida, please come to station six.

276
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,675
Yeah.

277
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:39,718
Work with Stiles and Manning
for the rest of the day.

278
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:44,510
Edgar, call up Sarah's protocols. Check
the configuration, make sure they're accurate.

279
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:48,388
- I'll advise internal stations of the change.
Give me an update.

280
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,917
It's quiet except for emergency-vehicle
chatter. There's no sign of Jack or Paul.

281
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:58,154
CTU teams are ready. All we can do is spread
them around the perimeter and wait for Jack.

282
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,629
I think that's a mistake.

283
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,349
We should consolidate our teams,
meet strength with strength.

284
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:07,352
- Where would you place them?
- At McLennan-Forster.

285
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,109
Jack won't be far from there.

286
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,112
Look, he knows we won't be able
to find him without help.

287
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,954
He's gonna help us by starting a firefight.
I know the way he thinks.

288
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:21,318
The hostiles will break radio silence
when they attack. We can follow the signal.

289
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,834
He's gonna engage
an entire team of commandos?

290
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:29,199
It's the most efficient way to be found.
And he's gonna expect us to be ready for it.

291
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,874
Stick with the plan. Cover the perimeter.

292
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,349
Michelle.

293
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:40,834
If we send all our teams to one location and
you're wrong, Jack and Paul won't survive.

294
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:46,229
But if we cover the perimeter,
we may have a chance to save them.

295
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,671
Do it.

296
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,549
Castle, go ahead as planned.
Be ready to move.

297
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,834
There's one of them.

298
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,911
It's time.

299
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,755
No one fires until I give the order.

300
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,229
- OK.
- All right.

301
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,874
Team leader, this is Spectre.
I was just shot at.

302
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,635
I'm on the northwest corner of Stringer,
between Flower and Third.

303
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,709
<i> Copy that. </i>

304
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,437
- He's not returning fire.
- Because he's alone.

305
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,795
He's calling for backup now.

306
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:12,032
- And what do we do?
- Wait for them to come full force.

307
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,873
Just stay ready.

308
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,831
- Audrey.
- Yes?

309
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:24,596
Let DOD know we're using law-enforcement
channels in the blackout zone.

310
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:27,717
- I told them we might need their feeds.
- You don't need them?

311
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,837
- No.
- All right, no problem.

312
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,709
I didn't mean to be confrontational before.

313
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,917
Just, when you walk into a hailstorm
you have to be decisive.

314
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,753
I understand,
and I know where you're coming from.

315
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,913
I think that you're making
the right decisions, but...

316
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,433
But what?

317
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,717
I think that you should
re-evaluate your opinion of Tony.

318
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:56,236
- Why is that?
- This morning Jack had nowhere to turn.

319
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:59,835
He went to the one person
he knew would come through for him - Tony.

320
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:02,309
Tony saved our lives.

321
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,672
- I didn't know.
- We had to spend a couple hours with him.

322
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:14,070
It's true, Tony has a lot of issues,
but he is good at what he does.

323
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:18,756
And I think that we could use him
on a day like today.

324
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:21,400
Fair enough.

325
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,360
And business aside,

326
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:33,034
he still cares about you.

327
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,073
I got those perimeter teams
you asked for ready to go.

328
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,116
Thanks.

329
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:52,637
Tony, look, I just want you to know that just
because I overruled you a few minutes ago

330
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,792
doesn't mean that I don't value your input.

331
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,115
Don't patronise me, Michelle.

332
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,270
I'm not.

333
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:06,791
Look, you ran CTU for two years.

334
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:11,556
Anything that you have to say
I will consider seriously.

335
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:21,876
Don't worry. I'm gonna tell you what I think
whether you want to hear it or not, all right?

336
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,476
Good.

337
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:36,313
You scared?

338
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:40,677
- You sure you both want to do this?
- Yeah.

339
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:44,950
My brother and I are more angry
about these attacks than you are.

340
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:50,512
So we're gonna stand up and we're gonna
try to be part of the solution.

341
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:54,275
- I'm sorry this had to happen in your store.
- Yeah.

342
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:59,319
Our father left us this business
when he died.

343
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:05,077
And he worked his whole life to make
a good name for himself in the community.

344
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,151
This store is his legacy,

345
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,913
but if he were here right now,

346
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:14,233
he'd be standing next to you,

347
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,039
just as we are.

348
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,318
Just stay low and do what I tell you.

349
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,670
Thank you...

350
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,188
for saving my life.

351
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,630
Yeah.

352
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,880
They're here.

353
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:33,190
Tony, Michelle said that you were doing
a search on ties to Marwan. May I help?

354
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:36,078
- Do you have a sign-on for the SYKY server?
- In Washington?

355
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:40,790
- Yeah, it would save me time on this search.
- Yeah.

356
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,634
- There you go.
- Thanks.

357
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:49,679
- Anything else?
- It should kick off a few names.

358
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:54,436
You can help me write them down
once it's done searching.

359
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:01,798
So... did you tell Michelle
what happened today?

360
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:04,838
- I said that Jack called you.
- Anything else?

361
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:09,152
I didn't say that you were living
with anyone, if that's what you mean.

362
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:13,995
She probably already knows that,
and I'm sure she couldn't care less.

363
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:19,473
So how are you and Jack faring
with him out in the field today?

364
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,551
It's different.

365
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:27,191
- A lot different than Washington.
- Yeah.

366
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,430
It is different.

367
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:36,117
To tell the truth, I couldn't believe it when
I heard that Jack had taken a desk job in DC.

368
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:39,033
He said he was happier this way.

369
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,678
Uh-huh.

370
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:46,674
Well, you've gotten a chance
to see him in both worlds today.

371
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,830
Think he'll go back to wearing a suit?

372
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:54,233
After the hell Jack's been through today,
you think he'd want to come back to this?

373
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:57,312
Some people are more comfortable in hell.

374
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:00,278
Are you talking about Jack...

375
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,669
or yourself?

376
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,354
I think we found them.

377
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,832
Each signal is a radio,
all using the same frequency.

378
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,433
They're planning an attack.

379
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:18,115
They're at Flower and Third,
a quarter mile from McLennan-Forster.

380
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:21,795
You were right.
He's actually drawing them in.

381
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,228
Go, go!

382
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:53,793
A sporting goods store, across the street.

383
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,911
Let's move.

384
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,956
Bravo One, move in.

385
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:35,397
The spread's picking up
automatic-weapon fire.

386
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:38,677
- When will our teams get there?
- The ground teams will arrive first.

387
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:41,957
- When?
- At least five or six minutes.

388
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:59,270
- Who's helping them?
- I don't know. They gotta be civilians.

389
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:02,397
We need to end this and get that document.
Understood?

390
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,916
- Yeah, I understand.
- Let's go.

391
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,870
Hey, Naji! Hey!

392
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,996
Hey, are you hit? Hey?

393
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,957
You OK? Naji!

394
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:24,072
It hit the clip.

395
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,439
Naji.

396
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,350
Fall back!

397
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,709
All right! Now! Now!

398
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,754
Move forward!

399
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,311
Hurry! Take my shotgun.

400
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:08,312
Because of their night goggles,
if they get within ten feet,

401
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:12,439
shine your flashlight in their eyes,
it'll blind them.

402
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:47,517
Jack?

403
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,752
The gunfire's stopped.

404
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:53,229
- Are the teams on site?
- Not yet.

405
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:55,754
The commandos could have
taken over the location.

406
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:58,513
They might have taken the information back.

407
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,591
Try to get in touch with our teams.

408
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:03,148
I'll update Division.

409
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:08,951
If McLennan-Forster won the firefight,
what about Jack and Paul?

410
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,474
There's no way to tell.

411
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:30,511
- CTU personnel are approaching the location.
- <i>It's Castle. We're about to engage. </i>

412
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:33,876
- How many hostiles?
- <i>Six down outside. Unknown inside. </i>

413
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:37,589
- Lee, it's Tony. Are Jack and Paul alive?
- <i>Unknown at this point. </i>

414
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:41,798
The hostiles cannot leave
with the information from McLennan-Forster.

415
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,836
- You understand?
- <i>We'll do our best. </i>

416
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:49,199
No. Listen. Failure is not an option. That
information is what this whole thing's about.

417
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,998
<i>Roger that. </i>

418
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:46,313
Jack!
- Yeah? I'm here.

419
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,992
- You safe?
- Yeah.

420
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,799
- All hostiles are down. We're clear.
- OK.

421
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,030
Go ahead.

422
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,871
This way.

423
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,314
- This is Castle. Get me CTU.
- <i> Stand by. </i>

424
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,471
- Curtis.
- <i>It's Castle. </i>

425
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:10,314
- Lee, what's your status?
- Location secured. Jack and Raines are safe.

426
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,597
- What about their information?
- Unknown at this point.

427
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:17,036
Keep this line open.
Jack's OK. The team secured the store.

428
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,997
- What about Paul?
- He's with him.

429
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:23,153
- Has he anything from McLennan-Forster?
- We don't know yet.

430
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:26,152
Stay in touch.
Whatever they get, be ready to work up.

431
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:29,038
You got it.

432
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,189
Yeah?

433
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:36,114
- <i> You want us to help process?</i>
- No. We'll do it when we sift the data.

434
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,316
- <i> Sure that's not a problem?</i>
- Yeah.

435
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:43,155
- <i>All right. We'll wait for your confirmation. </i>
- Yeah. OK.

436
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:46,516
- Jack and Paul are OK.
- What about the information?

437
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:51,754
We don't know. Even if Jack has it, we don't
know that it'll bring us any closer to Marwan.

438
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:54,957
McLennan-Forster's involvement
should yield some leads.

439
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:59,272
That will have to be worked up here. Their
computers were knocked out by the EMP.

440
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,669
You want to head that up?

441
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:07,312
No. You know what?
You should probably let Curtis handle that.

442
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,709
All right, I will.

443
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:17,479
I shouldn't have said that earlier
about your drinking. I was out of line.

444
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,551
I'm sorry.

445
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:24,152
You don't owe me an apology.

446
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,794
My life right now...

447
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:34,916
Let's just say that I've been better.

448
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:39,994
Quite frankly, seeing you here today
has only made things worse.

449
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:48,553
Look, I'm gonna leave, get out of your hair
and let you do your job, all right?

450
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,437
No.

451
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:57,309
We can't afford to lose you.

452
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,470
Not today.

453
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:01,915
You're sure?

454
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,797
Yes.

455
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,468
Yes, I'm sure.

456
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:14,111
All right.

457
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:36,438
I'll make sure you get help
putting the store together.

458
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:39,353
I appreciate that.

459
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,431
Thank you.

460
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,876
Thank you.

461
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:04,035
Lee, I need you to get this to CTU.
It needs to get decoded immediately.

462
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:08,477
Set up a detail, five of your best men.
Nothing happens to this store. Understand?

463
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:11,150
Jack, look out!

464
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,796
Paul?

465
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:22,793
Paul? Paul! Medic!

466
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:26,316
Come on. Just stay with me.
Come on, Paul, stay with me.

467
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,870
No, no. Paul! Paul, stay with me.
Come on, look at me. Look at me.

468
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:32,872
There you go. Look at me.

469
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,593
I owed you.

470
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:38,148
You don't owe me anything.
Just stay with me.

471
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:41,152
Jack, it's OK. The medic's here.

472
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,912
Jack, let the medics do their work.

473
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:11,634
- Any problems?
- No, I'm here.

474
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:14,280
- Are we on schedule?
- Yes.

475
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:16,476
- What about you?
- I'm leaving now.

476
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:22,916
The President of the United States
is on a tight schedule. We can't be late.
