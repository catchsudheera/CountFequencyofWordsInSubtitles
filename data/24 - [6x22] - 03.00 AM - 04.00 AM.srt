1
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,911
You didn'tjust betray me,
you betrayed your country.

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,752
I swear to you, I didn't know.

3
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,831
The Russians know about the component,

4
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,196
and they're threatening military action
if we don't get it back.

5
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:26,475
You're gonna go back to your boyfriend,

6
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,279
make him believe
that we have the component back.

7
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:34,032
When you go back to Mr Bishop, you will find
a way to excuse yourself from the room,

8
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:37,351
to allow him time to access your PDA.

9
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,319
If you can feed all this convincingly to Bishop
he will relay it to his Russian contact.

10
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,995
President Suvarov will call off
his threat of military action.

11
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:48,993
<i>(Miller) I'm always worried
the next crisis is around the corner.</i>

12
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,116
<i>(Bishop) I know how
to take your mind off of it.</i>

13
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,156
Head east 153 metres.

14
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:59,391
That will put you directly beneath CTU.

15
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:03,712
This is Nadia. Code Red is confirmed.
Lock this place down.

16
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,758
Everyone on the floor!

17
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:18,193
- Are you all right?
- Yes. Jack, what do they want with Josh?

18
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,511
<i>- (Jack) What do you mean?
- (Marilyn) They came here to get him.</i>

19
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,876
- I'm not leaving you.
- We're gonna be following you.

20
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,632
Just go. Keep going.

21
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,837
- Put your weapon down on the ground now!
- I'm putting it down.

22
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,154
- The boy's escaped.
- Get the boy back.

23
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,231
I don't care what you have to do!

24
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:38,357
I'm going to give you ten seconds.

25
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:42,433
If you don't show yourself by the time
I've finished counting, she dies.

26
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,957
The operation was successful.
My men have your grandson.

27
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,750
Call me when I can talk to the boy.

28
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,876
Finished repairing the sub-circuit board?

29
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,192
Almost. I'll return it
when you bring me my grandson.

30
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,756
Who is in command?

31
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,115
I am.

32
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,758
Milo Pressman.

33
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,434
I'm acting director of CTU.

34
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,268
Cheng, I'm sending the boy to you now.

35
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,510
<i>(Marilyn) What?</i>

36
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,072
Get him into the tunnel, now.

37
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,435
Josh! Josh, no! Josh!

38
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,475
<i>(Jack) Marilyn!</i>

39
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,870
<i>- What do you want with him?
- (Jack) Marilyn. Marilyn!</i>

40
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,235
Help, please! Please!

41
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,436
They're taking my child! Please!

42
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,350
Leave her alone.

43
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,876
- He's just a boy. He didn't do anything!
- Shut up!

44
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,269
Wait! Please. Please.

45
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,239
I can help you calm her down.
Please, let me just help you.

46
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,753
<i>(Marilyn sobs)</i>

47
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,990
Get on your feet.

48
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:14,277
- Keep her quiet.
- Thank you.

49
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,399
Marilyn.

50
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,232
Marilyn.

51
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:27,199
All of you, listen to me. Pay attention.

52
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,592
We're moving you to a secure room,
then we will leave.

53
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,434
Do what I tell you to do
and no one will be hurt.

54
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,995
Come on.

55
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,717
Come on.

56
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,231
Let's go.

57
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,512
We're moving you in two groups.

58
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,433
<i>- Group one, on your feet.
- (man) Get up.</i>

59
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:22,433
- What are they doing?
- They got what they want.

60
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,590
Now they wanna stop us from following them.

61
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,278
We're gonna try and get Josh back.
I need you to be at the front of our group.

62
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,112
You need to be at the front.

63
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,159
Group two, on your feet.

64
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,231
<i>(Jack) OK, stand up.</i>

65
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,188
Go.

66
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,111
Nadia.

67
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:47,990
If they lock us in the holding room, we'll lose
our chance to get that component back.

68
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,959
- So we have to do something now.
- Yeah. But you need to understand,

69
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:56,670
this is a long shot at best - there's a good
chance we won't make it through this.

70
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,751
I understand.

71
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:08,509
Stay close to me. As soon as I make
my move, take the first man on the left.

72
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,751
- What are you guys talking about?
- Chloe, keep going.

73
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,874
Morris, stay alert.

74
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,150
<i>(shouts in Chinese)</i>

75
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,355
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

76
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,799
Teams B and C, are the hostages secure?

77
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:21,555
<i>(man over radio) Copy. All hostages secure.</i>

78
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:26,278
Cheng's men attacked us.
They were after my nephew.

79
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:30,672
It has something to do with the component -
otherwise, why would they take the risk?

80
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,149
I need a tactical setup and comm,
I'm ready to go.

81
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,151
But you're still under arrest.

82
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:39,597
I know the schematics of this building
better than anyone. I can find them.

83
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,717
- OK. I'll release you, but Doyle's in command.
- Fine.

84
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,712
<i>- Get him whatever he needs.
- (agent) Yes, ma'am.</i>

85
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,837
How many casualties did you sustain?

86
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,878
One. Milo Pressman.

87
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,473
- Are you OK?
- No.

88
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,279
- I'm set. We need to go.
- Use my cell until comm's up.

89
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,237
You did great.

90
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,039
<i>(Doyle) We're on the move. Let's go.</i>

91
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,035
That was really brave.

92
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,635
We need to restore comm and satellite.

93
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,190
There may be more server capacity
in data storage.

94
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,918
Try it.

95
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,471
Keep going.

96
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,951
- Climb up.
- All right.

97
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,753
- Hello, Josh.
- Who are you?

98
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,877
- Start loading. We're moving out.
- What do you want?

99
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,951
<i>(speaks Chinese)</i>

100
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,513
<i>- (Phillip) What took you so long?
- I have the boy with me.</i>

101
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,271
Put him on the phone.

102
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:14,398
Your grandfather wants to speak with you.

103
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,313
- My grandfather?
- Yes.

104
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,391
Take the phone.

105
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,957
Grandpa?

106
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,990
Hello, Joshua.

107
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:32,277
Look, I'm sorry -
I know you've been through a lot.

108
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:36,876
"I'm sorry"? A few hours ago you pointed
a gun at my head and said you'd kill me.

109
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:40,475
- I never would have hurt you.
- I heard you say it!

110
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:45,350
I had to make it sound convincing, to you
and to Jack, or I wouldn't have gotten away.

111
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,112
But I wouldn't hurt you.

112
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,838
Not for anything.

113
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,356
- This way.
- What do you want from me?

114
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,713
- To protect you.
- From what?

115
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,876
From your father's mistakes.

116
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:04,670
If you stay here, they'll never let you
forget what your father did.

117
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:10,756
I'm taking you away from this ungrateful
country - someplace we can both start over.

118
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,832
- Where?
- China.

119
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,835
Within a decade, they will have
surpassed this country in every possible way.

120
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,592
And we can be part of it.

121
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:26,800
I am going to give you the future
I promised you when you were born.

122
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,269
I don't know what you're talking about.

123
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,669
No... I didn't think you would.

124
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,673
<i>But you will.
I'll explain everything when I see you.</i>

125
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,719
Right now, all I need
is for you to keep an open mind.

126
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,074
Let's go.

127
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,074
Wait. I don't wanna be with my grandpa.

128
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,949
- I'm afraid of him.
- He's a visionary.

129
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,600
You should be grateful for the opportunity.

130
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,319
I don't wanna be with him, though!

134

Cheng's using the boy as a shield.
Hold your fire. Hold your fire!

135
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,470
Move! Move!

136
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,752
I've got two hostiles at the SUV.
Cover me now.

00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,591
Mike, I'm on the roof.

158
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:33,877
I lost Cheng, but I've got Josh.
I need to secure him.

159
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:40,237
On our way up now. We're setting up
a perimeter around the building.

160
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,796
Josh, the man that had you,
his name is Cheng.

161
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,758
Did he explain why he tried to take you?

162
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:01,116
No, but he made me
talk on the phone with Grandpa.

163
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,191
- He did?
- Yeah.

164
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:06,352
- You talked to your grandfather?
- Yeah.

165
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,398
- What'd he say?
- He said that he loved me,

166
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,677
that he wanted to take me to China,
and that I was his legacy.

167
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,274
I think he's out of his mind.

168
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,433
Josh, listen to me. I need your help.

169
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:25,959
Was there anything you heard that could
help us figure out where your grandfather is?

170
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,429
- No.
- Josh, think.

171
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:34,869
- I don't know. I'm sorry.
- Josh, hey.

172
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,030
It's all right.

173
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,954
It's all right. Come on,
let's get you back to your mom.

174
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,589
Jack! CTU has a team on the way
to secure the area.

175
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:47,240
Let them know
my father's still involved in this.

176
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:50,710
- He's involved with the Chinese? Why?
- I don't know.

177
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,712
I'll ask him when I find him.

178
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,038
<i>(knock on door)</i>

179
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,672
- Sir?
- Come in, Karen.

180
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:16,548
I just got off the phone with the Pentagon.
The latest intel indicates

181
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:20,872
the Russians are moving two mechanised
divisions into the Central Asian theatre.

182
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:26,592
- Within striking distance of our base?
- Yes. Troops are at the highest level of alert.

183
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:31,319
Tom Lennox was supposed
to be on the call with me.

184
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,312
I couldn't find him
or get him on the telephone.

185
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,597
Is there something that I should know about?

186
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:42,231
Tom is out in the field,
running a classified operation.

187
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,949
He figured out who the leak was.

188
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,190
- Who?
- Lisa Miller.

189
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:53,352
Lisa Miller is spying for the Russians?

190
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,032
No.

191
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:59,959
The man Lisa's romantically involved with is.

192
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:06,718
For the last year, this man, Mark Bishop, has
been passing Lisa's emails to the Russians -

193
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:11,555
along with other things
that she told him in confidence.

194
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:16,191
And that's how the Russians knew
the Chinese had the component?

195
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:20,709
- Does Lisa know?
- She does now.

196
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:26,950
Tom sent her back to this man Bishop
with a cover story and falsified emails

197
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:30,999
that we hope will convince the Russians
that we destroyed the circuit board

198
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:34,709
before the Chinese could get it
out of the country. With any luck,

199
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:40,272
Bishop will forward those emails
to the Russians and they'll back off,

200
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:45,673
and we'll have bought time to actually retrieve
the component from the Chinese.

201
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:50,037
Well, I hope that works, sir.

202
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,518
Karen?

203
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,478
Sit down.

204
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:58,199
You're wondering
why you were kept out of the loop.

205
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:02,159
It had nothing to do with you,
and everything to do with me.

206
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,117
I... I don't understand.

207
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:11,997
At the same time Lisa was with Bishop,
she and I were...

208
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:17,076
in a relationship as well.

209
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,230
Needless to say...

210
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,633
I am ashamed.

211
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:29,272
Well, sir... I think you're being
a little hard on yourself.

212
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,351
You and Lisa were both single.

213
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,750
There was no way you could know
what she was doing behind your back.

214
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:38,833
It's a question ofjudgment. I trusted her.

215
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,952
And unless Tom's plan succeeds,

216
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,078
that mistake will bring us to war.

217
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,111
<i>(gasps of pleasure)</i>

218
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:11,515
And finally, we're done. There we go.

219
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,835
You OK?

220
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:29,428
I'm great. That was great.

221
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,670
It felt like you were somewhere else.

222
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,914
I'm just tired.

223
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,116
It's been a long day.

224
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,151
I'll be right back.

225
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:55,479
Do you think he's just concerned,
or suspicious?

226
00:19:55,560 --> 00:20:00,953
I don't know. But she is leaving him alone
with the PDA - this could be it.

227
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:20,070
Making his move. He's making his move.

228
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:48,192
That must be the device he's using
to forward the emails to the Russians.

229
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:53,672
Gentlemen, he is taking the bait.

230
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,309
Come on.

231
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,151
Come on.

232
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:08,711
Come on, come on, come on.
Send these emails.

233
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:12,713
<i>(agent) He's not going to, sir.
He's putting her PDA away.</i>

234
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,758
Sweetheart, I'm just gonna pour myself
a glass of wine. You want something?

235
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,798
Sure. I'll have what you're having.

236
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,676
No.

237
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:01,036
I don't think it's just that you're tired.

238
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,236
What are you talking about?

239
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,356
The way you were in bed -
something's wrong.

240
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:09,557
- We may have a problem here.
- Everything's fine.

241
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,833
Then why can't you look me in the eye?

242
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:20,278
You're making me nervous,
staring at me like that.

243
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,590
Can we stop talking about this?

244
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:25,672
- I know you. You don't get nervous.
- You're hurting me.

245
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,034
- What's going on?
- Nothing!

246
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,792
- You're lying!
- I'm not!

247
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,233
Tell me!

248
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,751
This is not good.

249
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:42,277
All right, I'll tell you what's going on.
What's going on...

250
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,439
- Get in there quick!
...is you're a lying son of a bitch!

251
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,078
I put myself on the line for you!

252
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:51,915
All you were doing was whoring yourself
to the Russians, stealing my emails...

253
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,836
- Do you realise what you've done?
- Bitch!

254
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:02,312
They'll charge me with treason -
I'll be put in jail!

255
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,311
Agh!

256
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,991
<i>(gasps)</i>

257
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:12,749
Who knows about me and the Russians?
Who knows?

258
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,669
Freeze! Get him off her.

259
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,356
Put Mr Bishop in the bedroom.

260
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:25,228
<i>(agent) She's got a pulse.
It's faint, but she's breathing.</i>

261
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:28,039
Let's get an ambulance here fast.

262
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:40,389
Mr Bishop, I guess you already familiarised
yourself with the White House staff.

263
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:46,675
May I have a moment alone
with the prisoner?

264
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:52,994
We have incontrovertible evidence
you were spying for the Russians.

265
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:56,436
We have recordings of you on the phone
with the agent running you,

266
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:59,398
and now, of course, we've got this.

267
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,394
Do I have your attention?

268
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:06,040
All right. So here it is.

269
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:11,353
You are going to
upload the emails on Ms Miller's PDA

270
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,512
to your Russian employers.

271
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:17,672
Additionally,
you are going to call your handler

272
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,955
and back up the story these emails tell -

273
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:24,955
namely that our country destroyed the
circuit board before it fell into Chinese hands.

274
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:28,953
Now, if you comply,
we'll push for leniency in your sentencing.

275
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:33,591
If you do not,
I can all but guarantee you the death penalty.

276
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,471
<i>(phone rings)</i>

277
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:48,040
<i>- What is it, Cheng?
- I lost the boy.</i>

278
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,839
<i>- Who has him?
- CTU and your son.</i>

279
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:56,472
This is totally unacceptable. The boy
was my price for repairing the circuit board.

280
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:59,870
I lost many men
trying to give you your price, Mr Bauer.

281
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:06,074
I really don't give a damn
about your operational incapacities.

282
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:10,517
- Our arrangement is over.
- It cannot be over. You have our component.

283
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:15,720
You failed to hold up your end of the deal.
The circuit board is no longer yours.

284
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:20,032
Repair the circuit board and return it to us,
or there'll be serious consequences!

285
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,916
You listen to me. I'm not afraid of you, Cheng.

286
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:31,592
And the next time you threaten me, the
consequences will be serious - but not for me.

287
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,871
<i>(speaks Chinese)</i>

288
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:52,033
- Any luck?
- No.

289
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,873
Have our teams located Cheng
or the sub-circuit board?

290
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,633
- Nothing yet.
- What's the status on our satellite?

291
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:00,473
We rerouted circuits
through an undamaged subsystem.

292
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:04,872
- The grid should be back up in ten minutes.
- Try to make it five.

293
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,758
- Nadia Yassir?
- Yeah. Can I help you?

294
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,195
My name is Ben Kram.
I'm from Division.

295
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:13,590
You should have received a memo
alerting you of my arrival.

296
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:17,514
- Our systems are still down.
- That's exactly why I'm here.

297
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:21,513
I've been authorised to compile
an assessment of your security breach.

298
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:25,559
We're right in the middle
of a recovery operation, and it's 3am -

299
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:28,950
this isn't the best time
to be questioning my people.

300
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,838
Frankly, I don't particularly care
what you think.

301
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:36,869
- Excuse me?
- This represents a serious breach in security.

302
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,396
One that resulted in
the loss of a number of CTU personnel.

303
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,314
Obviously mistakes were made,
errors in judgment -

304
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,233
like my accepting
Bill Buchanan's recommendation

305
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:50,517
to leave someone with
your limited experience in charge.

306
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:55,116
So, can I count on
your full cooperation or not?

307
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:59,233
- I never said otherwise.
- Super.

308
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,877
I'll need a full staff roster
and access to all departments,

309
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,794
plus some kind of a station
to set up my investigation.

310
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,553
You can work out of
that conference room there.

311
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,631
Thank you.

313
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,073
There is a group from Division here
in conference room B.

314
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:31,188
<i>- Please give them whatever they need.
- Yes, ma'am. We'll take care of it.</i>

315
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,559
- Nadia.
- Yeah, Morris?

316
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:43,270
This may not be my place, but don't let
those buggers from Division get to you.

317
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:49,230
- You're not responsible for what happened.
- Of course I am. It happened on my watch.

318
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:54,030
There's nothing you could have done.
Do not let them hang you out to dry.

319
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:58,272
People are dead.
Milo is dead because of me.

320
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:01,796
That's ridiculous.
There's nothing anyone could have done.

321
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:06,112
No, I... I could have stood up.
I could have said something.

322
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:09,397
There was no time. Milo jumped in.

323
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,395
There was time.

324
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,875
I just hesitated.

325
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,432
- I was just...
- You were just afraid?

326
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:29,036
Yeah, I have a bit of experience with that.

327
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:32,954
I'm not one to advise on how to handle
self-recrimination, but I know this -

328
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:36,555
Milo was a brave man.
He never would have sacrificed himself

329
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:41,430
if he knew you'd allow others
to lay his death at your feet.

330
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,792
He'd want you to stay strong,

331
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:48,075
stay in charge.

332
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,956
<i>- (intercom beeps)
- (Melinda) Sir, Tom Lennox is on the line.</i>

333
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,837
Thanks.

334
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,519
Tom. I'm with Karen.

335
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:13,755
That information we planted for the Russians,
that has been sent on to Bishop's contact.

336
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,752
Good. Do you think
it's made its way to Suvarov yet?

337
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:21,550
I'm confident it has. But I do think a call to
the Russian president, giving him the news,

338
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:24,598
that might well strengthen
the credibility of our story.

339
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,796
I agree.

340
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,714
- Tom, thanks.
- Sir, there is one other thing.

341
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:34,475
- What's that?
- We had some complications, and, uh...

342
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:37,677
Lisa was injured in the operation.

343
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:42,715
- How badly?
- She had a loss of oxygen to the brain.

344
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,712
We won't know
till she regains consciousness.

345
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:49,236
- She is on her way to hospital.
- How the hell did this happen?

346
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:55,714
She attacked Bishop. Before we could even
get in there, he almost strangled her to death.

347
00:29:55,800 --> 00:30:00,396
And what were you doing during all this?
Where was Secret Service?

348
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,596
Sir, we did everything we could.

349
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:05,831
Itjust happened too fast.

350
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,956
All right, thank you, Tom.

351
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:11,237
<i>All right. I'll be back there shortly.</i>

352
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,831
I'm so sorry, sir.

353
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:24,876
I know that, despite her betrayal,
you still have feelings for Lisa.

354
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:29,598
Unfortunately, we do have
a pressing matter to address.

355
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,153
<i>(sighs)</i>

tell him that the Chinese no longer have the
component, and that it has been destroyed.

Marilyn, the Chinese
were doing this for my father.

- They were trying to get Josh to him.
- You sure?

371
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:33,908
- Yeah. Josh spoke to him.
- What did he tell Josh?

372
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,675
He said he wanted to take him back to China,
that Josh was his legacy.

That's it? That's all he said?

Yeah.

375
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:46,273

Come on. We need to go.

Sir, President Suvarov is standing by for you.

Whenever you're ready.

391
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,156
Let's do this.

392
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:02,877
President Suvarov, you have a secure
conference with Vice President Daniels.

393
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,872
Mr President,
I have some good news to share with you.

394
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:08,474
<i>What is this good news, Mr Vice President?</i>

395
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:11,677
We were successful
in taking out the Chinese agents

396
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:15,196
attempting to smuggle
the FB-sub-circuit board out of the country.

397
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:18,158
<i>You have the component
back in your possession?</i>

398
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,071
No, sir.

399
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:23,436
The sub-circuit board was destroyed
when we attacked the Chinese.

400
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:27,069
<i>I see. I assume you have proof of this.</i>

401
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,310
Yes, we do.

402
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:32,358
In addition to fragments
from the destroyed component,

403
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:35,273
I'll give you whatever images
or documentation you need

404
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:39,638
to assure you
that this threat's been neutralised.

405
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:45,390
<i>Do you mean the same documentation
you planted with one of my agents?</i>

406
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,716
<i>- Excuse me?
- The same images</i>

407
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:54,997
<i>you coerced him into sending to my people</i>

408
00:33:55,080 --> 00:34:00,518
<i>of a strike that accomplished nothing
but destroying an empty building?</i>

409
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:03,558
<i>Yes, I know you exposed
one of my operatives.</i>

410
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:08,475
<i>I had him under surveillance, which is how
I know about your raid on his apartment.</i>

411
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,994
<i>- Mr President...
- If the Chinese agent</i>

412
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:15,517
<i>in possession of the sub-circuit board
is allowed to transfer it to his government,</i>

413
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:19,434
<i>the entire Russian defence system
will be compromised.</i>

414
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,990
<i>I told you I would hold you
and your government responsible.</i>

415
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:26,277
I will not tolerate any threats
from you, Mr President.

416
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:30,478
We're doing everything in our power to
ensure the component doesn't reach China.

417
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:33,791
<i>I have already given you
ample time to recover it.</i>

418
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:36,952
<i>Now I am feeling less generous.</i>

419
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:42,111
<i>If you do not deliver concrete
and irrefutable proof to our embassy</i>

420
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:46,193
<i>that you have recovered or destroyed
this component within two hours,</i>

421
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:50,319
<i>I will have no choice but to extend
my country's forward perimeter,</i>

422
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:53,551
<i>to compensate
for our defensive vulnerabilities.</i>

423
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:58,388
You are talking about attacking
one of our military bases,

424
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:03,110
and I would urge you
to consider the consequences of that.

425
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,589
We have just as many troops in that area,

426
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:10,913
and allies will not look kindly upon
any unprovoked aggression on my country.

427
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,276
<i>You and I both know it will not be unprovoked.</i>

428
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:17,079
<i>This is a matter of survival for us.</i>

429
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:21,669
<i>It is in both our interests
that you get that component back.</i>

430
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:25,517
<i>You have two hours.</i>

431
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:33,989
- It was all for nothing.
- Excuse me, sir?

432
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,749
This ruse, it bought us nothing.

433
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:41,717
We're about to go to war
over a piece of circuitry.

434
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,120
The agenda for the briefing with the military.

435
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,476

The Russians are blaming us for allowing
the theft, and are preparing to retaliate.

441
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:23,433
Our efforts to reacquire
the component have failed,

442
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,988
so we have no choice
but to defend ourselves,

443
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:31,279
and to make provisions for the escalation of
this conflict beyond the Central Asian theatre.

- Dunno. But he's in league with the Chinese.

I want my grandson.

456
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:27,478
And I want clear passage
to the country of my choice.

457
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:32,315
Give me that,
and I'll give you the FB-sub-circuit board.

458
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,472
You're working with the Chinese.

459
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,551
I was.

460
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,595
They had their chance, they blew it.

461
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,956
How do I know
you even have this component?

462
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:50,599
Serial number: 3-P-T-L-3.

463
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,957
<i>Check it against any records you have.</i>

464
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:01,598
<i>- (Lennox) Yeah, there it is, sir.
- You realise what you're asking?</i>

465
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:05,992
I'm offering you the opportunity of avoiding
a conflict this country does not want.

466
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:09,390
A war this country cannot afford.

467
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,835
Not after what's happened today.

468
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:15,356
<i>I'll send my instructions
on an encrypted data stream.</i>

469
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,829
<i>- Mr Bauer?
- (hangs up)</i>

470
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,117
Sir, you are not seriously considering this?

471
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:25,317
Phillip Bauer is a federal fugitive,

472
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:28,597
complicit in selling
nuclear weapons to terrorists.

473
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:32,468
- I know what crimes he's committed.
- Then how can you negotiate with him?

474
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:37,315
- Cos maybe we can't afford not to.
- You'd trade the life of an innocent boy?

475
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:40,517
It'd be the lives of a lot more men
if we go to war with Russia.

476
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:43,672
And you think Phillip Bauer
is somebody that we can trust?

477
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:46,433
The man is a sociopath!

478
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:50,756
Tom?

479
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:53,798
He is a sociopath. She's right about that.

480
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:59,637
But given the stakes,
this is a risk worth taking, sir.

481
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,915
None of this makes sense.

482
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,835
Suvarov wouldn't risk military engagement,
even for this piece of technology.

483
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:12,037
- Unless he's being squeezed.
- Who by? His cabinet?

484
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:14,156
No. The military.

485
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:17,835
Gredenko was not the only
anti-American general in the Soviet regime.

486
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:22,630
Yes, some of them are still in power,
and Suvarov does rely on them.

487
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:26,554
You think these generals are just
looking for an excuse to pull the trigger.

488
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:29,598
Certainly sounds plausible, sir.

489
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:33,389
Well, if that is the case,
then we have no choice.

490
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:37,393
We have to recover that stolen circuit board.

491
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,471
Get me CTU.

492
00:39:57,080 --> 00:40:02,200
As soon as we get back to CTU, you and your
mother will be transported to a safe location.

493
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:06,159
- How long will we be there?
- Until we find your grandfather.

494
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:09,437
When you find him,
what are you gonna do to him?

495
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:12,713
Josh, I don't want you worrying about this.

496
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,439
He will never threaten you
or your mother again.

497
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:18,432
Agent Bauer. It's a call for you. It's urgent.

498
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:21,114
Get in the car. I'll be right there.

499
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:26,029
- You need to come with me.
- What do you mean?

500
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:28,111
Come now!

501
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,031
- Uncle Jack!
- Agent Doyle!

502
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,357
- Uncle Jack!
- Agent Doyle!

503
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:34,908
Orders, Jack. Go back to CTU.

504
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,991
The boy stays with me!

505
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:39,719
Get outta my way!

506
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:42,394
<i>- (agent) Hold him back!
- What are you doing?</i>

507
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,313
- Uncle Jack!
- Take him to CTU.

508
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:48,949
<i>- Uncle Jack!
- (agent) Hold him back. Restrain him.</i>

509
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,669
Josh!

510
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,759
<i>(inaudible)</i>

511
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,031
