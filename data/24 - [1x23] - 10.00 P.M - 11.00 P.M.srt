1
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:18,440
Right now, terrorists are plotting
to assassinate a presidential candidate.

2
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,240
My wife and daughter have been targeted.

3
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:25,480
And people that I work with
may be involved in both.

4
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:30,960
I'm Federal Agent Jack Bauer,
and today is the longest day of my life.

5
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,280
You and Sherry
were childhood sweethearts?

6
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,680
- That's right.
- There's never been anyone else?

7
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,280
I'm running for president. I can't answer that.

8
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,200
- Come on.
- Are you flirting with me, Patty?

9
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,280
I don't know. I think I might be.

10
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,880
- I did what you told me.
- And?

11
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,360
I think it's working. But it's gonna
lead to other things, Mrs. Palmer.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,120
- Teri, I'm busy. Nina can talk to you.
- You are not gonna let my husband die!

13
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,560
No one is gonna let Jack die.
We just can't go through with the trade.

14
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:04,920
There's no difference.
Without your help he doesn't have a chance.

15
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:10,080
I am willing to trade the life
of Jack Bauer for that of my son.

16
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,880
OK, we're here. Here's Alexis. Where's Jack?

17
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,880
Drop the weapon!

18
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:22,200
You son of a bitch!

19
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,360
If your people deliver my brother
as promised, you'll live.

20
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:30,840
- What about my daughter?
- You'll hear from us when this is over.

21
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,360
Yeah!

22
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,840
South of the platform there's a car.

23
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:44,920
If you want to see Kim alive, talk to no one,
get into it, and head toward Century City.

24
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,560
Yeah.

25
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,400
- Proceed to Palmer's hotel.
- What do you want me to do?

26
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,400
When your government abducted my father,
they also froze $200 million of our assets.

27
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,480
Palmer has the necessary
clearance to unfreeze them.

28
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,520
So everything that happened today
was because of money?

29
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,400
I wouldn't say that. That money is ours.

30
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,280
We'll call Palmer
at this number at exactly 10.45.

31
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:47,480
Once I receive confirmation of the transfer,
I'll give you further instructions.

32
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,960
What kind of instructions?

33
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,880
- You want me to take out Palmer.
- Well, of course.

34
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,560
That's why we let you go.

35
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,440
That's why we have your daughter.

36
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:08,120
- Jack?
- I'm still here.

37
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,920
Remember, we'll call at exactly 10.45.

38
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I trust I don't have to tell you what will
happen if Palmer doesn't answer.

39
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,280
- Hello, Patty.
- You left the party early.

40
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,520
I wasn't in the mood. What's up?

41
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,760
I was just wondering if you had a chance
to look at the Dallas schedule.

42
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,240
- It's fine.
- Good.

43
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,840
Um, do you need anything else from me?

44
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,320
Sit down.

45
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:17,320
A little while ago, we started down a road
that was gonna take us to a dangerous place.

46
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,560
I know. And I'm sorry.

47
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,520
Are you?

48
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,320
Sorry?

49
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:32,560
I'm attracted to you, Senator.
I always have been.

50
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,240
Meet me in 20 minutes in room 907.

51
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,240
I'll be waiting for you.

52
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,720
Oh, David, good. I...

53
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:00,360
I, uh... need to talk to you for a second.

54
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:04,920
- I'll just make those changes to the schedule.
- Thanks, Patty.

55
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:16,680
I, uh... told Keith and Nicole

56
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:21,000
that we're going to stump it separately
for the next couple of days.

57
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,640
What did they say?

58
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:28,440
- They know we're not getting along, David.
- Fine. What are they going to do?

59
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:33,000
They'll stay with me.
Unless, of course, you want them with you.

60
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,800
No. I could use a couple of days alone.

61
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,080
Great.

62
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,960
We gotta work under
a couple of assumptions here.

63
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,400
The only way to find Jack is through Drazen.

64
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,920
The only way to get to Drazen
is if Alexis takes us there.

65
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
So we gotta devote all of
our resources to finding Alexis.

66
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,160
- Yeah, but he shed the trackers.
- I know.

67
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:25,000
So we use the satellite
and run computer simulators.

68
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,320
- Yeah?
- George, it's me.

69
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,480
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. Drazen let me go.

70
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,160
- But I can't come in yet.
- What do you mean?

71
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:40,480
George, listen. Tell Teri I'm out.
I know she's worried about me.

72
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,320
If Drazen calls, don't tell him that we talked.
It'll put Kim in danger.

73
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,200
- Fine. But, Jack, let us help you.
- George, I gotta go.

74
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,960
I don't like the sound of that.

75
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,640
- What do you think he's doing?
- If Drazen let him go for a reason...

76
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:03,560
Jack won't let us help him,
he won't tell us what he's doing...

77
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:07,720
Whatever he's doing,
he's trying to protect Kim.

78
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,640
What's the one thing we know
for sure that Drazen wants?

79
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,720
Palmer dead.

80
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:23,720
Jane, connect me with the Palmer suite,
Secret Service.

81
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,800
What's happening?

82
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:58,040
- I can't stop the internal bleeding.
- Do not let him die!

83
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,200
Father...

84
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,600
Alexie!

85
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,200
Do something!

86
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:30,800
I'm sorry. There's nothing more I can do.

87
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,280
No. Leave us. We're family.

88
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,280
First Mother and Martina...

89
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,200
Now Alexis.

90
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:10,440
- And it's Bauer!
- Andre, not yet! We still need her!

91
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,400
- Call him. Let him hear her die!
- Andre!

92
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,760
Uh, could you wait for me, please?

93
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,440
Thanks.

94
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,520
- Well?
- He wants to see me.

95
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,240
- When?
- Tonight.

96
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,600
He didn't waste much time, huh?

97
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,600
How are you doing?

98
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:09,320
- I told you, I feel really uncomfortable...
- No, no, Patty, please. Don't patronise me.

99
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:14,040
You feel uncomfortable, but not because
you're ready to be with my husband.

100
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:19,400
You feel uncomfortable because you're
doing it with my knowledge and consent.

101
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,280
Why are you doing this, Mrs. Palmer?

102
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,960
It's... It's important for David's career
that I have his full confidence.

103
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,200
And I no longer have that.

104
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,880
And you want me to get it?

105
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,440
Yes. And report back to me.

106
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:47,880
- We both know what it's going to...?
- Yes. We do.

107
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:53,640
- And you're OK with that?
- No, I never said I was OK with it.

108
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:58,600
But I'm willing to accept it...
because it's necessary.

109
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,640
Your elevator's waiting.

110
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:16,160
Just make sure that Palmer
has an extra layer of security.

111
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,880
- It's gonna be a little difficult...
- Yes, I know.

112
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,640
Nina, got a minute?

113
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,080
- Hold on.
- This is important.

114
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:26,960
Paul, we're done. OK. What?

115
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,000
The schematics to the detention facility
where they were holding Victor Drazen.

116
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,480
They've been tampered with.

117
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,600
- Who has access to these archives?
- Division and District.

118
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,600
Can you find out who's had access
to these in the last month?

119
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:44,160
- Yeah.
- Well, do it. The sooner the better.

120
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,960
- You think this is a second dirty agent?
- Yeah.

121
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,720
What did Tony want?

122
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,280
He was just telling me why it was
so hard to pick up a thread on Drazen.

123
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,680
Listen, I need your help.
Teri Bauer's a basket case.

124
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:08,680
- I don't know what you think I can do.
- You're good with her. You calm her down.

125
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:12,520
Come on! I gotta deal with Chapelle,
DOD's still trying to pass the buck...

126
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,400
All right.

127
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,480
She's in the conference room.

128
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,560
I know.

129
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:29,080
- Is it over? Did they make the trade?
- Jack's safe. He's no longer a hostage.

130
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,560
Is he on his way?

131
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:34,320
- We don't know where he is.
- What?

132
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:37,880
He called in to tell us he was OK,
but he didn't say anything else.

133
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:41,480
- Why not?
- Drazen wants him to do something else.

134
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:45,120
That doesn't make any sense.
Why would he do anything for that man?

135
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:48,960
- I think it's to protect Kim.
- What are you talking about?

136
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,640
Teri, the reason that Kim isn't back...

137
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,200
- Oh, no, no, no.
- Just listen to me.

138
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:59,000
We think that's where Jack is now.
He's trying to bring Kim back.

139
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:02,880
He's not communicating with us...
to protect her.

140
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,080
I'm sorry.

141
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:01,000
The task we have given your father
is a simple one.

142
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
And if he does it...

143
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,520
will you let me go?

144
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,520
We will see.

145
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,760
- Jack, I just got your message.
- Senator, I need to see you right away.

146
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,720
- Your office said you might be coming.
- I am coming there.

147
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:41,000
- Why?
- I have a message from Victor Drazen.

148
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:44,600
They also said that Drazen has your daughter,
and you could be a threat.

149
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:49,400
They've added to my security. Secret Service
has been instructed not to let you near me.

150
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:54,200
They do have my daughter, but I'm not
coming there to harm you in any way.

151
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,560
- What does Drazen want you to do?
- He wants to speak to you at 10.45.

152
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:02,080
It's a scrambled phone
so that it can't be traced.

153
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,600
- What does he want to talk about?
- Money. I'll explain when I get there.

154
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,600
Just tell your people to let me through.

155
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:12,000
Drazen's people, who are holding
your daughter hostage, want me dead.

156
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,800
You're asking a lot, Jack.

157
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:17,800
They had my wife and daughter today,
and I still managed to save your life.

158
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:22,080
I'm not coming there to harm you in any way.
I give you my word, sir.

159
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,440
Hi.

160
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,560
Anyone see you come up?

161
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,840
No, I was careful.

162
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,200
Why don't you sit down?

163
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,680
Well, how much time do we have?

164
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,280
Don't worry about that.

165
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,600
I have something I wanna tell you, Patty.

166
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,160
Yes?

167
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,560
You're fired.

168
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,400
Pack up. Get out.

169
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,240
And don't bother to ask me
or anyone else on my staff for a reference.

170
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,000
Prospective employers
won't like what I have to say.

171
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:50,560
- I don't understand.
- I know what you're doing.

172
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,480
You're working with my wife against me.

173
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:59,040
Senator, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to deceive you like this.

174
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,040
But your wife insisted
and I didn't know what to say.

175
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:06,160
- "No" would have done it.
- I know, I know. I should have.

176
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:11,200
- It's just that... she can be scary sometimes.
- So can I.

177
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:16,200
Obviously I have made a terrible mistake in
judgment, and if there's anything I can do...

178
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:19,280
I want you out of this hotel in 30 minutes.

179
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:44,760
You gotta take a look at this. These six people
have accessed the detention-facility archives.

180
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:49,240
The first five were just doing
scheduled backups. Here's the sixth.

181
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,520
George?

182
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,680
George is the mole?

183
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:01,760
It's possible. He accessed
that file four days ago.

184
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,320
Why would he have done that
if he wasn't involved?

185
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,360
- You gotta call Chapelle.
- No, shut down his network access.

186
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,160
You can't let anything go in or out.

187
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,440
OK. I just gotta figure out
how I'm gonna do it.

188
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:37,320
- Where were you?
- Downstairs.

189
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,520
- Downstairs?
- Yeah.

190
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,640
In room 907... with Patty.

191
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,160
What?

192
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,920
Save your energy, Sherry.
No need to act surprised.

193
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,360
I fired her.

194
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,080
You know your problem, David?

195
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:15,240
You think everyone's conspiring against you,
when in fact we're just trying to help.

196
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:20,440
By putting another woman in my bed?
Do you realise how sick that is?

197
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:26,680
Oh, come on. We chose a certain life,
and we chose that a long time ago.

198
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:30,400
It's not about a house in the suburbs
and PTA meetings.

199
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,320
And whether you're willing to accept it or not,
we serve a higher purpose.

200
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,600
You are not qualified
to talk about higher purposes.

201
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,440
- Oh, I'm not?
- No, you're not.

202
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:47,200
We are about to move into the White House.

203
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,600
That's right. We.

204
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,920
You and I.

205
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,080
And all the issues, all the politics,

206
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,640
all the hard work
that's gonna help get us there...

207
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:03,160
I'm as much a part of that as you.

208
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,240
So don't even try to deny it.

209
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:09,240
Please, Sherry... don't go there.

210
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:14,240
I'm not begrudging a single thing, David.
I don't need the limelight.

211
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,920
- You sent her to spy on me!
- That's right! And do you wanna know why?

212
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,760
- Yes, I do.
- Because you need me to look out for you.

213
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:26,680
And if you cut me out of your inner circle,
like you threatened earlier today, you will fail.

214
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,160
In every way.

215
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,840
You need me, David.

216
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:33,120
What?

217
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:37,600
- Jack Bauer just arrived, sir.
- I'll be out in a moment.

218
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,280
We're not done here.

219
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,360
- Jack.
- Senator.

220
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:09,680
Convincing Secret Service to let you
come up to see me was difficult enough.

221
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,080
- They won't let me out of their sight.
- That's fine. All that matters

222
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:17,800
is that you talk to Victor Drazen when he
calls, listen to his demands and cooperate.

223
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,000
How did they get your daughter?

224
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,120
Senator, we don't have much time.
He could call any second.

225
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,360
- OK, you said this was about money?
- Yes.

226
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,000
$200 million of his was frozen
after he was abducted.

227
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,400
- And?
- He wants it.

228
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:35,080
He says you have the clearance to get it back.
He'll give you instructions when he calls.

229
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,760
That's why he sent you?
To get me to release his funds?

230
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:43,440
Once he has confirmation of the transfer,
he'll ask me to take action against you.

231
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,560
- To kill me?
- Yes.

232
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:50,920
Of course, I would never do you any harm.
He has my daughter. I'm trying to buy time.

233
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,560
Jack, I don't have the authority to transfer
those funds, and Drazen knows that.

234
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:59,720
- What do you mean?
- He knows our system. That money's gone.

235
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,200
I don't think that's the reason he's calling.

236
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,880
Senator, please, answer this phone.

237
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:26,560
OK, Jack. I'll do what I can.
I'll tell him what he wants to hear.

238
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,240
- I can't guarantee he'll buy it.
- Thank you.

239
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:35,600
- This is David Palmer.
- Senator Palmer.

240
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:39,560
It must be nice being reunited
with your friend Jack Bauer.

241
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:42,080
What do you want?

242
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,240
Drazen? Drazen?

243
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,720
He knows you can't get the money. Senator...

244
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,000
No!

245
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,800
Are you all right, sir?

246
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:30,600
A detonation of this magnitude
had to be military plastique.

247
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:34,680
- Get a powder residue. We'll try and trace it.
- Yes, sir.

248
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,960
- Where is he? David!
- Ma'am, this area's not...

249
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,280
Let her through. It's OK. Calm down.

250
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:51,680
- Where's Keith and Nicole?
- At the party. Are you all right?

251
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,440
- I'm fine.
- Oh, God.

252
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,680
Senator.

253
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:58,120
This is Jack Bauer from CTU,
the man who saved my life twice today.

254
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:01,040
- Mrs. Palmer.
- The man that put your life in danger?

255
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,960
- Sherry, please!
- Status report on the senator?

256
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:08,800
Don't answer that yet. Senator,
we need to talk about this. My daughter...

257
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,080
Tell them you don't know yet.

258
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:14,200
This is Ron.
We don't have a 20 on the senator yet.

259
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,720
What's going on?

260
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:20,120
The man that planned this explosion
needs to believe that it was a success.

261
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,960
Wait a minute. You mean, you want
the world to think that David is dead?

262
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,560
- Yes, ma'am.
- Absolutely not.

263
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,320
David, what's this all about?

264
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:33,720
His daughter is being held hostage.

265
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:38,040
But we can't have people thinking
David was assassinated. It's preposterous!

266
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:42,200
- If we don't, ma'am, my daughter will die.
- Then what do you suggest we do, Mr. Bauer?

267
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,600
We keep the senator quarantined
for a few hours.

268
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:47,760
We leak a story to the press
that he was killed in the explosion.

269
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:52,120
- You've got to be kidding.
- I've never been more serious in my life.

270
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:05,760
- No, it's not gonna happen. David, tell him.
- This is about the life of an innocent girl.

271
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:10,040
David, we cannot keep playing games
with the public and expect to keep their trust.

272
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:13,480
Senator, if we're gonna do this,
we need to do this now.

273
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:24,040
Go downstairs. Bring the children up.
Talk to no one. I mean it.

274
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,440
I need all the agents
that have seen the senator.

275
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:31,120
- Who is your senior chief of staff?
- Mike Novick.

276
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,280
Bring in Mr. Novick as well.

277
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:39,160
As soon as Mr. Palmer's family gets here, no
one is to enter or exit this area. Understood?

278
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,640
Now, Sherry!

279
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,040
- I'm very sorry.
- Don't worry about it.

280
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:52,120
- Are you sure this is gonna work?
- It has to.

281
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:01,200
Hey, Almeida. What's going on
with my network access?

282
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:05,920
- What do you mean?
- I can't access archives or Palmer's itinerary.

283
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,800
- I'll call ITS.
- I don't have time for that. Are you up?

284
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,880
- Yeah, I think so.
- Let's see.

285
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,280
Yeah, here it is.

286
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,760
So Palmer's still going to Dallas tomorrow.

287
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:19,800
Call Secret Service and find out
what time his plane leaves.

288
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:23,040
- Division's got it covered. I don't think...
- Hey, real simple.

289
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:27,120
Call Secret Service.
Find out what time his plane leaves.

290
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,320
And get my network up and running.

291
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,880
- What happened?
- Well, he found out he's cut off.

292
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:47,040
And he seems overly interested in
what happens to Palmer after he leaves LA.

293
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:51,120
- We should alert Chapelle.
- No, not yet.

294
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,280
If we go to Chapelle without evidence,
he'll slice us up.

295
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:58,080
- What about his access?
- I'm gonna have to restore it.

296
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:01,200
All right, but monitor everything
and send it to me.

297
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,680
Put it up on all the monitors!

298
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,960
Everybody, eyes on monitors.

299
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:11,680
Events are unfolding by the minute
in this tragic and stunning development.

300
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:17,080
The hotel has been sealed off. Only a limited
number of personnel are allowed inside.

301
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:20,000
We have heard from a spokesperson
from the Palmer camp,

302
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:24,960
who has just confirmed that Senator David
Palmer has been killed in an explosion.

303
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:28,960
There is speculation this is related
to this morning's assassination attempt,

304
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:32,160
but at this time no one has been arrested.

305
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:36,520
We did it, father. We did it.

306
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,800
Ah, yes.

307
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,160
All right. I'll take care of the girl,
then we can leave.

308
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:47,440
Do not do anything until we know
that Jack Bauer is dead. Do nothing.

309
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:05,160
Sir, we just contacted Mike Novick.
He's on his way.

310
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,440
Agent Bauer, it's for you.

311
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,560
Thank you.

312
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:14,840
- Yeah?
- You're a very lucky man, Mr. Bauer.

313
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:19,520
I was calling to confirm your death,
but I see you've survived.

314
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,720
Andre.

315
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,800
I have an offer to make you.

316
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:27,200
You've killed Senator Palmer.
I'm the last person on your list.

317
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,880
I'll make you a trade: Me for my daughter.

318
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:35,520
Come to Port of Los Angeles. Dock 11A.

319
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,680
What assurances do I have
that you'll let her go when I arrive?

320
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:44,960
Sadly, none. But we've decided the sins
of the father need not be visited upon her.

321
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:48,840
Port of Los Angeles. Dock 11A.
I'll be there in 30 minutes.

322
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:54,960
And, Jack, if you bring your colleagues
or involve them in any way, we'll know.

323
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,760
I understand.

324
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,720
I have to go alone.

325
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,280
- Good luck.
- Thank you, sir.

326
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,880
Why are you doing this to us?

327
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:24,480
Yeah, Jack, I can tell him,
but you should really let us help you on this.

328
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,080
No, I can't, not yet.

329
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,680
Give us a general position,
so we can be nearby.

330
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:34,720
No. If Drazen's got someone else working
on the inside, it could put Kim in danger.

331
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,840
All right.

332
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:38,400
- Let me speak to Teri.
- OK.

333
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,120
It's Jack.

334
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,000
- Jack?
- How are you holdin' up?

335
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:51,800
- Where are you? Do you know about Kim?
- Yes. I'm on my way to pick her up. She's fine.

336
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:54,240
- Where is she?
- I can't say now, sweetheart.

337
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:57,000
But I promise you,
soon she's going to be with you.

338
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:00,760
Thank God. What do you mean "she"?
What about you?

339
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:04,760
- I'm sorry. I meant to say both of us.
- Oh, good.

340
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:09,880
I just don't think I can take much more of this.
I need you both here, Jack.

341
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:13,840
I know, sweetheart. Look, it's almost over.
Just hang in there, OK?

342
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,720
OK.

343
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,200
- Teri?
- What?

344
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:25,000
- I love you.
- I love you too, Jack.

345
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,240
Honey, um...

346
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:33,120
There's something I have to tell you.

347
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,800
- I've been waiting for the right time.
- What is it?

348
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,800
You're gonna be a father.

349
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,680
Again.

350
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:46,200
What are you saying, that you're pregnant?

351
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:49,680
Well, yes, that's generally how it works, Jack.

352
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,960
- Jack?
- I'm still here.

353
00:30:56,160 --> 00:31:00,120
I'm sorry, it was the last thing
I thought you were gonna say.

354
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:03,000
Are you all right with this?
Are you happy about this?

355
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:05,280
Oh, yes. I am.

356
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:13,400
I keep thinking that... maybe it's the
second chance we've been talking about.

357
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,200
Are you there?

358
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:23,160
- Yeah, I'm still here.
- Are you happy about it?

359
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:26,960
Yes. Yes, I'm happy about it.

360
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:29,080
I'm very, very happy.

361
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,840
Good. Are you sure everything's OK?

362
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,600
Yeah.

363
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:42,880
Sweetheart... I promise you
everything is gonna be OK.

364
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:48,320
It's just been a really, really long day.

365
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:54,960
Just get on back here
so we can all go home, OK?

366
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,840
OK.

367
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:00,360
Teri... I love you so much.

368
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,000
I love you too, Jack. I'll see you soon.

369
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,880
I had a sister once.

370
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,800
She was full of life... like you.

371
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:00,880
She was a photographer
and took hundreds of pictures.

372
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,960
I used to love looking at them.

373
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Now I can't do that any more.

374
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:13,040
You know how she died?

375
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,120
Has anyone told you?

376
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,840
Your father killed her.

377
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:23,600
- My father would never kill innocent people.
- You wanted to know.

378
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:27,320
- I don't believe you.
- Oh, he says it was an accident.

379
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:32,800
But when a man goes
halfway round the world to set off a bomb,

380
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:36,840
he's responsible for
any "accidents" that result.

381
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:44,080
Has your father ever talked about his work?

382
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:50,560
About where he goes...
on those long trips overseas?

383
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,280
Of course not.

384
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:59,000
- He can't.
- Because he's a criminal.

385
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,080
My father is a good man.

386
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:07,080
No.

387
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,360
He's not.

388
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:44,800
Palmer's still alive. The suite at his hotel
blew up, but apparently he got out unscathed.

389
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,520
- Why the reports?
- I haven't been debriefed,

390
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:52,520
but I guess it makes sense
as a defensive strategy.

391
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:55,640
Palmer's safe as long as
the hitters think he's dead.

392
00:34:55,720 --> 00:35:00,520
This goes no further than the three of us until
the public's made aware that he survived.

393
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,960
- What about the perpetrators?
- It's unclear.

394
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,320
Our intel is being refreshed
by Secret Service as we speak.

395
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,760
So, stay at your stations. Start rebuilding
profiles based on the incoming information

396
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:13,440
and we'll have a new plan
in place within the hour.

397
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:16,360
Have you spoken to Jack
since the first time he called?

398
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,240
Not me.

399
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,520
It doesn't matter.
This'll all be over soon anyway.

400
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:37,200
- Have you talked to Jack?
- Yeah, he called, but he won't let us help him.

401
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:54,680
It's kind of cold.
Do you mind if I have some coffee?

402
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,600
Aaargh!

403
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,080
Stop right there, Kim! Don't move!

404
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,480
Don't be foolish! You'll drown!

405
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,560
How are we going to do this without the girl?

406
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:27,040
Bauer has no choice but to trust us.

407
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:05,160
Oh, there you are.
We just got some new intel from Langley.

408
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:07,640
- Oh, good.
- Yeah, take a look at this.
