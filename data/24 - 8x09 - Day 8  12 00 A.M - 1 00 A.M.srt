00:00:30,184 --> 00:00:32,151
<i>I think she
went to meet</i>

3
00:00:32,184 --> 00:00:33,151
some guy.

4
00:00:33,184 --> 00:00:34,418
Take a look at this.

5
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:35,650
You think you can find her?

6
00:00:37,118 --> 00:00:39,218
You promise me
I do this one thing for you,

7
00:00:39,251 --> 00:00:41,151
and then you'll leave me alone.

8
00:00:41,184 --> 00:00:43,118
<i>That's not gonna happen.</i>

9
00:00:43,151 --> 00:00:45,385
This is a sweet operation
that we got going here.

10
00:00:45,418 --> 00:00:46,984
You know? You getting
the access codes,

11
00:00:47,018 --> 00:00:48,151
and us pulling the jobs.

12
00:00:48,184 --> 00:00:49,817
You can't do this to me, Kevin.

13
00:00:54,751 --> 00:00:56,650
You know who I am?

14
00:00:56,684 --> 00:00:58,684
<i>All I know is
that there's</i>

15
00:00:58,717 --> 00:01:00,550
a very powerful man
in the Russian Syndicate

16
00:01:00,584 --> 00:01:02,018
who's been trafficking
weapons-grade uranium.

17
00:01:02,051 --> 00:01:02,951
Who do you work for?

18
00:01:02,984 --> 00:01:04,550
I'm not at liberty to say.

19
00:01:04,584 --> 00:01:05,684
Dmitri, work on him,

20
00:01:05,717 --> 00:01:07,650
until he's ready
to tell us everything.

21
00:01:08,884 --> 00:01:12,218
(yelling in pain,
electrical zapping)

22
00:01:12,251 --> 00:01:14,917
(gunshots)

23
00:01:19,684 --> 00:01:22,184
It's over, you
know that, right?

24
00:01:22,218 --> 00:01:24,784
You want to know
where the rods are?

25
00:01:24,817 --> 00:01:26,051
I will tell you.

26
00:01:26,084 --> 00:01:27,851
But I want full immunity.

27
00:01:33,084 --> 00:01:34,584
Amanda, are you seeing this?

28
00:01:34,617 --> 00:01:36,218
Where the hell are the rods?

29
00:01:36,251 --> 00:01:38,418
We've picked up
trace radiation signatures.

30
00:01:38,451 --> 00:01:39,351
The rods were here.

31
00:01:39,385 --> 00:01:41,717
I told you, they were there.

32
00:01:41,751 --> 00:01:43,485
I had two of my men
guarding them.

33
00:01:43,517 --> 00:01:44,917
We found their bodies;
both shot.

34
00:01:44,951 --> 00:01:46,351
(quietly):
Josef.

35
00:01:46,385 --> 00:01:48,151
I wasn't sure I believed Josef

36
00:01:48,184 --> 00:01:49,517
that you would betray
your father.

37
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:51,751
You were upset that he was
holding up delivery of the rods.

38
00:01:51,784 --> 00:01:52,884
Now I've gotten them for you.

39
00:01:52,917 --> 00:01:54,151
When will you get here?

40
00:01:54,184 --> 00:01:55,251
Less than five minutes.

41
00:01:55,284 --> 00:01:57,418
Just have my money ready.

42
00:02:29,018 --> 00:02:30,984
*

43
00:02:47,284 --> 00:02:49,051
(speed-dialing phone)

44
00:02:52,018 --> 00:02:53,817
CTU. O'Brian.
Chloe, it's Jack.

45
00:02:53,851 --> 00:02:55,451
Do you have Hastings there?
Yes.

46
00:02:55,485 --> 00:02:57,550
Are you ready to
trace the call?
We're ready.

47
00:02:57,584 --> 00:02:59,550
As soon as Bazhaev gets
his son on the phone,

48
00:02:59,584 --> 00:03:02,717
we can begin
to triangulate.
Okay, hold on.

49
00:03:07,717 --> 00:03:09,717
(phone ringing)

50
00:03:10,917 --> 00:03:12,884
Farhad, where are you?
You're late.

51
00:03:12,917 --> 00:03:14,884
Josef, it's me, your father.

52
00:03:14,917 --> 00:03:16,485
Don't hang up.
Stay on the line.

53
00:03:16,517 --> 00:03:17,717
Please.

54
00:03:17,751 --> 00:03:19,517
I know you
have the rods.

55
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:20,717
Yes.

56
00:03:20,751 --> 00:03:22,418
I wanted you to know.

57
00:03:22,451 --> 00:03:24,351
The police know, too.
They're here.

58
00:03:24,385 --> 00:03:26,184
You told the police?

59
00:03:26,218 --> 00:03:27,550
Of course not.

60
00:03:27,584 --> 00:03:29,485
It was Vladimir's buyer--
he's a Federal agent.

61
00:03:29,517 --> 00:03:30,650
JACK:
Josef, just so we're

62
00:03:30,684 --> 00:03:32,118
up front, I'm here
with your father.

63
00:03:32,151 --> 00:03:34,051
My name is Jack Bauer;
I work with CTU.

64
00:03:34,084 --> 00:03:37,251
Well, do what you want
with him; I don't care.

65
00:03:37,284 --> 00:03:39,517
Maybe you don't--
but your father cares

66
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:41,251
about you.

67
00:03:41,284 --> 00:03:43,684
He negotiated immunity for you.

68
00:03:43,717 --> 00:03:46,151
All you need to do
is bring the fuel rods in,

69
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:48,151
and you can put
the rest of this behind you.

70
00:03:48,184 --> 00:03:49,584
It's the only way
you'll be safe.

71
00:03:49,617 --> 00:03:52,517
Safe? Did my father tell you
about my other brother?

72
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:53,851
What he did to him?

73
00:03:53,884 --> 00:03:55,385
Oleg was dying;
you know that.

74
00:03:55,418 --> 00:03:56,984
Yeah, we could have saved him.

75
00:03:57,018 --> 00:03:59,184
He would be alive if not
for your precious deal.

76
00:03:59,218 --> 00:04:01,351
You are right, maybe you
are right, I don't know,

77
00:04:01,385 --> 00:04:03,617
but... that doesn't
bring Oleg back,

78
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:06,184
and I cannot bear
to lose another son.

79
00:04:06,218 --> 00:04:07,784
Don't worry about me.

80
00:04:07,817 --> 00:04:09,650
I'll be fine.
No, you won't be.

81
00:04:09,684 --> 00:04:11,184
You won't be anything.

82
00:04:11,218 --> 00:04:12,517
It's over.

83
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:13,984
Federal agents are here

84
00:04:14,018 --> 00:04:15,018
going through
everything.

85
00:04:15,051 --> 00:04:17,550
The entire city
is under guard.

86
00:04:17,584 --> 00:04:20,451
If you don't bring
the rods in, they
will hunt you down.

87
00:04:20,485 --> 00:04:21,617
They will kill you, Josef.

88
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:24,550
I won't be able
to protect you.

89
00:04:25,584 --> 00:04:27,751
I don't want to see you hurt.

90
00:04:31,084 --> 00:04:32,984
If I hand over the rods,

91
00:04:33,018 --> 00:04:35,051
how does this work?

92
00:04:35,084 --> 00:04:37,817
Tell us where you are,
and we'll bring you in.

93
00:04:37,851 --> 00:04:39,318
Oh, just like that?

94
00:04:39,351 --> 00:04:40,684
After everything
we've done?

95
00:04:40,717 --> 00:04:43,318
Yes, I told you-- they
have given us immunity.

96
00:04:43,351 --> 00:04:45,784
Please, Josef, please.

97
00:04:47,018 --> 00:04:49,917
This is your last chance.

98
00:04:51,251 --> 00:04:52,951
Are you there?

99
00:04:52,984 --> 00:04:54,650
Yes, I'm here.

100
00:04:54,684 --> 00:04:56,084
You need to bring him in now,

101
00:04:56,118 --> 00:04:58,051
before Farhad
gets there.

102
00:04:58,084 --> 00:04:59,617
Josef, did you hear that?

103
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:01,084
You need to move.

104
00:05:01,118 --> 00:05:02,851
Josef?

105
00:05:05,351 --> 00:05:06,917
All right, I'm on my way.

106
00:05:06,951 --> 00:05:10,251
I'll call you from the road to
let you know where to meet me.

107
00:05:10,284 --> 00:05:11,485
Careful with the rods.

108
00:05:13,717 --> 00:05:15,451
(shot booms)

109
00:05:15,485 --> 00:05:16,517
Sounded like
shots fired.

110
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:17,817
You need to help him!

111
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:18,717
Where is he?!

112
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:19,884
I don't know.

113
00:05:19,917 --> 00:05:21,517
Chloe, did you get a
trace on that call?

114
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:23,218
Not exactly, but it
looks like he was

115
00:05:23,251 --> 00:05:25,817
in central Queens
near Flushing Meadow Park.

116
00:05:25,851 --> 00:05:27,218
I want units
combing that area.

117
00:05:27,251 --> 00:05:29,284
Jack, bring
your suspect
back to CTU.
Copy that.

118
00:05:29,318 --> 00:05:32,584
<i>Get him ready
for transport now.</i>

119
00:05:36,018 --> 00:05:37,650
Is he dead?
Yes.

120
00:05:37,684 --> 00:05:39,485
We need to hurry.

121
00:05:39,517 --> 00:05:41,485
(over phone):
The boat is waiting for us
at the port.

122
00:05:41,517 --> 00:05:42,485
The port may not
be the right thing.

123
00:05:42,517 --> 00:05:44,385
What do you mean?

124
00:05:44,418 --> 00:05:45,684
The authorities know our plan.

125
00:05:45,717 --> 00:05:47,884
We need a new one.

126
00:05:47,917 --> 00:05:49,318
Hey.

127
00:05:54,851 --> 00:05:56,784
Did you get that?

128
00:05:56,817 --> 00:05:59,617
Yes, Jack. We're
trying to get an I.D.
off the voice print.

129
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,650
So far, no luck locking
down a location.

130
00:06:01,684 --> 00:06:04,684
Copy that.
We're on our way back now.

131
00:06:14,251 --> 00:06:16,584
We need to hurry.
Take the van and get the rods...

132
00:06:16,617 --> 00:06:18,218
We've got a match for the voice

133
00:06:18,251 --> 00:06:20,084
at the end of the call--
Farhad Hassan.

134
00:06:20,118 --> 00:06:21,884
So, he got
his fuel rods.

135
00:06:21,917 --> 00:06:24,517
Any I.D. on the
other man we heard?
No, sir.

136
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:27,884
Mr. Hastings,
Rob Weiss for you.

137
00:06:27,917 --> 00:06:29,084
Tell him I'll be

138
00:06:29,118 --> 00:06:31,184
right with him.

139
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:34,984
Give me an ETA on Bazhaev.

140
00:06:35,018 --> 00:06:36,984
Yes, sir.
Start the interrogation

141
00:06:37,018 --> 00:06:38,817
as soon as he gets here.

142
00:06:42,751 --> 00:06:45,118
(phone rings)
Yeah?

143
00:06:45,151 --> 00:06:47,218
Jack, it's Chloe.
Hastings wants your ETA.

144
00:06:47,251 --> 00:06:48,617
He's anxious to
interrogate Bazhaev.

145
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:50,018
I'm about
15 minutes out.

146
00:06:50,051 --> 00:06:51,784
But I wouldn't count on
getting anything from him.

147
00:06:51,817 --> 00:06:54,151
If Bazhaev could have told me
how to get to the people

148
00:06:54,184 --> 00:06:55,717
that just killed his
son, he would have.

149
00:06:55,751 --> 00:06:58,717
Jack, I heard about
what you went through.

150
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:01,650
Are you okay?

151
00:07:01,684 --> 00:07:04,418
Yeah, I'm fine. Thanks.

152
00:07:04,451 --> 00:07:06,018
How's Renee?

153
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:08,284
Pretty worried about you.

154
00:07:08,318 --> 00:07:10,151
They've still got her
in medical.

155
00:07:10,184 --> 00:07:13,218
Yeah. Could you
patch me through to her?

156
00:07:13,251 --> 00:07:14,318
Hold on.

157
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:16,084
Okay.

158
00:07:16,118 --> 00:07:19,550
(phone rings)

159
00:07:19,584 --> 00:07:20,584
Hey.

160
00:07:20,617 --> 00:07:21,917
Rene, I have Jack.

161
00:07:24,051 --> 00:07:25,284
Jack.

162
00:07:25,318 --> 00:07:26,717
How are you?

163
00:07:26,751 --> 00:07:28,717
Uh, fine, I'm fine.
What about you?

164
00:07:28,751 --> 00:07:30,284
We had a line
on the fuel rods.

165
00:07:30,318 --> 00:07:32,084
We lost it.

166
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:34,884
So what's the plan now?

167
00:07:34,917 --> 00:07:36,385
It's Hastings' call.

168
00:07:36,418 --> 00:07:38,650
I'm bringing the prisoner
back to CTU, then I'm out.

169
00:07:38,684 --> 00:07:41,051
They ask you about what
happened, about Vladimir?

170
00:07:41,084 --> 00:07:42,650
Uh, yes, Chloe did.

171
00:07:42,684 --> 00:07:43,917
Chloe did the debrief?

172
00:07:43,951 --> 00:07:45,385
Yeah. I mean, I wouldn't...

173
00:07:45,418 --> 00:07:47,184
I wouldn't really
call it a debrief.

174
00:07:47,218 --> 00:07:50,650
We talked, uh,
mostly, and, uh,

175
00:07:50,684 --> 00:07:53,318
then I wrote a statement.
And you explained how
you acted in self-defense?

176
00:07:53,351 --> 00:07:54,418
Yes, like we agreed.

177
00:07:54,451 --> 00:07:55,617
That's how it happened.

178
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:56,951
Renee, you've got
to stick with that.

179
00:07:56,984 --> 00:07:59,650
Yeah, yes, I'm gonna try.

180
00:07:59,684 --> 00:08:01,817
I know this is hard for you,

181
00:08:01,851 --> 00:08:03,851
but you did nothing wrong,

182
00:08:03,884 --> 00:08:07,684
and you need to start
believing that.

183
00:08:07,717 --> 00:08:09,051
Okay?

184
00:08:09,084 --> 00:08:11,318
(exhales):
Okay.

185
00:08:11,351 --> 00:08:14,351
Jack, I don't...
I don't know how to say this,

186
00:08:14,385 --> 00:08:16,351
so I'm just gonna say it,
'cause I need to make sure

187
00:08:16,385 --> 00:08:18,184
that I'm not
misunderstanding, but..

188
00:08:18,218 --> 00:08:20,451
when you say
that I "have you"...

189
00:08:20,485 --> 00:08:22,218
I meant it like it sounded.

190
00:08:23,617 --> 00:08:25,584
So now what do we do?

191
00:08:25,617 --> 00:08:28,151
We'll figure it out.

192
00:08:28,184 --> 00:08:30,318
Okay.

193
00:08:30,351 --> 00:08:32,617
I'll be in in about 15 minutes.

194
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:34,151
Bye.

195
00:08:49,717 --> 00:08:52,351
Rob, it's Brian.
I just got a flash
from your office how this

196
00:08:52,385 --> 00:08:54,284
immunity situation the
president authorized
played out.

197
00:08:54,318 --> 00:08:55,851
It's not good, Brian.

198
00:08:55,884 --> 00:08:57,118
Really not.

199
00:08:57,151 --> 00:08:58,851
Now, as I understand it,
Bazhaev's son swiped

200
00:08:58,884 --> 00:09:00,784
the rods from his father
before we got there.

201
00:09:00,817 --> 00:09:01,851
That's correct.

202
00:09:01,884 --> 00:09:03,684
And now the son
is dead.
Yes.

203
00:09:03,717 --> 00:09:05,517
Do we know who
has the rods now?

204
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:08,018
Apparently, it's
Farhad Hassan.

205
00:09:08,051 --> 00:09:09,351
And where is he?

206
00:09:09,385 --> 00:09:11,984
We're looking.
Meaning you have no idea.

207
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:13,650
Brian, I pushed the president
to resurrect CTU

208
00:09:13,684 --> 00:09:14,917
with you at the helm.

209
00:09:14,951 --> 00:09:17,517
Now, you tell me you can do
the job, I believe you.

210
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:18,517
I can do the job.

211
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:19,784
Good to hear it.

212
00:09:19,817 --> 00:09:21,851
'Cause when things get
this colossally screwed up,

213
00:09:21,884 --> 00:09:24,784
people look for
someone to blame.

214
00:09:24,817 --> 00:09:26,617
So what are you saying?

215
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:29,084
I'm saying I don't want
that person to be you.

216
00:09:29,118 --> 00:09:31,717
I put you there;
you're my guy.

217
00:09:31,751 --> 00:09:33,650
If you fail, I fail.

218
00:09:33,684 --> 00:09:35,917
And that cannot happen.

219
00:09:35,951 --> 00:09:38,351
Are we on the
same page here?

220
00:09:38,385 --> 00:09:41,051
So what have you got in mind?

221
00:09:41,084 --> 00:09:43,385
Renee Walker.

222
00:09:43,418 --> 00:09:45,851
She killed one of our main
leads, isn't that correct?

223
00:09:45,884 --> 00:09:47,817
He was a psychopath--
she was defending herself.

224
00:09:47,851 --> 00:09:49,650
She stabbed him 15 times.

225
00:09:49,684 --> 00:09:51,684
What, are you saying
it was murder?

226
00:09:51,717 --> 00:09:53,717
I'm saying that's
for lawyers to decide.

227
00:09:53,751 --> 00:09:56,817
We're talking about a woman
who put her life on the line

228
00:09:56,851 --> 00:09:58,151
when she didn't have to.

229
00:09:58,184 --> 00:09:59,917
I'm sure that will
weigh in her favor.

230
00:09:59,951 --> 00:10:01,485
You know what
a conviction would mean--

231
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:02,617
she'd go away for years.

232
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:04,550
Well, someone has to
pay for this, Brian.

233
00:10:04,584 --> 00:10:06,717
so you tell me-- who
do you want that to be?

234
00:10:08,751 --> 00:10:10,717
I'm sending someone over
from Justice.

235
00:10:10,751 --> 00:10:12,617
A Kristin Smith.

236
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:14,650
She'll take care of everything.

237
00:10:16,184 --> 00:10:17,984
What do you need from me?

238
00:10:18,018 --> 00:10:20,517
Just open the door
and get out of the way.

239
00:10:33,434 --> 00:10:34,567
We did a sweep, sir.

240
00:10:34,601 --> 00:10:36,434
No trace of any
hazardous materials.

241
00:10:36,467 --> 00:10:38,834
Fine. Finish up,
get back to base.
Yes, sir.

242
00:10:38,867 --> 00:10:41,200
(phone rings)

243
00:10:42,701 --> 00:10:44,100
Arlo?

244
00:10:44,133 --> 00:10:45,400
Yeah.

245
00:10:45,434 --> 00:10:47,001
Find Dana yet?
I think so.

246
00:10:47,034 --> 00:10:49,133
I'm tracking the GPS
coordinates off her phone.

247
00:10:49,167 --> 00:10:50,968
All right, send
them to my PDA.

248
00:10:51,001 --> 00:10:53,701
Are you sure that's a good idea?
I mean, there could be

249
00:10:53,734 --> 00:10:56,267
a reasonable explanation...
Hey, you're the one
who stuck his nose in all this.

250
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,467
Just do it.

251
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,701
Okay.

252
00:10:59,734 --> 00:11:01,300
Coordinates are
on your phone.

253
00:11:01,334 --> 00:11:02,434
Thanks.

254
00:11:02,467 --> 00:11:04,001
Look, I'm sending
everyone back to CTU.

255
00:11:04,034 --> 00:11:05,467
What are you
going to do?

256
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,701
I'll be there within the hour.

257
00:11:06,734 --> 00:11:07,968
If Hastings asks,

258
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:09,834
just tell him
I'm following up a lead.

259
00:11:09,867 --> 00:11:11,734
Look, I know Dana means
a lot to you,

260
00:11:11,767 --> 00:11:14,167
but do you really think this is
worth going AWOL over?

261
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,133
She's my fiancee, Arlo.

262
00:11:22,601 --> 00:11:25,100
Jim, I'm taking your vehicle.

263
00:11:25,133 --> 00:11:27,667
Find Owen, have him
take SWAT back to CTU.

264
00:11:27,701 --> 00:11:29,100
Say I'll be
right behind them.

265
00:11:29,133 --> 00:11:30,567
No problem, sir.

266
00:12:01,434 --> 00:12:04,434
(faint music from van radio)

267
00:12:23,001 --> 00:12:25,400
(rock music plays loudly,
indistinct conversation)

268
00:12:25,434 --> 00:12:27,434
(chuckles)

269
00:12:43,467 --> 00:12:45,133
Is Dana back yet?

270
00:12:45,167 --> 00:12:46,434
I don't think so, sir.

271
00:12:46,467 --> 00:12:47,901
Do you need her
for something?

272
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:50,601
Do I need her for something?

273
00:12:50,634 --> 00:12:53,467
Yes, Arlo,
she's my chief data analyst.

274
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,701
I need her to do her job.

275
00:12:55,734 --> 00:12:59,200
You track her down,
and you let me know
when you find her.

276
00:12:59,233 --> 00:13:01,667
Mr. Hastings, Kristin Smith
from the Justice Department

277
00:13:01,701 --> 00:13:03,534
is here to see you.
Thank you.

278
00:13:12,233 --> 00:13:14,200
Ms. Smith.

279
00:13:14,233 --> 00:13:15,968
Mr. Hastings.

280
00:13:16,001 --> 00:13:17,068
Did Rob Weiss brief you?
He did.

281
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,100
I have to interview
a Renee Walker.

282
00:13:18,133 --> 00:13:20,334
I read her statement
on the way over.

283
00:13:20,367 --> 00:13:22,167
Did it appear to you that
she's guilty of murder?

284
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,434
Mr. Weiss warned me you might
have issues with this.

285
00:13:25,467 --> 00:13:27,334
With hanging a brave woman
out to dry?

286
00:13:27,367 --> 00:13:28,767
Yes, I do.

287
00:13:28,801 --> 00:13:30,867
There are major discrepancies
between her statement

288
00:13:30,901 --> 00:13:32,068
and the forensic evidence.

289
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,334
All I'm asking her to do

290
00:13:33,367 --> 00:13:36,300
is to set
the record straight.

291
00:13:37,968 --> 00:13:40,968
I feel it would be prudent
to restrict surveillance access

292
00:13:41,001 --> 00:13:43,434
to this interview.
Fine.

293
00:13:43,467 --> 00:13:45,534
But I would also like
a video record of it

294
00:13:45,567 --> 00:13:46,801
in the event
of legal proceedings.

295
00:13:46,834 --> 00:13:48,334
Can I ask you to provide that?

296
00:13:48,367 --> 00:13:50,968
Yes. Right this way, please.

297
00:14:01,834 --> 00:14:03,634
This is a transcript
of your statement.

298
00:14:03,667 --> 00:14:05,267
You should review it

299
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:08,233
before you sign it.

300
00:14:08,267 --> 00:14:10,001
How far out did Jack
say he was?

301
00:14:10,034 --> 00:14:11,834
15 minutes.

302
00:14:14,068 --> 00:14:15,434
This is Kristin Smith
from Justice.

303
00:14:15,467 --> 00:14:16,901
She needs to
talk to Renee,

304
00:14:16,934 --> 00:14:18,400
so if you'll
excuse us, Chloe.

305
00:14:18,434 --> 00:14:19,667
Talk to her about what?

306
00:14:19,701 --> 00:14:20,767
Now, Chloe.

307
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:29,767
Thank you, Mr. Hastings.

308
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,767
What is she talking
to her about?

309
00:14:38,801 --> 00:14:40,133
She was about to sign
her statement.

310
00:14:40,167 --> 00:14:41,367
I already
debriefed her.

311
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,667
Kristin just needs
to fill in a few details.

312
00:14:42,701 --> 00:14:43,801
I already filled in
the details.

313
00:14:43,834 --> 00:14:45,834
I know that you are
protective of Renee.

314
00:14:45,867 --> 00:14:48,167
I respect that.
Than let me sit in
on the interview.

315
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,734
Why?

316
00:14:49,767 --> 00:14:52,667
Was your debrief not
a full and honest
statement of the facts?

317
00:14:52,701 --> 00:14:54,867
We have nuclear materials
in the hands of terrorists.

318
00:14:54,901 --> 00:14:57,233
Now, I need you back
at your desk focused on that.

319
00:14:59,701 --> 00:15:00,901
Yes, sir.

320
00:15:12,734 --> 00:15:14,801
What is this place?

321
00:15:14,834 --> 00:15:17,034
A staging area.

322
00:15:17,068 --> 00:15:19,133
It belongs to a businessman
who supports our cause.

323
00:15:19,167 --> 00:15:20,701
I don't want
to delay too long.

324
00:15:20,734 --> 00:15:22,500
We need to find
another way

325
00:15:22,534 --> 00:15:24,801
to get the nuclear rods
out of the country.

326
00:15:24,834 --> 00:15:27,500
You heard what the American said
to Bazhaev's son.

327
00:15:27,534 --> 00:15:29,200
They already know
what we're trying to do.

328
00:15:29,233 --> 00:15:31,100
Which is why we need
to move quickly.

329
00:15:31,133 --> 00:15:33,567
The Americans are not
stupid, Farhad.

330
00:15:33,601 --> 00:15:35,734
If we go near
any airfield

331
00:15:35,767 --> 00:15:40,167
or harbor now, the radiological
detectors will spot us.

332
00:16:09,901 --> 00:16:11,934
Who are these men, Samir?

333
00:16:11,968 --> 00:16:15,334
These are men I have recruited.
Our men.

334
00:16:15,367 --> 00:16:16,567
What are they doing here?

335
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:17,767
They're going to unload
the rods.

336
00:16:17,801 --> 00:16:19,500
We need to get rid
of the van.

337
00:16:19,534 --> 00:16:20,500
And then what?

338
00:16:20,534 --> 00:16:23,001
You should rest.

339
00:16:23,034 --> 00:16:24,434
I don't need to rest.

340
00:16:24,467 --> 00:16:26,334
I need to know
what we're doing.

341
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,267
We can't get the rods
out of the country.

342
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,300
So let's use them.

343
00:16:36,334 --> 00:16:39,068
Use them? How?

344
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,434
As a weapon.

345
00:16:40,467 --> 00:16:42,567
A radiological bomb.

346
00:16:42,601 --> 00:16:47,100
Wel show the Americans
how strong we are.

347
00:16:47,133 --> 00:16:48,834
Show them how strong we are?

348
00:16:48,867 --> 00:16:51,034
Are you out
of your mind?

349
00:16:51,068 --> 00:16:52,534
If we use the rods

350
00:16:52,567 --> 00:16:56,567
against the Americans,
they will destroy our country.

351
00:16:56,601 --> 00:16:59,934
They'll bomb us, invade.

352
00:16:59,968 --> 00:17:02,267
And if we do nothing,
they'll invade us anyway.

353
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:06,233
That's what this peace treaty
with your brother is all about.

354
00:17:06,267 --> 00:17:09,601
They're trying to turn us
into another corrupt,

355
00:17:09,634 --> 00:17:11,701
Mid-East regime with
your brother as dictator,

356
00:17:11,734 --> 00:17:13,534
kept in power by
American guns

357
00:17:13,567 --> 00:17:15,267
and money.

358
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,968
Isn't that what we came together

359
00:17:17,001 --> 00:17:18,701
to prevent?

360
00:17:28,767 --> 00:17:30,534
Is there no other way?

361
00:17:30,567 --> 00:17:35,100
America will always
be our enemy.

362
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,434
Remember, my friend--

363
00:17:41,367 --> 00:17:44,567
even a giant can be toppled
by a single stone.

364
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:52,034
We need to make them fear us.

365
00:18:01,367 --> 00:18:03,300
Then I'm with you.

366
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,734
SMITH:
So you said in your statement

367
00:18:42,768 --> 00:18:46,434
that you killed Vladimir
Laitanan in self-defense.

368
00:18:46,467 --> 00:18:48,000
Is that correct?

369
00:18:48,033 --> 00:18:49,900
Yes, that's why it's
in my statement.

370
00:18:49,933 --> 00:18:52,167
What I didn't see
in the statement

371
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,701
was any mention of your history
with Laitanan.

372
00:18:54,734 --> 00:18:56,768
You did have a history with him.

373
00:18:56,801 --> 00:19:00,134
I worked an undercover operation
with the FBI six years ago.

374
00:19:00,167 --> 00:19:01,401
Vladimir Laitanan
was the target.

375
00:19:01,434 --> 00:19:03,467
And during the course
of that operation,

376
00:19:03,501 --> 00:19:05,667
you had to get close to him.

377
00:19:05,701 --> 00:19:06,933
He became obsessed with you.

378
00:19:06,967 --> 00:19:09,933
He tried
to rape you.

379
00:19:09,967 --> 00:19:11,033
Yes.

380
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:13,200
But you were able to stop him.

381
00:19:13,234 --> 00:19:15,067
I fought him.

382
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,701
Put me in the hospital
with two broken ribs.

383
00:19:17,734 --> 00:19:19,300
I'm sure that's in there, too.

384
00:19:19,334 --> 00:19:21,933
You were able to fight off
a stronger, violent man.

385
00:19:21,967 --> 00:19:25,868
It's impressive.

386
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,734
But this time
when he attacked you,

387
00:19:27,768 --> 00:19:29,067
you didn't fight him off.

388
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:32,000
I couldn't.

389
00:19:32,033 --> 00:19:34,933
He had his hands around my neck
trying to strangle me.

390
00:19:35,967 --> 00:19:38,501
I understand.

391
00:19:38,534 --> 00:19:40,567
You thought he was going
to kill you.

392
00:19:40,601 --> 00:19:42,200
You were in fear for your life.

393
00:19:48,834 --> 00:19:50,134
So what happened next?

394
00:19:52,834 --> 00:19:55,868
He was choking me.

395
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,933
I grabbed the knife
and I stabbed him.

396
00:19:57,967 --> 00:19:59,900
In self-defense?

397
00:19:59,933 --> 00:20:02,567
Yes.

398
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:07,768
You stabbed him
in self-defense... 15 times.

399
00:20:08,834 --> 00:20:11,467
15 times.

400
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:13,000
The first blow alone

401
00:20:13,033 --> 00:20:16,501
could have stopped him,
but you didn't stop.

402
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,967
Look at me, Renee.

403
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,801
You were an investigator
for the FBI.

404
00:20:26,834 --> 00:20:28,167
By all accounts,

405
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,501
one of the best they had.

406
00:20:30,534 --> 00:20:32,701
Put yourself on my
side of the table.

407
00:20:32,734 --> 00:20:34,768
Look at what
I'm looking at.

408
00:20:34,801 --> 00:20:37,267
There's a dead body.

409
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:40,267
On the one hand,
I have your statement

410
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,501
saying you acted
in self-defense.

411
00:20:42,534 --> 00:20:44,501
On the other, I have these.

412
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:45,667
Evidence of a sustained

413
00:20:45,701 --> 00:20:50,467
and furious assault
with clear intent to kill.

414
00:20:50,501 --> 00:20:51,701
Now as an investigator,

415
00:20:51,734 --> 00:20:53,900
you know which version
is true, don't you?

416
00:20:56,067 --> 00:20:58,167
I acted in self-defense.

417
00:21:02,401 --> 00:21:05,367
Let me tell you
what I think happened.

418
00:21:05,401 --> 00:21:09,834
You used an operation of
unparalleled importance

419
00:21:09,868 --> 00:21:12,267
to seek revenge against a
target without any regard

420
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,534
for the final
outcome.

421
00:21:13,567 --> 00:21:15,300
I'm telling you,
he attacked me first.

422
00:21:15,334 --> 00:21:17,567
Ms. Walker, I'm well aware
of your sacrifice

423
00:21:17,601 --> 00:21:21,167
in service to this country,
but I do not think

424
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,367
that it is fair or right
that CTU should be taken down

425
00:21:25,401 --> 00:21:27,267
because you used this
operation to seek out

426
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,501
your own personal
vendetta

427
00:21:28,534 --> 00:21:30,868
against Vladimir Laitanan.

428
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:33,868
I looked at your file.

429
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:38,334
This isn't the first time
you lost control.

430
00:21:38,367 --> 00:21:42,434
You almost killed Alan Wilson.

431
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:46,768
That's why you got fired
by the FBI, isn't it?

432
00:21:46,801 --> 00:21:50,367
Yes.

433
00:21:52,967 --> 00:21:56,167
I can see what this is
doing to you, Renee.

434
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:59,200
It is tearing you
up inside.

435
00:22:00,801 --> 00:22:03,734
Let it out.
Tell me the truth.

436
00:22:03,768 --> 00:22:06,634
You killed Vladimir Laitanan
because the thought

437
00:22:06,667 --> 00:22:11,734
of him touching you again
was intolerable.

438
00:22:11,768 --> 00:22:13,768
Do the right thing here.

439
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:17,900
That's what happened,
isn't it, Renee?

440
00:22:26,768 --> 00:22:30,567
Is that right, Renee?

441
00:22:34,601 --> 00:22:36,601
(tires screeching)

442
00:22:43,634 --> 00:22:45,000
Put him into holding.

443
00:22:45,033 --> 00:22:46,100
No phone calls.
No communication.

444
00:22:46,134 --> 00:22:47,401
I would like
to see my son's body.

445
00:22:47,434 --> 00:22:49,667
We haven't found him yet.

446
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:51,434
What's wrong?
I've been trying
to reach you.

447
00:22:51,467 --> 00:22:53,734
It's about Renee. She's
being questioned again.

448
00:22:53,768 --> 00:22:55,334
I thought you said you already
completed the debrief.

449
00:22:55,367 --> 00:22:56,634
I did. Hastings ordered it.

450
00:22:56,667 --> 00:22:59,200
He called in some woman
from the Justice Department.

451
00:22:59,234 --> 00:23:00,868
Where's Renee now?

452
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,768
She's in medical.

453
00:23:02,801 --> 00:23:05,434
Can you get eyes
in that room?

454
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:06,933
No. He cut off
all access.

455
00:23:06,967 --> 00:23:08,267
What is going on?

456
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,900
They're setting her up
to take the fall

457
00:23:09,933 --> 00:23:11,067
for the failure
of this mission.

458
00:23:27,768 --> 00:23:29,401
Sorry, sir.
No one's...

459
00:23:37,234 --> 00:23:38,334
They're setting you up.
Don't say another word.

460
00:23:38,367 --> 00:23:40,167
It's too late.

461
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,801
What do you think you're doing?
Get out of here now.

462
00:23:44,033 --> 00:23:44,933
How dare you?

463
00:23:44,967 --> 00:23:48,134
After everything
she sacrificed.

464
00:23:48,167 --> 00:23:50,267
After everything
she's lost.

465
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,434
Have you no decency?

466
00:23:51,467 --> 00:23:54,067
Jack.

467
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,167
(groans)

468
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,900
This is over.

469
00:23:59,467 --> 00:24:00,768
Hands in the air.

470
00:24:00,801 --> 00:24:03,000
Do it now!

471
00:24:03,033 --> 00:24:04,634
Son, you better
put that down

472
00:24:04,667 --> 00:24:06,501
or you're going
to get hurt.

473
00:24:08,868 --> 00:24:09,834
It's all right.

474
00:24:09,868 --> 00:24:12,768
Go.

475
00:24:12,801 --> 00:24:14,701
(electricity crackling,
screaming)

476
00:24:14,734 --> 00:24:17,667
Ma'am, hands
in the air.

477
00:24:17,701 --> 00:24:19,701
(groans)

478
00:24:34,467 --> 00:24:35,868
Do you have what you need

479
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:39,234
to turn
the rods into a bomb?

480
00:24:39,267 --> 00:24:41,000
We're gathering
materials.

481
00:24:41,033 --> 00:24:42,200
Must be difficult

482
00:24:42,234 --> 00:24:44,501
at such
short notice.

483
00:24:44,534 --> 00:24:49,367
Explosives, no.
Detonator?

484
00:24:49,401 --> 00:24:52,033
We're working on it.

485
00:24:52,067 --> 00:24:54,768
I might know somebody.

486
00:24:54,801 --> 00:24:56,868
A professor in the city.

487
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:59,234
With expertise
in electronics.

488
00:24:59,267 --> 00:25:00,534
You sure
he can be trusted?

489
00:25:00,567 --> 00:25:01,701
Yes.

490
00:25:01,734 --> 00:25:03,134
He will help.

491
00:25:03,167 --> 00:25:05,033
He will do
whatever I ask.

492
00:25:05,067 --> 00:25:07,367
But still...

493
00:25:07,401 --> 00:25:10,334
I will bring this
up very carefully.

494
00:25:10,367 --> 00:25:12,834
I need to talk
to him in private.

495
00:25:15,167 --> 00:25:16,634
Very well.

496
00:25:16,667 --> 00:25:18,300
There's a phone
in the office.

497
00:25:18,334 --> 00:25:21,200
Ali will take you.

498
00:25:26,634 --> 00:25:29,000
(engine starting)

499
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:49,467
What is the target?
Is that decided?

500
00:25:52,267 --> 00:25:55,234
So many targets in New York.

501
00:25:55,267 --> 00:25:57,234
It will be hard
to choose.

502
00:26:00,467 --> 00:26:02,167
(screams)

503
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,967
(groans)

504
00:26:10,701 --> 00:26:12,834
Samir!
Over here!

505
00:26:14,567 --> 00:26:18,367
(shouting in native language)

506
00:26:28,967 --> 00:26:30,734
It was Farhad.
He escaped.

507
00:26:30,768 --> 00:26:33,834
Find him!

508
00:26:33,868 --> 00:26:35,634
Now!

509
00:26:35,667 --> 00:26:38,234
(man shouting
in native language)

510
00:26:55,027 --> 00:26:56,628
Cuffs off.

511
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:02,194
Give us the room.

512
00:27:03,994 --> 00:27:05,561
Sit down, Jack.

513
00:27:05,594 --> 00:27:07,561
I'll stand.

514
00:27:07,594 --> 00:27:10,194
So, this is the new CTU--
you hang your own.

515
00:27:10,227 --> 00:27:12,494
If you mean Renee Walker, we're
just asking some questions.

516
00:27:12,527 --> 00:27:13,728
Standard procedure.

517
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,760
Standard procedure is a debrief,
which Chloe completed.

518
00:27:15,827 --> 00:27:19,227
But instead, you've got
some hack from Justice in there

519
00:27:19,261 --> 00:27:20,494
trying to initiate
a criminal prosecution.

520
00:27:20,527 --> 00:27:21,728
We're just trying to
establish the facts.

521
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,294
You're trying
to save your ass.

522
00:27:24,994 --> 00:27:27,194
I was there when you
asked her for her help.

523
00:27:27,227 --> 00:27:30,094
And she gave it to you,
and we acquired the target.

524
00:27:30,127 --> 00:27:33,494
And this is how
you pay her back.

525
00:27:33,527 --> 00:27:35,427
I'm not going
to let you do this.

526
00:27:35,461 --> 00:27:37,461
I'll call
the White House first.

527
00:27:37,494 --> 00:27:39,227
The White House knows.

528
00:27:39,261 --> 00:27:40,960
Rob Weiss
sent that woman over here.

529
00:27:40,994 --> 00:27:42,194
Sorry. Maybe I wasn't clear.

530
00:27:42,227 --> 00:27:43,494
I meant I'd call the president.

531
00:27:43,527 --> 00:27:45,494
Well, good luck with that,
Jack, because I think

532
00:27:45,527 --> 00:27:47,927
the president takes
murder pretty seriously.

533
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:50,661
My recollection? She
prosecuted her own daughter.

534
00:27:52,361 --> 00:27:56,494
Now, I'm not asking.
Sit down.

535
00:28:07,194 --> 00:28:08,927
Sorry to interrupt.

536
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,294
We're busy, Chloe.
I don't mean to intrude,

537
00:28:11,327 --> 00:28:13,927
but I've got Farhad Hassan
on the line.
Farhad Hassan?

538
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,860
I didn't believe it, either,
but the voice prints match.

539
00:28:15,893 --> 00:28:17,461
Can you tell where he is?

540
00:28:17,494 --> 00:28:18,561
No. He's on a secure line.

541
00:28:18,594 --> 00:28:19,760
Can I just put him through?

542
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:26,060
Mr. Hassan.

543
00:28:26,094 --> 00:28:28,561
This is Brian Hastings,
director of CTU.

544
00:28:28,594 --> 00:28:30,793
There are people chasing me.

545
00:28:30,827 --> 00:28:32,194
They have the rods
you're looking for.

546
00:28:32,227 --> 00:28:33,628
I thought you
had the rods.

547
00:28:33,661 --> 00:28:35,394
No. No more.

548
00:28:35,427 --> 00:28:36,694
They turned against me.

549
00:28:36,728 --> 00:28:37,927
They have their own plan--

550
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,194
an attack on New York.

551
00:28:39,227 --> 00:28:40,960
An attack on New York?

552
00:28:40,994 --> 00:28:42,060
When, exactly?

553
00:28:42,094 --> 00:28:43,394
Soon.

554
00:28:43,427 --> 00:28:44,294
Very soon.

555
00:28:44,327 --> 00:28:45,461
Who are these people?

556
00:28:45,494 --> 00:28:47,494
They are IRK operatives
working in this country.

557
00:28:47,527 --> 00:28:48,960
Okay, I need names.

558
00:28:48,994 --> 00:28:51,294
Just get me out of here.

559
00:28:51,327 --> 00:28:53,494
I'll tell you everything I know.

560
00:28:53,527 --> 00:28:54,994
We'll get you out, Mr. Hassan.

561
00:28:55,027 --> 00:28:57,027
I give you my word.
Now, where are you?

562
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:59,527
Forest Hills.

563
00:28:59,561 --> 00:29:02,860
Uh, some kind
of boat warehouse.

564
00:29:02,893 --> 00:29:05,294
Hurry. I'm injured.

565
00:29:05,327 --> 00:29:06,427
They're hunting me.

566
00:29:06,461 --> 00:29:08,160
Hold on and keep
this line open.

567
00:29:08,194 --> 00:29:10,060
What do you
want me to do?

568
00:29:10,094 --> 00:29:11,760
Pinpoint his location
and get me Cole.

569
00:29:11,793 --> 00:29:12,927
I can't.

570
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,027
What do you mean,
you can't?

571
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:15,160
His team came back.
He didn't.

572
00:29:15,194 --> 00:29:17,361
Owen said he was
following a lead.

573
00:29:17,394 --> 00:29:18,694
All right, fine.
Get me Owen.

574
00:29:18,728 --> 00:29:19,827
Tell him he's going
to be leading the team.

575
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:20,827
Owen? Are you sure?

576
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:22,527
Just do it, Chloe.

577
00:29:22,561 --> 00:29:24,527
(sighs)

578
00:29:29,394 --> 00:29:31,793
They're going to take
you down and process you.

579
00:29:31,827 --> 00:29:34,060
I want you out of this building.

580
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,628
Fine.

581
00:29:54,728 --> 00:29:56,793
(rustling and banging)

582
00:29:58,494 --> 00:29:59,461
(van door opens)

583
00:30:02,027 --> 00:30:03,994
(rock music playing)

584
00:30:04,027 --> 00:30:06,261
Hey, hey, come on.

585
00:30:06,294 --> 00:30:07,494
What's the hurry?
What's the hurry?

586
00:30:07,527 --> 00:30:08,793
What's the hurry?
Your friend's

587
00:30:08,827 --> 00:30:10,361
a total freak show.

588
00:30:10,394 --> 00:30:12,027
I know, but come on.

589
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,994
Don't go.
I'll make it up to you.

590
00:30:14,027 --> 00:30:15,628
Okay? Come on.

591
00:30:15,661 --> 00:30:17,060
At least let me give you
a ride back into town.

592
00:30:17,094 --> 00:30:18,261
We'll walk.

593
00:30:19,661 --> 00:30:22,160
Night, ladies!

594
00:30:22,194 --> 00:30:25,494
(laughing)

595
00:30:25,527 --> 00:30:27,994
(both sigh)

596
00:30:28,027 --> 00:30:29,294
Gonna take a leak.

597
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:31,294
All right.

598
00:30:32,361 --> 00:30:34,227
(banging)

599
00:30:34,261 --> 00:30:35,461
(guy laughing)

600
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:54,860
*

601
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:12,394
Cole, what are you doing here?

602
00:31:12,427 --> 00:31:13,860
You're asking me that?
We're in the middle

603
00:31:13,893 --> 00:31:15,827
of an operation, Dana. You
can't just abandon your post.

604
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:17,461
I can explain.

605
00:31:17,494 --> 00:31:18,927
You can explain later.

606
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,793
Right now, I'm taking you
back to CTU.

607
00:31:20,827 --> 00:31:22,527
We can deal with
our personal problems

608
00:31:22,561 --> 00:31:23,960
after we've secured
the nuclear materials.

609
00:31:23,994 --> 00:31:24,960
It's not what you think.

610
00:31:24,994 --> 00:31:26,561
Yeah? What do I think?

611
00:31:26,594 --> 00:31:28,060
I am not sleeping with him.

612
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:29,793
Save it.
I saw the pictures.

613
00:31:29,827 --> 00:31:31,127
What pictures?

614
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,160
Just get in.

615
00:31:32,194 --> 00:31:34,494
I am not leaving!
Why the hell not?

616
00:31:34,527 --> 00:31:36,227
Because if I leave,
this will never end.

617
00:31:36,261 --> 00:31:38,060
What will never end?

618
00:31:38,094 --> 00:31:40,227
You do not understand.

619
00:31:40,261 --> 00:31:42,094
Then make me understand,
damn it!

620
00:31:42,127 --> 00:31:43,494
I don't think that I can.

621
00:31:43,527 --> 00:31:44,594
Try.

622
00:31:49,927 --> 00:31:51,628
Okay.

623
00:32:14,694 --> 00:32:17,494
(door slams)

624
00:32:17,527 --> 00:32:18,893
We don't have a lot of time.

625
00:32:18,927 --> 00:32:21,227
So you better start talking.

626
00:32:21,261 --> 00:32:23,827
(sighs)

627
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:28,327
My name is not Dana Walsh.

628
00:32:28,361 --> 00:32:30,361
It's Jenny Scott.

629
00:32:52,827 --> 00:32:53,961
Yes?

630
00:32:53,994 --> 00:32:54,961
You find Farhad?

631
00:32:54,994 --> 00:32:55,994
Still looking.

632
00:32:56,027 --> 00:32:58,027
I injured him badly.

633
00:32:58,061 --> 00:32:59,227
He won't get far.

634
00:32:59,261 --> 00:33:01,127
We don't know who he
might have contacted.

635
00:33:01,161 --> 00:33:03,493
I'll be traveling with the
rods to a secure location.

636
00:33:03,527 --> 00:33:04,794
Do you want me to come in?

637
00:33:04,827 --> 00:33:05,794
No.

638
00:33:05,827 --> 00:33:08,794
You stay here,
and you find him.

639
00:33:09,927 --> 00:33:11,627
(clattering)

640
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:12,994
(shouts)

641
00:33:27,261 --> 00:33:30,094
It's a six-acre warehouse
complex in Forest Hills.

642
00:33:30,127 --> 00:33:32,927
Farhad is somewhere
in one of these buildings.

643
00:33:32,961 --> 00:33:34,428
The rods must be there, too.

644
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:35,660
Drones are airborne,

645
00:33:35,694 --> 00:33:37,194
but they won't have eyes
for another 12 minutes.

646
00:33:37,227 --> 00:33:38,261
What about the police?

647
00:33:38,294 --> 00:33:39,428
They're redirecting
their resources,

648
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:41,394
but it's a big area--
it's gonna take

649
00:33:41,428 --> 00:33:43,361
a while to cordon off.
MAN:
Director Hastings.

00:33:43,394 --> 00:33:44,394
You wanted to see me, sir?

651
00:33:44,428 --> 00:33:46,760
In the absence of Agent Ortiz,

652
00:33:46,794 --> 00:33:49,394
I assume you're ready
to take charge of the operation.

653
00:33:49,428 --> 00:33:51,694
Yes, sir. Three
units standing by.
All right. I'll walk you out.

654
00:33:51,727 --> 00:33:55,061
There's a lot of pressure
on you, Agent Owen.
Oh, I can handle it, sir.

655
00:33:55,094 --> 00:33:57,361
All right, talk me through it.
What's the attack grid?

656
00:33:57,394 --> 00:33:58,994
Our working theory's
that the nuclear materials

657
00:33:59,027 --> 00:34:00,627
are still in the proximity
of Farhad.

658
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:02,027
Teams Alpha and Bravo are tasked

659
00:34:02,061 --> 00:34:03,527
with locating
and securing the rods.

660
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,827
What about Team Charlie?

661
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:06,927
They're responsible
for the actual evac, sir.

662
00:34:06,961 --> 00:34:08,660
It's a standard urban
search-and-rescue--

663
00:34:08,694 --> 00:34:09,994
we're in, we're out.

664
00:34:10,027 --> 00:34:12,361
Nothing standard
about it.

665
00:34:13,428 --> 00:34:15,827
Wait here.

666
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:17,261
Jack.

667
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,194
Jack.

668
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:24,593
You've got something
to say, say it.

669
00:34:24,627 --> 00:34:26,727
Think about it. The people
that are chasing Farhad

670
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,560
already know they've got
a big security problem,

671
00:34:28,593 --> 00:34:31,061
so most likely by the
time your men get there,

672
00:34:31,094 --> 00:34:32,727
those fuel rods
will be long gone.

673
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,527
And you're down to one
team covering Farhad?

674
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,094
What if they run
into resistance?

675
00:34:36,127 --> 00:34:37,460
What if they do?

676
00:34:37,493 --> 00:34:38,794
Well, at that point, you
start shooting at people

677
00:34:38,827 --> 00:34:40,027
that have a higher
intel value

678
00:34:40,061 --> 00:34:41,361
than the man you're
going to try and save.

679
00:34:41,394 --> 00:34:43,460
Agent Owen knows
the priority is to take

680
00:34:43,493 --> 00:34:44,493
all hostiles alive.

681
00:34:44,527 --> 00:34:45,794
Under fire?

682
00:34:45,827 --> 00:34:47,227
No assignment's more difficult.

683
00:34:47,261 --> 00:34:49,294
Agent Owen has
my full confidence.

684
00:34:50,328 --> 00:34:52,061
Yeah. If that were true,

685
00:34:52,094 --> 00:34:54,127
you wouldn't be standing
here talking to me.

686
00:34:55,794 --> 00:34:57,927
You offering
to bring in Farhad?

687
00:34:57,961 --> 00:35:00,927
Yes. If you drop the
criminal investigation

688
00:35:00,961 --> 00:35:02,961
against Renee Walker.

689
00:35:02,994 --> 00:35:06,428
Look, I know you don't
want to prosecute her.

690
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:08,328
I can be your out.

691
00:35:08,361 --> 00:35:12,061
I hear what you're saying,
but I can't help you, Jack.

692
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:16,294
I've sat in that
chair before.

693
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:20,127
The chair you're
sitting in now.

694
00:35:20,161 --> 00:35:21,627
I know what it's like.

695
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:23,361
There's a lot of
demands on you,

696
00:35:23,394 --> 00:35:25,261
many of them
unreasonable.

697
00:35:25,294 --> 00:35:29,560
But the people that last here,
the ones that mattered...

698
00:35:29,593 --> 00:35:31,760
they knew when to say no.

699
00:35:31,794 --> 00:35:34,460
It's the White House;
you don't say no.

700
00:35:34,493 --> 00:35:37,227
You are the head of CTU--
you've got

701
00:35:37,261 --> 00:35:39,127
a lot more juice
than you think.

702
00:35:39,161 --> 00:35:41,227
Especially with a
nuclear weapon in play.

703
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:48,161
If we do this, Jack, it's not
for one rescue operation.

704
00:35:48,194 --> 00:35:52,061
It's till this whole thing
is over and done.

705
00:35:52,094 --> 00:35:55,428
You want Renee freed up,
you're not in and out anymore.

706
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:58,027
I want you in with both feet.

707
00:36:05,161 --> 00:36:06,727
Deal.

708
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:09,294
Deal.

709
00:36:14,428 --> 00:36:16,961
I found an NYPD
evidence warehouse in Queens

710
00:36:16,994 --> 00:36:20,694
with $120,000 from a drug bust
just sitting there.

711
00:36:20,727 --> 00:36:24,460
It was only a matter
of getting them in and out

712
00:36:24,493 --> 00:36:25,894
between patrols.

713
00:36:25,927 --> 00:36:27,994
Wait, you actually
committed a robbery?

714
00:36:30,493 --> 00:36:33,061
Put yourself in my place, Cole.

715
00:36:33,094 --> 00:36:35,827
Kevin was going to tell Hastings
I'm a convicted felon.

716
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,694
He was going to ruin my life.

717
00:36:37,727 --> 00:36:38,994
What would you
have done?

718
00:36:39,027 --> 00:36:40,328
Not this.

719
00:36:42,428 --> 00:36:45,493
Kevin promised
that if I went along,

720
00:36:45,527 --> 00:36:47,493
he would never
bother me again.

721
00:36:47,527 --> 00:36:49,127
Let me guess.

722
00:36:49,161 --> 00:36:51,361
He didn't keep his end
of the bargain.

723
00:36:55,593 --> 00:36:58,061
That's why you're
here, isn't it?

724
00:36:59,961 --> 00:37:01,694
What do you mean?

725
00:37:01,727 --> 00:37:03,727
What's in your hand?

726
00:37:14,094 --> 00:37:15,593
You were going to kill them.

727
00:37:15,627 --> 00:37:17,860
I don't know
what I was going to do.

728
00:37:17,894 --> 00:37:19,860
You were going to shoot them
in cold blood.

729
00:37:19,894 --> 00:37:21,827
Cole, listen to me.

730
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:23,860
I was wrong.

731
00:37:23,894 --> 00:37:27,127
I see that now,
but I was scared.

732
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:28,894
I thought that I

733
00:37:28,927 --> 00:37:29,927
was doing this
for us.

734
00:37:29,961 --> 00:37:31,560
For us?
Are you out of your mind?

735
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:38,261
I love you, Cole.

736
00:37:39,894 --> 00:37:41,961
Don't say another word.

737
00:37:41,994 --> 00:37:44,261
Not one more word.

738
00:37:46,194 --> 00:37:48,027
Cole, where are you going? Cole!

739
00:37:48,061 --> 00:37:50,127
Stay in the truck.

740
00:37:50,161 --> 00:37:52,460
Cole, don't do this.

741
00:37:53,493 --> 00:37:54,660
Cole.

742
00:37:54,694 --> 00:37:55,961
Please, I am begging you.

743
00:37:55,994 --> 00:37:57,493
This is my problem, not yours.

744
00:37:57,527 --> 00:37:59,493
Stay back.

745
00:38:00,593 --> 00:38:02,394
What?

746
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:13,627
(coughing)

747
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:15,760
Hey, hey!

748
00:38:15,794 --> 00:38:17,328
COLE:
Yeah, go for it.
That way,

749
00:38:17,361 --> 00:38:19,194
I only have to deal
with one of you losers.

750
00:38:22,161 --> 00:38:24,161
I think you got
the wrong address, pal.

751
00:38:24,194 --> 00:38:25,560
Oh, do I?

752
00:38:25,593 --> 00:38:27,161
Somehow, I don't think so.

753
00:38:28,227 --> 00:38:29,527
Hey, maybe you should

754
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,927
just tell us
what it is you want.

755
00:38:30,961 --> 00:38:32,328
Maybe you should shut up
and listen.

756
00:38:32,361 --> 00:38:33,593
DANA:
Cole, please,
come on.

757
00:38:33,627 --> 00:38:34,760
Let's just get
out of here.

758
00:38:40,394 --> 00:38:42,127
I thought you looked familiar.

759
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:46,493
Looky here, Nick.

760
00:38:46,527 --> 00:38:48,694
It's soldier boy.
Mm-hmm.

761
00:38:48,727 --> 00:38:50,493
No kidding.

762
00:38:50,527 --> 00:38:52,961
You know, it's a shame

763
00:38:52,994 --> 00:38:55,328
that you and I can't
go grab a beer sometime.

764
00:38:55,361 --> 00:38:58,727
You know, just
the two of us.

765
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:01,560
I'm sure we'd have a lot
to talk about.

766
00:39:01,593 --> 00:39:03,994
I said shut up.

767
00:39:04,027 --> 00:39:07,794
Now, the way I see it,
you guys have two choices.

768
00:39:07,827 --> 00:39:09,961
One, you go back to prison

769
00:39:09,994 --> 00:39:12,794
for grand larceny and
aggravated assault.

770
00:39:12,827 --> 00:39:15,694
I go back to prison,
she goes back to prison.

771
00:39:16,727 --> 00:39:17,994
My guess is,
she's prepared

772
00:39:18,027 --> 00:39:19,227
to live with that.

773
00:39:21,161 --> 00:39:24,560
Choice number two:
I let you walk.

774
00:39:24,593 --> 00:39:26,727
You keep your
100 grand--

775
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,627
or what's
left of it--

776
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:32,161
and you go back to wherever
it is you came from.

777
00:39:33,361 --> 00:39:34,860
That's it?

778
00:39:34,894 --> 00:39:36,094
That's it.

779
00:39:36,127 --> 00:39:38,094
But if I
ever see you

780
00:39:38,127 --> 00:39:39,827
in this city again...

781
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:43,061
if I even hear
about you

782
00:39:43,094 --> 00:39:44,460
crossing the
state line,

783
00:39:44,493 --> 00:39:45,927
I'll skip the
formalities

784
00:39:45,961 --> 00:39:48,227
and kill you myself.

785
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,860
Do we have a deal or not?

786
00:39:56,194 --> 00:39:57,593
Yeah.

787
00:39:58,627 --> 00:40:00,694
We got a deal.

788
00:40:00,727 --> 00:40:02,994
Better be sure.

789
00:40:03,027 --> 00:40:04,827
I don't want to see

790
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:07,094
either one of
you ever again.

791
00:40:25,227 --> 00:40:27,061
Hey, what
are you doing?

792
00:40:27,094 --> 00:40:28,061
Going after him.

793
00:40:28,094 --> 00:40:29,527
Why?

794
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,194
Oh, we get rid of him,

795
00:40:31,227 --> 00:40:32,994
we're right back in business
with her.

796
00:40:33,027 --> 00:40:34,428
Come on, man.

797
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:36,760
We got what we came for.

798
00:40:36,794 --> 00:40:39,127
We got more.

799
00:40:39,161 --> 00:40:41,794
Now, let's just...
let's not push our luck.

800
00:40:41,827 --> 00:40:43,061
All right?

801
00:40:43,094 --> 00:40:44,361
Come on,
all right?

802
00:40:44,394 --> 00:40:45,627
We're just getting started.

803
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:50,860
We're done.

804
00:40:50,894 --> 00:40:52,428
Okay?

805
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:54,627
You got me?

806
00:40:56,328 --> 00:40:58,560
(groaning)

807
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,593
Cole.

808
00:41:05,627 --> 00:41:07,127
What you did back there,

809
00:41:07,161 --> 00:41:08,294
I'll never forget it.

810
00:41:08,328 --> 00:41:10,061
Let's just get back to CTU.

811
00:41:10,094 --> 00:41:12,194
