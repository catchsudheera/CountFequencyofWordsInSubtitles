1
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,320
I'd like you to appear on television and
appeal to members of Islamic communities.

2
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:22,313
Your cabinet feels
you're making a tragic mistake.

3
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,994
The man has murdered countless innocents

4
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:29,278
and you are putting your hopes
for this country's safety on him.

5
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:32,352
They will come after you.
I assure you of that.

6
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:35,398
We're talking about removing the president.

7
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,233
We are in a national crisis
and he is in over his head.

8
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,080
He's brought this on himself.
I need his itinerary,

9
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,199
specifically in regards
to Assad's televised address.

10
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,953
- Why?
- The less you know, the better.

11
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:52,953
Because of me, Fayed has a device that
can arm all the suitcase nukes he wants.

12
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,598
<i>(Chloe)</i> Don't blame yourself.

13
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,831
When the next bomb goes off
and thousands of more people die,

14
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,593
everybody will remember
I made it possible.

15
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:05,356
CTU found me. I needed to preoccupy them
with a bomb to enable my escape.

16
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:09,069
The delivery system software
was programmed for five detonations

17
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,116
at five high-priority targets.

18
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,192
Because of your carelessness,
we are now down to three.

19
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,475
More than enough for our needs, Gredenko.

20
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,152
Our country lost the Cold War

21
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,074
because it was afraid to use these weapons
against the Americans.

22
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:26,073
Today we will correct that mistake.
And the Arabs will take all the blame.

23
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,558
Marilyn, it is vital that we find Gredenko.

24
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:34,395
If we retrace the route you took that night,
do you think you'd recognise the house?

25
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,071
Maybe.

26
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,308
What's goin' on with you and Jack?

27
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,709
He's looking for someone.
He thinks I can help.

28
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,473
You mean Gredenko?
What do you know about him?

29
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,870
I followed Graem to a house one night.
He met with some Russians.

30
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,509
Jack wants to take me over there
to see if it can jog my memory.

31
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:55,071
You won't take Jack where Graem met
the Russians but to a different address.

32
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:58,914
Now, you do this for me,
and I promise you you will see Josh again.

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,116
If you don't, he dies.

34
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,629
Marilyn, is any of this familiar?

35
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,632
Yes. That's it - the blue house on the right.

36
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,039
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

37
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,754
Go, go!

38
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,237
Bomb! Everyone out!

39
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,717
Come on, come on. Move.
Go, go. Don't stop!

40
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,318
<i>- (phone rings)</i>
- Buchanan.

41
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,038
- It's Jack.
<i>- What do you got?</i>

42
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:54,193
We've been ambushed. The house that
Marilyn led us to was wired with explosives.

43
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:59,400
Half my team is down.
Send paramedics to 9407 Hindry Place.

44
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,516
- They knew we were coming.
- Gredenko?

45
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:07,197
I think so. I'm trying to find Milo and Marilyn.
I think they're being pursued by hostiles.

46
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,875
I'll have a team there.
I'll monitor local bandwidth.

47
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,349
Bill, hurry. We need to find them.

48
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,476
This way. This way, come on.

49
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,674
- Marilyn?
- I can't...

50
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,672
- We gotta keep moving. Move, move.
- I can't.

51
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,071
Come on.

52
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,116
Come on, this way.

53
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,672
<i>(man)</i> Over there. The other way.

54
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,795
<i>- (phone ringing)</i>
<i>- (woman on TV)... within miles of ground zero.</i>

55
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:10,396
<i>Survivors are being treated at local hospitals</i>
<i>and at makeshift medical facilities.</i>

56
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:16,157
<i>Local authorities continue to urge people</i>
<i>to stay in their homes until further notice...</i>

57
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,315
- Yeah.
<i>- We took out the CTU team.</i>

58
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,676
- So is my son dead?
- Yes, sir.

59
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,919
Right, well.

60
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,197
Had to be done.
Do you have Marilyn?

61
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,555
- No, sir, not yet.
<i>- Why not yet?</i>

62
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,200
She escaped with someone.
We're tracking them now.

63
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,269
Dammit.

64
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,115
We'll find her soon, sir. The man she's with
doesn't look like a trained field agent.

65
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:50,637
Make sure you take her alive. I need her
to find Gredenko so I can end this mess.

66
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,518
I understand.
I'll call you as soon as I have her.

67
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,112
<i>(thud)</i>

68
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,512
Ed.

69
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,916
They know we're here.

70
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,309
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

71
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,472
Marilyn, listen to me.
I'm gonna cover you.

72
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,676
When I do, head back towards the alley.

73
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:26,435
Run as fast and as far away from here
as you can. You understand me?

74
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,317
- Yeah.
- OK.

75
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,990
Targets are right behind us,
behind those dumpsters.

76
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,799
Remember, we need to take that woman alive.

77
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,995
Just wait. Wait till I tell you.

78
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,831
Go!

79
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,350
<i>(screeching)</i>

80
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,878
Let's go, let's go.

81
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,349
- I told you to go!
- I couldn't! Oh!

82
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,628
- Let's go.
- Wait, wait!

83
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,159
Kill him.

84
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,269
Drop your weapon!

85
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,999
- Let her go!
- Drop your weapon or I'll kill her.

86
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:26,074
If you wanted to kill her, she'd be dead
by now. Drop your weapon or I will use mine.

87
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,196
Do it!

88
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:38,676
On your knees! Hands on your head, interlace
your fingers. Turn around and face the fence.

89
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,880
Milo, let me see it.

90
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,393
<i>(moaning)</i>

91
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:51,439
There's no arterial bleeding.
You'll be OK. CTU will be here in a minute.

92
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,273
Take this gun, make sure he doesn't move.

93
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,028
That call you took was from Gredenko. You
tipped him off. Over half my team is dead!

94
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,874
- You don't understand!
- What, that Gredenko knew we were coming?

95
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,997
It wasn't Gredenko on the phone.
Those aren't his men.

96
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,392
If they weren't Gredenko's men,
whose were they? Who sent them?!

97
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,630
Your father.

98
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:22,114
- What are you talking about?
- It's true, Jack, I swear.

99
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,760
Your father called me in the car.

100
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,148
My father?

101
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,392
He told me to lead you to that house.
He said if I didn't, he'd...

102
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,909
He said that he killed Graem

103
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,151
and that if he had to, he would kill Josh.

104
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,231
I'm sorry.

105
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,234
He has my son!

106
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,879
Marilyn.

107
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:59,669
Do you have the address
to Gredenko's safe house?

108
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,193
Yes.

109
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:06,434
- I need you to give it to me now.
- I can't. Not till I have my son.

110
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:10,479
I will help you get Josh back,
but I need that address now.

111
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,348
Gredenko is our only chance
of recovering the nuclear weapons.

112
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:19,468
You saw what happened in Valencia
earlier today? This is going to be worse.

113
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,632
Please, just give me the address.

114
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:28,036
I recognised the house as we were driving.

115
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:31,669
It's on Glasgow - 9421.

116
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,313
Don't move.

117
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,477
<i>- (phone rings)</i>
- Buchanan.

118
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:43,951
I've got the correct address
for Gredenko's safe house - 9421 Glasgow.

119
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,429
Turner's team will be there. Run point.

120
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,318
I want you to send me
a smaller team to my location.

121
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:53,359
I'm at an industrial park on Pine,
just south of Oxford.

122
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,398
Have the team bring me a vehicle
with a full tactical kit.

123
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,711
They have to transfer Milo to CTU.
He's shot. It's not critical.

124
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:03,634
Divert the rest of the team to the address
on Glasgow to initiate attack.

125
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,950
Get back to me when you've got Gredenko.

126
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,554
- What's going on?
- I'll explain later.

127
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:13,111
- That's not good enough.
- Bill, please. Just trust me.

128
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,474
This is personal.

129
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,073
Jack!

130
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,117
How could I have been so stupid?

131
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,270
- Hi.
- Hey.

132
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,397
- Did you finish the vectors?
- No.

133
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,035
If you're having trouble,
I can help you.

134
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,872
I'm just not finished.

135
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:57,229
And I don't want this to turn into another
conversation about whether or not I'm OK.

136
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,311
I'm sorry, love.

137
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,836
If you can't talk to me,
talk to a staff psychologist or your sponsor.

138
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,309
I don't need them. I'll be fine.

139
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:09,791
We just heard from Jack. Marilyn Bauer
is safe. She gave us Gredenko's location.

140
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,872
- Milo was shot but he's gonna be OK.
- What happened?

141
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:17,670
He held off three armed hostiles till
Jack got there. He's up for a commendation.

142
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,832
Debrief him when Medical gives you the OK.

143
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:24,071
I will. Thanks for rubbing
that salt in the wounds.

144
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,549
- What?
- The nukes are armed cos I'm a coward.

145
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,872
And now you want me to listen to Milo
talk about what a bloody hero he is.

146
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,757
Coincidence?

147
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:36,719
- It'll be taken care of. Thanks.
- Taken care of.

148
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:42,594
We're coordinating the Gredenko operation.
TAC teams are moving in on his location.

149
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,671
I'll be right there.

150
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,030
I pushed you to work too soon.
Someone from District will relieve you.

151
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:55,513
They'll just make me feel worse. I need a few
minutes. I'll be fine. I'm gonna take a walk.

152
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,639
- I'll cover for you. Be back before we launch.
- Yeah, I will.

153
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,474
Give me the phone.
We need to make the call.

154
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,949
"Scramble caller" has to be enabled.

155
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,476
- Give us a second.
- Does he know where Phillip has Josh?

156
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:35,633
- No. I'll have to force my father's hand.
- Meaning what?

157
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:38,871
He'll call my father
and tell him he's apprehended you,

158
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:43,192
but you won't give him Gredenko's location
until he takes you to see your son.

159
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,554
What if Phillip refuses?

160
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,838
You have to stay firm. Say it's not
a negotiation, no matter what he threatens.

161
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,832
Jack, you're asking me
to put Josh's life at risk.

162
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,956
Josh's life <i>is</i> at risk.

163
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,476
My father won't give away his location
unless he thinks he has to.

164
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:01,269
Is that what this is about, finding Phillip?
Josh is secondary?

165
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,079
My father will have Josh with him.

166
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:09,272
Marilyn, I will do everything in my power
to make sure your son is safe.

167
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,916
How do you know he won't betray us?

168
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,354
He wants to live.

169
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,991
Let's go.

170
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:37,995
<i>(man on TV) As biohazard and hazmat units</i>
<i>make their way to the hot zone...</i>

171
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,832
You don't want to watch this.

172
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,354
You know, Josh.

173
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,590
Your father was very proud of you.

174
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,117
He'd tell me how blessed he felt

175
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:59,594
knowing everything he was working so hard
to build would be left in such good hands.

176
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:04,356
- Do we have to talk about this now, Grandpa?
- No, of course not.

177
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,509
He loved you very much.

178
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:16,910
Remember, I'll be able to hear both sides
of this conversation. You're set, dial.

179
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,956
<i>(phone rings)</i>

180
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,029
- Do you have her?
- Yeah.

181
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,554
But we took casualties.
I'm on my own now.

182
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:33,599
- You're getting a team to take out Gredenko?
- Yeah, I am.

183
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,672
She won't say where Gredenko is
until she sees her son.

184
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,311
Put her on.

185
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:50,116
- I did what you asked. Now, where's Josh?
- Marilyn, look.

186
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,112
I know you're frightened.
This doesn't have to end badly.

187
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:58,115
If you help me find Gredenko,
we can all survive this as a family.

188
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,988
I don't know what you're talking about.
I just want my son!

189
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:07,552
I'm just saying, you made your deal
with Graem, now make a deal with me.

190
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:12,839
With enough time, you and I and Josh
can rebuild whatever is left of this family.

191
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:19,557
After all, the legacy I'm trying to preserve
will someday be his. We can do this.

192
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,791
But first you have to tell me
where Gredenko is.

193
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,595
Only after this man takes me to see my son.

194
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,797
That will only complicate things.
I need Gredenko now.

195
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,271
<i>Tell me where he is.</i>

196
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,276
No.

197
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:43,075
You may have misunderstood my offer as
a sign of weakness, so let me make it clear.

198
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:47,950
If you do not help me,
I see no future for you or Josh.

199
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:52,591
I will walk into the next room
and I will kill him.

200
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:55,274
Right now.

201
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,799
Tell me... or Josh dies.

202
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:05,273
I will not tell you
what you want to know until I have my son!

203
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,033
Give him back the phone.

204
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:13,796
Yeah.

205
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:17,429
Bring her here to me
at the Grandmont Hotel, room 2132.

206
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,475
We're on our way.

207
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:24,869
We got the address. You did great.

208
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,358
Cuff him, put him in the back.

209
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,118
- Josh?
- Uh...

210
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:42,033
I'll go downstairs to get a soda.
You want anything?

211
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:45,635
- No, thanks. Did you look in the mini bar?
- Uh...

212
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,950
There wasn't anything that I wanted.

213
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:51,077
Why don't you call room service?

214
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,116
Well, I just feel like getting out.

215
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:03,032
Josh. Don't even think about it.

216
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:13,315
No one's life is worth the destruction
of everything I've built.

217
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,713
Now, step away from the door.

218
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,791
I was beginning to worry.

219
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:42,158
The meeting went long.
Here is the president's itinerary.

220
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,118
Oh, good. This will work.

221
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,636
- So when does all this happen?
- Now.

222
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:53,919
Authorise clearance for someone to get inside
the bunker. Once he's in, he'll carry the ball.

223
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,390
Carry the ball?
You mean kill the president.

224
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,153
I like to think we're beyond
doubting ourselves.

225
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,959
This president has endangered
the lives of millions.

226
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,157
You do not need to tell me
what the stakes are here.

227
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,632
- So who are we putting inside?
- A security specialist, private sector.

228
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,315
I requested that he advise my group
on several response options.

229
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,630
He has level-two clearance. Upgrade him.

230
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:23,919
- They will trace this thing right back to me.
- No, you won't even be investigated.

231
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,355
We have a cover.

232
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:29,432
- A cover? Who?
- Assad.

233
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,353
You're trying to make it look like he did this?

234
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:36,592
Just call in your authorisation code.
That's all the information you need.

235
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,875
<i>(phone rings)</i>

236
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,077
- Yeah, Dan?
- The president's asked to see you.

237
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,914
OK, tell the president
I will be with him in a moment.

238
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,275
Sir, our man will be here within the hour.

239
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,593
Call me when you're done with the president.

240
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,829
Oh, Tom, come in.

241
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:12,674
- You asked to see me?
- I'd like to hear your thoughts on something.

242
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,957
- My thoughts? On what, sir?
- Assad's speech.

243
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:21,068
He's going live in less than an hour. Before
I give him my thoughts, I wanted yours.

244
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,672
Is there a problem?

245
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:27,115
- No, sir. It's just...
- What?

246
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,152
I assumed you were no longer
interested in my opinions.

247
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,674
Tom, I still value yourjudgment.

248
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,230
And if I've made you
feel otherwise, I apologise.

249
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,959
All right, sir.

250
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,593
How much longer?

251
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:02,196
I'm not sure. I have to recalculate
the profile for two of the target cities.

252
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:05,875
Hurry. I don't want to be exposed like this
any longer than necessary.

253
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:09,475
You think the authorities know
we're working with Fayed?

254
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,630
If they don't, they will soon.

255
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,795

<i>It was so loud.</i>

- Yeah, you could say that.

261
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,071
- Can I get you anything else?
- No.

262

Yeah.

263
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,312
Whiskey, pint, single malt.

264
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,631
- What kind?
- That kind.

265
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,711
- This?
- Yeah.

266
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,277
- And these.
- OK.

267
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:04,392
- Wait, your change?
- Keep it.

268
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,438
<i>- I'm on my way.</i>
- From where?

269
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,556
I told you, I went out for a walk.

270
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,599
The TAC team is about to move in
on Gredenko. I need you at your station.

271
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:01,797
- I'm on my way.
- Morris...

272
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,797
Come with me.

273
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:36,236
I want you to put this on under your clothes.
It's just a precaution.

274
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,873
- My hands are shaking.
- Here.

275
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,873
I'm gonna do everything I can
to get him back.

276
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,997
He's the only reason I stayed with Graem.

277
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,878
He's the only good thing I have left since.

278
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,596
You ready?

279
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,511
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

280
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,038
Get out.

281
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,993
You do exactly what I tell you,
you understand me?

282
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,993
Let's go.

283
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,473
<i>(woman)</i> Agent Pressman,

284

you need to not exert too much pressure...

285

- Hey, Milo.
- Hey.

286
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:18,558
- How are you holding up?
- They say I'm gonna be OK.

287
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:25,274
It's... So, what happened?

288
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:29,638
I was stupid.
They don't pay me to be a field agent.

289
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:33,918
Maybe they should. You protected
Marilyn Bauer. That's what I heard.

290
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,514
I had no idea what I was doing.

291
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,068
The thing just happened so fast.

292
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:44,154
You don't have to downplay it to make me
feel better. You don't have to do that.

293
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:48,231
- OK.
- Yeah.

294
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,153
Hey. You OK?

00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,549
Yeah.

296
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:57,349
- Well done.
- Thanks.

297
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:06,195
We'll push Assad to make these changes.
Your suggestions are all excellent, Tom.

298
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:10,273
- Just doing my job.
- I'd like you to be there when he delivers this.

299
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:13,909
I will be. Excuse me,
I have a briefing with Senator Benson.

300
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,228
Of course, Tom.

301
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,398
Melinda, I have notes
that need to be taken to Assad.

302
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,472
<i>Yes, Mr President. I'll be right in.</i>

303
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,675
- What did he want?
- He asked me to review Assad's speech.

304
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:43,072
He'll never get the chance to deliver it.
You need to authorise that clearance.

305
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:47,392
- Our man will be here any minute.
- It's in the works. It's just taking a while.

306
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:50,438
- We need it before he's here.
- I will call Security again.

307
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:53,592
I'll call if there's a problem.
Go meet with him.

308
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,671
All right.

309
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,349
<i>(man) Operations.</i>

310
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:03,671
I need to speak to the ranking
Secret Service agent on site.

311
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,671
<i>- Yes.</i>
<i>- (man #2) Agent Hollister.</i>

312
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,354
This is Tom Lennox.
I need to see you immediately.

313
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:13,070
I can meet you as soon as I get someone
to man my position in about 15 minutes.

314
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:16,277
I've got something to show you.
Where are you right now?

315
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:19,397
<i>- B wing, room 17.</i>
- I'm on my way.

316
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:27,519
Carson wondered if you were playing us.
He didn't want to bring you into this.

317
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,309
But I said that we could trust you.
I told him that you understood!

318
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:36,394
- Nothing justifies killing the president.
- This president is giving us no choice.

319
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,040
- Don't do this.
- It's already done.

320
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,589
<i>- (man) Operations.</i>
- This is Reed Pollock.

321
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:01,478
I have a message
for Agent Hollister from Mr Lennox.

322
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:06,111
Tell him the issue has been resolved and
that Mr Lennox won't need to meet with him.

323
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,589
- I'll tell him.
<i>- OK, thanks.</i>

324
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,630
We confirmed the intel. The Glasgow house
is owned by a Russian shell corporation

325
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,995
that Gredenko has an interest in.

326
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:25,913
- Is Turner's team in place?
- They'll say when they're ready.

327
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,356
Chloe, lock the satellite
and establish a comm link.

328
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,395
Nadia.

329
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:35,796
- I told you not to take too long.
- Sorry.

330
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:43,032
- The backup module needs to be reset.
- Do it. The operation starts in two minutes.

331
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,111
Come with me.

332
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:59,478
Do you realise what a betrayal this is?

333
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:03,353
I was a little late.

334
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,637
Morris, I can smell it on your breath.

335
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,790
Yes, I took a drink.

336
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,110
But I spat it out straight away.

337
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,113
- Please.
- I swear. Chloe, look at me. Look at me.

338
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:19,192
I am stone-cold sober.

339
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:23,398
You're losing control.
You're placing other people's lives in danger.

340
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,989
I'm gonna have to tell Buchanan.

341
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:34,629
After everything that has happened.

342
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,553
Something had to give.

343
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:42,509
The important thing is that I realised
I didn't want to throw everything away.

344
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,751
Especially you, especially you.

345
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:54,231
And I stopped myself
and that is a little victory. Right?

346
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,913
I swear it will never happen again.

347
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:04,238
Don't tell Buchanan because you're right.
Me getting back to work is the best medicine.

348
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,471
- I'll be watching you for the rest of the shift.
- Fine.

349
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:12,552
- Call your sponsor.
- I will.

350
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:27,799
- Terrorist team is taking final positions.
- Chloe, open the video link.

351
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,791
Hal, what's your status?

352
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,108
No sign of a lookout.

353
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,875
- Windows are covered but we're good to go.
- Commence at your discretion.

354
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,155
- Ryan, is your team ready?
- Yes, sir.

355
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:41,518
OK, we're going in on three, two, one.

356
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,638
<i>Cover, cover.</i>

357
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,995
<i>- (man #1) Clear.</i>
<i>- (man #2) Clear.</i>

358
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:08,599
<i>- (man #3) Clear!</i>
<i>- (man #4) Clear.</i>

359
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,237
<i>- (man #5) Clear.</i>
<i>- (man #6) Clear.</i>

360
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,390
First sweep all clear, sir.

361
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,152
Roger that.

362
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:20,392
Mr Buchanan,
there's no sign of Gredenko or anyone.

363
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:24,157
Hal, when you complete the sweep,
process for evidence.

364
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,195
Yes, sir.

365
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:29,068
Chloe, text Jack's cellphone
and tell him we don't have Gredenko.

366
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,071
Open it.

367
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,754
Hold up here.

368
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:51,512
- What's wrong?
- It's nothing.

369
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,356
Don't think about warning my father.

370
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:58,877
Once he sees you brought me here, he's more
likely to shoot you than I am. Understand?

371
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:03,829
Both of you go up to the door. You knock.
When he lets you in, I'll follow. Let's go.

372
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,634
Marilyn, get back.

373
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:14,359
Open the door. Now, go.

374
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:37,077
- Where the hell is my father?
- I don't know. I swear.

375
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:41,039
- Where's Josh?
- Marilyn, just stay calm.

376
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,599
Put these on.

377
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,830
<i>(phone rings)</i>

378
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:47,388
Answer. Put it on speaker.

379
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:51,517
- Hello?
<i>- (Phillip) Hello, Marilyn.</i>

380
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:55,354
<i>Jack, even when you were young</i>
<i>I learned not to underestimate you.</i>

381
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,512
<i>I didn't want to hurt Josh.</i>
<i>You forced my hand.</i>

382
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,558
<i>Take a look out the window,</i>
<i>the adjacent roof.</i>

383
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,957
Oh, Phillip, please don't!

384
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:16,998
Dad, you only have one play left here - that's
to try and cut a deal with the government.

385
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:21,232
Explain your connection to the nuke
and that you'll help in exchange for immunity.

386
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:26,314
That is your only option. You pull that trigger
and that option is gone. Understand?

387
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:31,076
I'm no fool, Jack. They're never gonna
give me immunity after everything I've done.

388
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,469
You don't know that for sure!

389
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:38,509
Right now, they are desperate. But either way,
for you, this is over. Dad, it's over!

390
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:41,672
There is no empire to protect,
there's no legacy left.

391
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:45,150
There is Marilyn, Josh and me. That's it.

392
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,877
Please, Dad.

393
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:53,270
I know you don't want to hurt Josh.

394
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,396
I'm the one you want.

395
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:59,393
You let Josh go, I will surrender.

396
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,357
Come alone, unarmed, and I'll let Josh go.

397
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:11,319
But if you bring anyone else into this,
I will kill him.

398
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,391
I understand.

399
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,674
Hang up the phone.

400
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,315
<i>- (man) Field Ops.</i>
- This is Jack Bauer.

401
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:36,157
Send a team to the Grandmont Hotel to pick
up a hostile. He's secured. He's in room 2132.

402
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,229
<i>Right away.</i>

403
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,311
Jack.

404
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,518
This is our only chance.

405
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,831
Hey, I need to talk to you.

406
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,831
- About what?
- Morris.

407
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,717
- Not here.
- He came and saw me in the infirmary...

408
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:12,917
- I know he's been a little shaky.
- Has he been drinking?

409
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,594
- You smelled it on his breath?
- Yeah.

410
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:18,592
I did too. We talked.
He didn't metabolise the alcohol.

411
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:21,069
"He didn't metabolise the alcohol"?

412
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:24,118
It sounds weird, but it's true.
He spit it out.

413
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,509
- How do you know?
- Cos he told me.

414
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:30,275
- And you believe him?
- We were married. If he was drunk, I'd know.

415
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:33,238
He's not drunk.
He's been sober for three years.

416
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:40,678
- I didn't know he was an alcoholic.
- Now you know.

417
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,033
- You don't think Buchanan should know?
- No.

418
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:47,430
If he slips up again,
I will personally tell Buchanan.

419
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:50,592
Let's just leave it for now.

420
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,989
OK.

421
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:58,473
OK, I want you to wait here for Josh.

422
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:01,279
Do you think your father will keep his word?

423
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,635
If I keep mine.
You know how to use this?

424
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,836
- No.
- Point, hit, shoot.

425
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:09,037
Do you want me to call CTU
and tell them to send help?

426
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:11,998
No. I need to take care of this myself.

427
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:15,595
Jack... thank you.

428
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:23,709
Everything is gonna be all right.
Just wait here.

429
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:43,390
I'm unarmed!

430
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:08,198
Dad?

431
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,073
I'm unarmed.

432
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:17,032
- Come out. I am unarmed!
<i>- (Phillip)</i> That's close enough.

433
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,551
Turn around.

434
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:35,109
Now show me that you're not
wearing an ankle holster.

435
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:50,350
Take one step toward me
for every step Josh takes away.

436
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,553
Josh.

437
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,509
Slowly.

438
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:11,596
Your mother is waiting
in the stairwell. Go! Go!

439
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:20,468
That's it.

440
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:24,756
Oh, Josh! Oh, God!

441
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:28,198
Are you OK? Are you OK? Let's go. Go!

442
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:44,557
I never meant for this to happen, Jack.
I didn't have a choice.

443
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:51,711
I don't know how, but Gredenko found out
about my role in Palmer's assassination.

444
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:55,952
So he blackmailed me.
Forced me to cooperate.

445
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:02,393
So Gredenko had you divert the bombs your
company was responsible for destroying?

446
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,675
He's a radical nationalist.

447
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:07,479
Told me that he wanted to preserve arsenal

448
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:12,350
for the day when the Soviet Union
would be re-established.

449
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:15,480
I believed him because I had to.

450
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:20,714
- When did you know he sold them to Fayed?
- When the bomb was detonated in Valencia.

451
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:24,031
- That's the truth?
- Absolutely.

452
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,429
I've been looking for Gredenko ever since

453
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:31,910
so that I could find out
what he knew about Fayed and stop this.

454
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,879
I'm a patriot, Jack. I never wanted
any harm to come to this country.

455
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:39,316
You wanna lie to yourself, you go ahead.
But stop lying to me!

456
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:44,512
You let all of this happen
just so you could cover up what you did.

457
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,108
You have all the smarts
that Graem never had.

458
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:53,795
You'd have handled Gredenko
before this all got out of control.

459
00:37:53,880 --> 00:38:00,069
You know, none of this would have happened
if you hadn't turned your back on me.

460
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:05,473
So that you could become what?
A civil servant?

461
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:12,389
So your people will use Gredenko
to find this terrorist.

462
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:16,519
- The truth will come out about all I've done.
- We never got Gredenko.

463
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:21,353
Then all of this was for nothing.

464
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,273
On your knees.

465
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,278
It didn't have to end like this, Jack.

466
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,032
You could have had it all.

467
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,756
I want you to know...

468
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:46,436
I never wanted you to feel
like I had turned my back on you.

469
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:51,277
That I had turned my back on the family.

470
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:55,272
I just had to go my own way.

471
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,595
Do things for myself. I...

472
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,873
I was never good enough for you.

473
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,671
I'm sorry.

474
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,471
Anyway...

475
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,631
I'm ready.

476
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,914
What are you waiting for?

477
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,958
Do it! Damn you.

478
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,271
<i>(rings)</i>

479
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:09,791
Yes.

480
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:12,440
My name is Jack Bauer.
Who am I talking to?

481
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:15,512
<i>You must have exhausted</i>
<i>your options to find Gredenko.</i>

482
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,635
Who is this?

483
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,873
It's Charles Logan, Jack.

484
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,357
I might be able to help you but we need
to talk face-to-face. Where are you?

485
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:29,876
<i>- I'm near the airport.</i>
- Good. You're local.

486
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:32,633
CTU knows where I am.

487
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:37,396
Come and see me, Jack.
As soon as possible.

488
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:40,756
And come alone.
I'm looking forward to it.

489
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,471
