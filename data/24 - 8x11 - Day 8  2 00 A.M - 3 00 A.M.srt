00:00:13,567 --> 00:00:15,500
Cole, he's dead.

3
00:00:15,533 --> 00:00:18,067
Just go. Nobody knows you had
anything to do with this.

4
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:19,234
I don't want you involved.

5
00:00:19,267 --> 00:00:20,468
<i> I'm already involved.</i>

6
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,401
We're cleaning this up,

7
00:00:22,434 --> 00:00:24,134
and no one's never gonna
know what happened.

8
00:00:25,334 --> 00:00:27,334
They're scum, Dana,

9
00:00:27,368 --> 00:00:29,368
and no one's gonna miss 'em.

10
00:00:29,401 --> 00:00:31,067
Kayla may be in danger.

11
00:00:31,101 --> 00:00:32,234
She's run away.

12
00:00:32,267 --> 00:00:33,600
With Tarin.

13
00:00:33,633 --> 00:00:35,368
<i>She's somewhere in the city</i>

14
00:00:35,401 --> 00:00:37,201
with no idea that a
nuclear threat exists.

15
00:00:37,234 --> 00:00:38,368
And, Omar, what about you?

16
00:00:38,401 --> 00:00:39,700
Don't worry about me.

17
00:00:39,734 --> 00:00:42,368
<i>Just help me find our daughter.</i>

18
00:00:42,401 --> 00:00:44,067
Come inside.

19
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:48,334
They have the rods
you are looking for.

20
00:00:48,368 --> 00:00:49,834
I thought you had the rods.

21
00:00:49,867 --> 00:00:51,567
They turned against me.

22
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,267
<i>I can help you find them.</i>

23
00:00:53,301 --> 00:00:54,934
Just get me out of here.

24
00:00:54,967 --> 00:00:56,067
You find Farhad?

25
00:00:56,101 --> 00:00:57,234
Still looking.

26
00:00:57,267 --> 00:00:58,434
He won't get far.

27
00:01:03,633 --> 00:01:04,667
Medic! Come on! Medic!

28
00:01:05,667 --> 00:01:06,767
I need you to identify the men

29
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,867
who stole the nuclear
rods from you.

30
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,667
Can you do that for us? Yes.

31
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,034
Blood pressure's dropping.

32
00:01:11,067 --> 00:01:12,301
We got a rapid heartbeat.

33
00:01:12,334 --> 00:01:13,967
<i> We lost him. Farhad's dead.</i>

34
00:01:14,001 --> 00:01:15,301
Damn it!

35
00:01:15,334 --> 00:01:16,500
Whoever shot Farhad
couldn't confirm

36
00:01:16,533 --> 00:01:17,667
that he was killed.

37
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,368
I'm saying that we use
Farhad as dead bait.

38
00:01:19,401 --> 00:01:20,600
Leak it to the press

39
00:01:20,633 --> 00:01:22,201
that we've got him in custody,
and he survived,

40
00:01:22,234 --> 00:01:23,900
<i>and they'll have to make
a move on him.</i>

41
00:01:23,934 --> 00:01:25,434
Tell the support teams
it is imperative that

42
00:01:25,468 --> 00:01:26,700
we take these terrorists alive.

43
00:01:30,334 --> 00:01:31,700
Go! Go!

44
00:01:32,301 --> 00:01:33,633
It's all right.

45
00:01:33,667 --> 00:01:35,134
We just want to talk to you.

46
00:01:35,167 --> 00:01:36,533
No. No!

47
00:01:40,734 --> 00:01:41,700
He's still moving.

48
00:01:41,734 --> 00:01:42,700
Notify the perimeter.

49
00:01:53,368 --> 00:01:54,334
<i> It was a trap.</i>

50
00:01:54,368 --> 00:01:55,700
Farhad was already dead.

51
00:01:55,734 --> 00:01:57,600
I locked myself in some
kind of oxygen chamber.

52
00:01:57,633 --> 00:01:58,700
They can't get in here.

53
00:01:58,734 --> 00:02:00,134
You know what you must do.

54
00:02:00,167 --> 00:02:02,334
I can't. They scrambled
the arming code.

55
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:04,001
You need to set it off manually.

56
00:02:04,034 --> 00:02:05,900
You cannot let them take you alive.

57
00:02:08,667 --> 00:02:09,900
Can you hear me?

58
00:02:43,134 --> 00:02:44,533
What's the status?

59
00:02:44,567 --> 00:02:46,468
The hyperbaric chamber is
one-inch steel all around.

60
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,667
Hermetically sealed,
air and power systems are internal.

61
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,700
Also, its atmosphere is
most likely oxygen-enriched.

62
00:02:50,734 --> 00:02:53,700
Anything we use to blow the
door could ignite a fire inside.

63
00:02:53,734 --> 00:02:55,001
How long will it take to cut in?

64
00:02:55,034 --> 00:02:56,567
We need to use a low-speed
drill to avoid sparks.

65
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,800
How long?

66
00:02:57,834 --> 00:02:59,700
Best estimate- 40 minutes,
unless you want us

67
00:02:59,734 --> 00:03:01,101
to push the risk.

68
00:03:01,134 --> 00:03:02,633
I can't take the chance.
We need him alive.

69
00:03:02,667 --> 00:03:04,167
Agent Bauer, the techs have got
the internal cameras online.

70
00:03:04,201 --> 00:03:05,334
We have eyes on him.

71
00:03:05,368 --> 00:03:06,500
What about the intercom?

72
00:03:06,533 --> 00:03:07,633
The intercom's still down

73
00:03:07,667 --> 00:03:09,234
from when he shorted out
the locking mechanism.

74
00:03:09,267 --> 00:03:12,001
And the bomb techs say we
have a bigger problem. What?

75
00:03:12,034 --> 00:03:14,034
They assumed that once we jammed
the signal to the detonator,

76
00:03:14,067 --> 00:03:15,900
it'd be impossible for the
suspect to explode the vest.

77
00:03:15,934 --> 00:03:17,434
Turns out that may not be the case.

78
00:03:17,468 --> 00:03:18,667
He's reconfiguring the circuits.

79
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,167
Yeah. The detonator's

80
00:03:20,201 --> 00:03:22,267
German military,
so our guys are familiar with it.

81
00:03:22,301 --> 00:03:24,533
The end-around he's
sketched out here will work.

82
00:03:24,567 --> 00:03:25,667
What's the timeframe?

83
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,001
Well, it depends on
how fast he works.

84
00:03:27,034 --> 00:03:28,667
He needs to reset four circuits.

85
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:32,533
That LED light indicates
he's already completed one.

86
00:03:32,567 --> 00:03:33,700
When he wires the other three,

87
00:03:33,734 --> 00:03:35,468
he'll be able to explode
the device at will.

88
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,167
The only upside is the chamber
will contain the blast.

89
00:03:37,201 --> 00:03:38,334
No one else will be hurt.

90
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:39,667
He's not trying to hurt anybody.

91
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,434
He's trying to make sure
we don't take him alive.

92
00:03:41,468 --> 00:03:42,667
Get that intercom up and running.

93
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,468
I need to talk to him as
soon as possible. Sir.

94
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,600
This is Bauer.
Let me speak to Hastings.

95
00:03:52,967 --> 00:03:54,633
So, what have you got, Jack?

96
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:56,234
It looks like our suspect
might be able to get

97
00:03:56,267 --> 00:03:57,633
the detonator working
before we can get to him.

98
00:03:57,667 --> 00:03:59,101
Owen will fill you
in on the details.

99
00:03:59,134 --> 00:04:00,700
Right now, I need to know
everything you've got on him.

100
00:04:00,734 --> 00:04:02,368
I'm just pulling up the
information now, Jack.

101
00:04:02,401 --> 00:04:05,401
It took a while to get it from
Hassan's intelligence people.

102
00:04:05,434 --> 00:04:06,867
Just give me the overview.

103
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:10,034
Okay, Marcos Al-Zacar
was born here,

104
00:04:10,067 --> 00:04:11,334
raised in East Harlem.

105
00:04:11,368 --> 00:04:14,034
Mother's American,
father was from the IRK-

106
00:04:14,067 --> 00:04:16,201
that's where Al-Zacar
got his politics from.

107
00:04:16,234 --> 00:04:18,633
His father was a professor
known to be highly critical

108
00:04:18,667 --> 00:04:20,401
of American foreign policies,

109
00:04:20,434 --> 00:04:22,633
suspected of connections
with extremists.

110
00:04:22,667 --> 00:04:24,600
He was imprisoned by Wayne
Palmer's administration

111
00:04:24,633 --> 00:04:25,934
for four months.

112
00:04:25,967 --> 00:04:27,667
Although the charges
were eventually dropped,

113
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,434
he was unhireable after that.

114
00:04:29,468 --> 00:04:32,301
Almost a year later,
he committed suicide.

115
00:04:32,334 --> 00:04:33,900
That must have been
what triggered Al-Zacar.

116
00:04:33,934 --> 00:04:35,134
He started spying

117
00:04:35,167 --> 00:04:37,667
on America for the IRK
two months after that.

118
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,001
What about the mother?

119
00:04:39,034 --> 00:04:40,633
Checking current records.

120
00:04:40,667 --> 00:04:43,167
According to motor vehicle
and utility records

121
00:04:43,201 --> 00:04:44,301
she's still in East Harlem.

122
00:04:44,334 --> 00:04:46,468
4211 East 117th Street.

123
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,434
Find her and get her
here as soon as possible.

124
00:04:48,468 --> 00:04:50,167
We're on it, Jack. Keep us posted.

125
00:04:50,201 --> 00:04:52,234
Copy that.

126
00:04:52,267 --> 00:04:54,001
We have to assume the people
building this dirty bomb

127
00:04:54,034 --> 00:04:56,334
want to hit a high-value
target here in Manhattan.

128
00:04:56,368 --> 00:04:58,633
But first, they've got
to get it on the island.

129
00:04:58,667 --> 00:05:00,633
We should shut down the city? No.

130
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:02,101
We want them to make the attempt

131
00:05:02,134 --> 00:05:03,468
to move the radiological materials.

132
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,533
It's our best chance
of catching them.

133
00:05:05,567 --> 00:05:06,967
First, we have to make sure

134
00:05:07,001 --> 00:05:09,600
that all of our radiation
sensors are strictly monitored

135
00:05:09,633 --> 00:05:11,934
at all crossings.

136
00:05:11,967 --> 00:05:14,368
Arlo, that goes for the
drone sensors, too.

137
00:05:14,401 --> 00:05:15,633
Yes, sir.

138
00:05:15,667 --> 00:05:17,101
That's all.

139
00:05:30,401 --> 00:05:32,368
Cole?

140
00:05:32,401 --> 00:05:33,667
We went over this.

141
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,667
All we have to do is act natural.

142
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,234
Keep our heads.

143
00:05:37,267 --> 00:05:39,134
You'll be okay.

144
00:05:39,167 --> 00:05:42,034
I am not worried about me.

145
00:05:42,067 --> 00:05:45,334
You can't really be this calm
after what just happened.

146
00:05:45,368 --> 00:05:48,034
You've never broken
a law in your life.

147
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:52,468
Cole.

148
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,900
What do you want me to say?

149
00:05:53,934 --> 00:05:56,301
I don't know! Anything.
Tell me you hate me.

150
00:05:56,334 --> 00:05:58,567
Tell me that you'll never
forgive me for lying to you.

151
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,667
We're not doing this now.

152
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,334
I told you to walk away... Not now!

153
00:06:01,368 --> 00:06:03,067
We're in the middle

154
00:06:03,101 --> 00:06:04,500
of a radiological threat.

155
00:06:04,533 --> 00:06:06,368
We got jobs to do.

156
00:06:06,401 --> 00:06:09,234
When it's over, then we'll talk.

157
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:19,567
Look, I can't promise things are
going back to the way they were.

158
00:06:22,567 --> 00:06:25,034
But I wouldn't have done what I
did if I didn't still love you.

159
00:06:33,468 --> 00:06:36,633
You two have holy
hell to answer for.

160
00:06:36,667 --> 00:06:39,368
Sir, I'm sorry.
I can explain... Save it.

161
00:06:39,401 --> 00:06:41,167
If you were following up a lead,

162
00:06:41,201 --> 00:06:42,667
you should have been
updating me every 20 minutes.

163
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,101
You broke protocol.

164
00:06:44,134 --> 00:06:46,267
The lead didn't pan out.
Witness proved to be unreliable.

165
00:06:46,301 --> 00:06:47,667
But you're right, sir,
there's no excuse.

166
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,267
I should have called in.

167
00:06:49,301 --> 00:06:51,167
And you were supposed
to be servicing

168
00:06:51,201 --> 00:06:53,234
a faulty relay station.

169
00:06:53,267 --> 00:06:55,700
Yet I see you found time
to change your clothes.

170
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:58,667
Look.

171
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,401
I don't know what's
going on with you two

172
00:07:00,434 --> 00:07:01,567
and, frankly, I don't care.

173
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,134
If we weren't at high alert,

174
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:05,234
and you weren't the
best at what you do,

175
00:07:05,267 --> 00:07:07,600
you'd both be out on
your asses for this.

176
00:07:07,633 --> 00:07:10,567
I'm going to ask you once.

177
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,167
Whatever it is, are you finished?

178
00:07:13,201 --> 00:07:14,600
Yes, sir. Good.

179
00:07:14,633 --> 00:07:16,468
Walsh, until further notice,

180
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,267
you will answer to Chloe O'Brian.

181
00:07:18,301 --> 00:07:20,267
She will fill you in on
what she needs from you.

182
00:07:20,301 --> 00:07:22,633
Bauer has a situation at St.
Julian's Hospital.

183
00:07:22,667 --> 00:07:24,633
I need you to assemble
a team, pick up

184
00:07:24,667 --> 00:07:27,034
an Elaine Al-Zacar from East 117th

185
00:07:27,067 --> 00:07:28,500
and take her to him.

186
00:07:28,533 --> 00:07:30,567
Is she a hostile? Unclear.

187
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,167
Arlo will fill you
in on the details.

188
00:07:33,201 --> 00:07:34,633
Yes, sir. How you perform

189
00:07:34,667 --> 00:07:36,500
from this point will
determine whether or not

190
00:07:36,533 --> 00:07:38,600
you salvage your careers.

191
00:07:38,633 --> 00:07:40,667
Now, get to work.

192
00:08:11,134 --> 00:08:12,934
Yes?

193
00:08:12,967 --> 00:08:14,967
I'm in place.

194
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:23,633
I've managed to tap into the
hospital's security cameras.

195
00:08:23,667 --> 00:08:26,368
But we can only pick up audio
in the hallway outside the room.

196
00:08:26,401 --> 00:08:28,001
CTU has set up a
command center there.

197
00:08:28,034 --> 00:08:29,368
Can you see Marcos?

198
00:08:29,401 --> 00:08:32,167
Yes. He's still working
on the detonator.

199
00:08:32,201 --> 00:08:33,633
Are you able to gauge his progress?

200
00:08:33,667 --> 00:08:36,234
He already has one of the
four circuits reconfigured.

201
00:08:36,267 --> 00:08:38,633
We're arriving at the landing now.

202
00:08:38,667 --> 00:08:41,234
Soon we'll be able to transport
the rods into Manhattan.

203
00:08:41,267 --> 00:08:44,067
Are CTU's radiation sensors down?

204
00:08:44,101 --> 00:08:45,633
Not yet. But we'll be ready.

205
00:08:46,667 --> 00:08:48,633
Call me when Marcos is dead.

206
00:09:24,067 --> 00:09:26,134
Port Authority's reporting no hits

207
00:09:26,167 --> 00:09:27,800
on the radiation
sensors at the Holland,

208
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:29,534
Midtown and Lincoln Tunnels.

209
00:09:29,568 --> 00:09:32,067
I don't see any stream
updates for the GW,

210
00:09:32,101 --> 00:09:33,568
Brooklyn or Queens crossings.

211
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,700
What the problem?

212
00:09:34,733 --> 00:09:36,568
MTA's providing that feed

213
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,600
on a dedicated sublink to
prevent a server overload.

214
00:09:38,633 --> 00:09:41,534
You can access it yourself on
the system's Ethernet port.

215
00:09:41,568 --> 00:09:43,167
So there's really no problem.

216
00:09:43,201 --> 00:09:44,900
There's no way I
could have known that

217
00:09:44,934 --> 00:09:46,967
since you didn't put
that in your hourlies.

218
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,667
Right. I will do that next time.

219
00:09:58,434 --> 00:10:01,067
I know this must be hard for you,
having to report to me

220
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:02,600
since you've been demoted.

221
00:10:02,633 --> 00:10:04,167
It's okay, Chloe, I deserved it.

222
00:10:04,201 --> 00:10:05,934
Yeah, you did.

223
00:10:07,434 --> 00:10:10,468
I just want you to know I'm
actually glad you didn't get

224
00:10:10,501 --> 00:10:12,800
fired or anything and...

225
00:10:12,834 --> 00:10:14,201
Hang in there.

226
00:10:15,234 --> 00:10:17,167
Thank you. I appreciate that.

227
00:10:27,534 --> 00:10:29,600
Where are we on aerial detection?

228
00:10:29,633 --> 00:10:32,034
I've got drones covering
every inch of the waterfront

229
00:10:32,067 --> 00:10:34,468
with their radiation
detectors cranked up.

230
00:10:34,501 --> 00:10:36,201
If they try to bring the fuel rods

231
00:10:36,234 --> 00:10:38,000
into the city by boat,
we'll spot them.

232
00:10:38,034 --> 00:10:39,501
Easily.

233
00:10:41,534 --> 00:10:44,167
Look, I know you probably
hate my guts right now,

234
00:10:44,201 --> 00:10:46,667
but I just wanted you
to know that I'm sorry.

235
00:10:48,867 --> 00:10:51,534
For telling Cole about
you and that other guy.

236
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:53,867
I mean, you were definitely

237
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:56,234
messing up, and with the threat
of those rods out there...

238
00:10:56,267 --> 00:10:58,234
Don't worry about it, Arlo.

239
00:10:59,267 --> 00:11:01,501
So is he gone?

240
00:11:01,534 --> 00:11:03,867
Who?

241
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,167
You know.

242
00:11:05,201 --> 00:11:06,401
The other guy.

243
00:11:06,434 --> 00:11:08,900
Yeah.

244
00:11:08,934 --> 00:11:10,167
Yeah, he's gone.

245
00:11:11,434 --> 00:11:13,834
So, you and the Boy Scout are okay?

246
00:11:13,867 --> 00:11:16,167
We'll get through it.

247
00:11:17,201 --> 00:11:19,834
I'm glad.

248
00:11:19,867 --> 00:11:21,101
But if for some reason

249
00:11:21,134 --> 00:11:22,434
that changes... I know.

250
00:11:22,468 --> 00:11:24,568
Meaning, if you ever decide
you want to trade up...

251
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,468
I got it.

252
00:11:51,468 --> 00:11:53,134
Sir, we got the intercom
to the chamber working.

253
00:11:53,167 --> 00:11:54,568
You should be able to
talk to the suspect.

254
00:11:54,633 --> 00:11:57,633
Good. Tell CTU I'll keep my
comm up so they can monitor.

255
00:11:57,667 --> 00:11:58,667
Yes, sir.

256
00:12:19,434 --> 00:12:21,167
Marcos, my name is Jack Bauer.

257
00:12:21,201 --> 00:12:22,633
I'm working with CTU.

258
00:12:22,667 --> 00:12:25,000
I know the original plan was

259
00:12:25,034 --> 00:12:27,468
to smuggle the fuel rods back
to the IRK to reconstitute

260
00:12:27,501 --> 00:12:29,201
their nuclear program.

261
00:12:29,234 --> 00:12:31,101
So I'm just guessing

262
00:12:31,134 --> 00:12:33,201
that helping to deliver a
dirty bomb to New York City

263
00:12:33,234 --> 00:12:35,000
which will cost the lives
of tens of thousands

264
00:12:35,034 --> 00:12:37,767
of innocent people isn't
exactly what you signed on for.

265
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:41,434
But the truth is if you do this,
you'll be killing the IRK.

266
00:12:41,468 --> 00:12:43,534
By bombing New York City,
you're going to force

267
00:12:43,568 --> 00:12:46,633
President Taylor to retaliate,
and she will, hard.

268
00:12:46,667 --> 00:12:49,667
You can't possibly want that.

269
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,201
It doesn't matter what I want.

270
00:12:51,234 --> 00:12:53,568
This so-called peace agreement,
it's just Hassan

271
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,000
signing away my country's
ability to defend itself,

272
00:12:56,034 --> 00:12:58,201
its independence.

273
00:12:58,234 --> 00:13:00,034
He's surrendering without a fight.

274
00:13:00,067 --> 00:13:02,167
But there are a lot of
people in his own government

275
00:13:02,201 --> 00:13:04,000
who are not willing to do that.

276
00:13:04,034 --> 00:13:06,700
Marcos, you can't win this fight.

277
00:13:06,733 --> 00:13:10,167
The IRK will sustain massive
casualties because of this.

278
00:13:10,201 --> 00:13:11,633
Because of you.

279
00:13:11,667 --> 00:13:13,401
Not because of me.

280
00:13:13,434 --> 00:13:15,834
America will be the one
dropping all the bombs.

281
00:13:15,867 --> 00:13:17,534
No, son.

282
00:13:17,568 --> 00:13:19,167
The eyes of the world
will hold you responsible

283
00:13:19,201 --> 00:13:21,134
for the innocent lives
taken in New York City.

284
00:13:22,667 --> 00:13:25,534
No, don't think you can take
the moral high ground with me.

285
00:13:25,568 --> 00:13:28,134
The arrogance of this country.

286
00:13:28,167 --> 00:13:30,600
That it feels it can dictate
to the rest of the world

287
00:13:30,633 --> 00:13:33,534
who gets... who gets to
have nuclear weapons,

288
00:13:33,568 --> 00:13:36,934
while it insists on keeping
my people in the Dark Ages.

289
00:13:36,967 --> 00:13:38,934
You keep saying "your people,
your country."

290
00:13:38,967 --> 00:13:40,201
Marcos, I read your file.

291
00:13:40,234 --> 00:13:42,101
You were born here.
You're an American citizen.

292
00:13:42,134 --> 00:13:43,633
Your father is from the IRK.

293
00:13:43,667 --> 00:13:45,201
You leave my father out of this!

294
00:13:45,234 --> 00:13:47,534
What happened to your father
was unfair and tragic,

295
00:13:47,568 --> 00:13:49,600
but this is no way
to honor his memory.

296
00:13:49,633 --> 00:13:51,600
Please, you can still
do the right thing here.

297
00:13:51,633 --> 00:13:53,201
You can help me stop
this from happening.

298
00:13:53,234 --> 00:13:55,534
All you have to do
is open the door.

299
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:57,000
Please, I'm begging you.

300
00:13:57,034 --> 00:14:00,134
You're not going to get
me to change my mind.

301
00:14:00,167 --> 00:14:04,867
I came here prepared to die.

302
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:07,034
And that's what's going to happen.

303
00:14:09,101 --> 00:14:11,434
Marcos.

304
00:14:13,201 --> 00:14:15,101
Marcos.

305
00:14:15,134 --> 00:14:16,867
Please, just talk to me.

306
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,434
Marcos!

307
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,600
Marcos!

308
00:14:48,834 --> 00:14:51,368
Yes, of course. I understand.

309
00:14:52,417 --> 00:14:53,850
We'll see you soon.

310
00:14:53,883 --> 00:14:55,050
Thank you.

311
00:14:57,117 --> 00:14:58,984
Your friend at the
State Department-

312
00:14:59,017 --> 00:15:00,750
you trust he can do what he says,

313
00:15:00,783 --> 00:15:02,651
give us asylum?

314
00:15:02,684 --> 00:15:04,351
Yes.

315
00:15:04,384 --> 00:15:06,984
He says with what your
father has been doing-

316
00:15:07,017 --> 00:15:10,451
ordering unlawful
arrest and torture-

317
00:15:10,484 --> 00:15:13,150
U.S. law will consider
us political refugees.

318
00:15:14,718 --> 00:15:16,850
But you have to understand,

319
00:15:16,883 --> 00:15:19,417
asylum will not be
granted overnight.

320
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:21,551
Well, how long are
we talking about?

321
00:15:21,584 --> 00:15:24,451
A year, maybe 18 months.

322
00:15:24,484 --> 00:15:26,783
But as soon as we
file the application,

323
00:15:26,817 --> 00:15:28,084
we are protected by the law.

324
00:15:28,117 --> 00:15:29,783
Your father cannot touch us.

325
00:15:31,883 --> 00:15:34,084
You know that I will not be
able to work here legally

326
00:15:34,117 --> 00:15:36,984
until asylum has been granted.

327
00:15:37,017 --> 00:15:39,950
I have some savings.

328
00:15:39,984 --> 00:15:42,351
But I will not be able

329
00:15:42,384 --> 00:15:45,017
to give you the life that
you have been used to.

330
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:48,017
Oh, you know I don't
care about any of that.

331
00:15:56,718 --> 00:15:58,984
One minute.

332
00:16:00,718 --> 00:16:03,817
Oh... my mother again.

333
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:07,017
I really should answer it. Kayla.

334
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:09,150
No, she deserves to
know I'm all right.

335
00:16:10,984 --> 00:16:12,384
Give that back to me!

336
00:16:12,417 --> 00:16:15,150
Please. You know what?
You can call her

337
00:16:15,184 --> 00:16:18,618
when the lawyer has
filed the application.

338
00:16:18,651 --> 00:16:20,150
We must wait until then.

339
00:16:20,184 --> 00:16:22,084
Bye-bye.

340
00:16:24,184 --> 00:16:26,551
Kayla, it's me again.

341
00:16:26,584 --> 00:16:28,117
Darling, I need to talk to you.

342
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:29,750
Your father told me
something terrible

343
00:16:29,783 --> 00:16:31,718
may be happening here in New York.

344
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,150
Please, call me back as soon as you

345
00:16:33,184 --> 00:16:35,017
get this message.

346
00:16:43,184 --> 00:16:44,551
I still can't reach her.

347
00:16:44,584 --> 00:16:46,150
Thank you for coming back.

348
00:16:46,184 --> 00:16:47,718
Our daughter is missing.

349
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,484
I'm not leaving until I
know she's all right.

350
00:16:49,517 --> 00:16:50,850
We'll find her, Dalia.

351
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:55,551
Nabeel told me you
had Tarin arrested.

352
00:16:57,718 --> 00:17:00,351
I didn't know who I could trust.

353
00:17:00,384 --> 00:17:04,117
So you started arresting people
from inside your own delegation?

354
00:17:05,718 --> 00:17:08,451
What possible evidence could
you have gathered so quickly?

355
00:17:08,484 --> 00:17:10,451
I had to do something. But Tarin?

356
00:17:11,917 --> 00:17:14,084
He's one of your most loyal men.

357
00:17:14,117 --> 00:17:16,684
So was my brother.

358
00:17:16,718 --> 00:17:18,384
Or so I thought.

359
00:17:18,417 --> 00:17:20,317
Until he tried

360
00:17:20,351 --> 00:17:22,684
to have me killed and
destroy my government.

361
00:17:22,718 --> 00:17:24,384
If you continue to act
the way you have been,

362
00:17:24,417 --> 00:17:26,517
you will have done the job for him.

363
00:17:29,917 --> 00:17:31,917
Have you told the police?

364
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,984
I've been trying to
deal with it on my own.

365
00:17:34,017 --> 00:17:36,150
But it's time to get them involved.

366
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:00,651
Dalia, I'm sorry.

367
00:18:00,684 --> 00:18:01,950
As you should be!

368
00:18:01,984 --> 00:18:03,618
This city is under attack!

369
00:18:03,651 --> 00:18:05,783
Our daughter is god knows where!

370
00:18:07,517 --> 00:18:10,783
You drove her away
with your suspicion

371
00:18:10,817 --> 00:18:12,883
and your paranoia!

372
00:18:14,917 --> 00:18:17,950
How could you, Omar?

373
00:18:19,517 --> 00:18:22,783
How could you have lost your way?

374
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:28,084
Dalia.

375
00:18:28,117 --> 00:18:29,950
You're right.

376
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:32,117
I have.

377
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:34,917
I have. I see that now.

378
00:18:36,384 --> 00:18:38,351
And I'll make changes.

379
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:41,150
I'll do everything in my power

380
00:18:41,883 --> 00:18:43,451
to find her.

381
00:18:44,517 --> 00:18:46,984
And get her safe.

382
00:18:48,017 --> 00:18:50,150
You have my word.

383
00:18:51,718 --> 00:18:53,718
I am sorry.

384
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:57,050
Dalia, I'm sorry.

385
00:19:17,783 --> 00:19:18,917
Who is it?

386
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:20,917
Elaine Al-Zacar?

387
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:22,084
What do you want?

388
00:19:22,117 --> 00:19:23,417
My name is Cole Ortiz.

389
00:19:23,451 --> 00:19:24,750
I'm an agent with CTU.

390
00:19:24,783 --> 00:19:26,651
I need you to open
that door, ma'am.

391
00:19:26,684 --> 00:19:28,317
I don't understand.
What's this about?

392
00:19:28,351 --> 00:19:29,917
Your son, Marcos.

393
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:31,251
Marcos?

394
00:19:31,284 --> 00:19:32,883
Ma'am, you're either
going to open that door

395
00:19:32,917 --> 00:19:34,718
or I'm gonna break it down. Now!

396
00:19:35,783 --> 00:19:38,017
Go!

397
00:19:41,417 --> 00:19:44,017
Mrs. Al-Zacar, are you aware
of where your son is right now?

398
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:46,050
Not at the moment.
How much do you know

399
00:19:46,084 --> 00:19:47,384
about his activities on behalf

400
00:19:47,417 --> 00:19:49,750
of the IRK? Uh...

401
00:19:50,917 --> 00:19:52,517
I know that he

402
00:19:52,551 --> 00:19:54,817
communicates with family there,
if that's what you mean.

403
00:19:58,050 --> 00:19:59,417
You going somewhere?

404
00:19:59,451 --> 00:20:02,783
I was just about to leave
to my sister's house.

405
00:20:02,817 --> 00:20:03,984
You do that a lot, take trips

406
00:20:04,017 --> 00:20:05,684
to visit relatives at 2:
30 in the morning?

407
00:20:05,718 --> 00:20:07,850
No, I don't. I can explain.

408
00:20:07,883 --> 00:20:10,883
Marcos called me about an hour ago.

409
00:20:10,917 --> 00:20:12,817
He told me to leave the city.

410
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:14,484
He said he needed me to meet him

411
00:20:14,517 --> 00:20:16,783
at my sister's house
in Pennsylvania.

412
00:20:16,817 --> 00:20:18,817
He didn't tell you
anything else? No.

413
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:21,950
I swear.

414
00:20:21,984 --> 00:20:23,551
Ma'am, right now your son's

415
00:20:23,584 --> 00:20:25,084
barricaded himself at St.
Julian's Hospital,

416
00:20:25,117 --> 00:20:27,850
trying to blow himself
up with a suicide vest.

417
00:20:27,883 --> 00:20:30,150
Oh, my God. No!

418
00:20:30,184 --> 00:20:32,084
I need you to come with me to St.
Julian's- ma'am.

419
00:20:32,117 --> 00:20:34,750
We don't know how much longer we
have till your son can activate

420
00:20:34,783 --> 00:20:36,384
the explosives; we have to go.

421
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,434
Yes?

422
00:20:53,434 --> 00:20:55,068
Sir, Cole just checked in.

423
00:20:55,101 --> 00:20:56,701
He's got Al-Zacar's
mother and he's en route

424
00:20:56,734 --> 00:20:58,333
to St. Julian's now.
What's his ETA?

425
00:20:58,367 --> 00:21:00,168
Less than ten minutes.

426
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,200
All right, then. Thank you.

427
00:21:02,233 --> 00:21:05,101
Sir, I would like
to apologize again

428
00:21:05,134 --> 00:21:07,333
for leaving my post.
I know that I let you down.

429
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:11,134
Yes, you did.

430
00:21:11,168 --> 00:21:14,333
I brought you in and
gave you this promotion

431
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:16,333
because I saw something in you,
not just your skill,

432
00:21:16,367 --> 00:21:19,333
which is considerable.

433
00:21:19,367 --> 00:21:23,034
But an ability to adapt
to any situation,

434
00:21:23,068 --> 00:21:24,901
drive to be better,

435
00:21:24,934 --> 00:21:26,367
attributes that make
you a good leader.

436
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,834
Or did I misread that?

437
00:21:27,867 --> 00:21:29,701
No, sir.

438
00:21:29,734 --> 00:21:31,367
So we can chalk up the
last several hours

439
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,367
to a serious lapse in judgment?

440
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,367
What I was... Look.

441
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,134
I don't want to lose you or Cole.

442
00:21:38,168 --> 00:21:40,701
You're both valuable,

443
00:21:40,734 --> 00:21:42,267
but everyone is replaceable.

444
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,367
I screwed up and I'm willing

445
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,734
to accept the consequences.

446
00:21:45,767 --> 00:21:48,168
I know that Cole
feels the same way.

447
00:21:52,367 --> 00:21:53,867
Thank you, sir.

448
00:21:58,034 --> 00:21:59,300
Hello?

449
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:00,801
Can I ask who I'm speaking with?

450
00:22:00,834 --> 00:22:02,233
Excuse me?

451
00:22:02,267 --> 00:22:04,233
Would you mind telling
me your name, please?

452
00:22:04,267 --> 00:22:06,101
This is Dana Walsh. Who is this?

453
00:22:06,134 --> 00:22:10,001
Forgive me, Miss Walsh,
for calling at this ungodly hour.

454
00:22:10,034 --> 00:22:12,233
I actually expected
to leave a message.

455
00:22:12,267 --> 00:22:13,701
I'm sorry if I woke you.

456
00:22:13,734 --> 00:22:16,134
No, no, that's okay.
I'm actually at work.

457
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,701
What is this regarding?

458
00:22:17,734 --> 00:22:20,300
Well, my name's Prady.
I'm with the Department of Corrections

459
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:21,801
down in Little Rock.

460
00:22:21,834 --> 00:22:23,600
I'm trying to locate an individual

461
00:22:23,634 --> 00:22:26,734
by the name of Kevin Wade.

462
00:22:28,834 --> 00:22:29,967
I- I'm sorry.

463
00:22:30,001 --> 00:22:31,967
Who did you say
that you were again?

464
00:22:32,001 --> 00:22:34,300
Bill Prady.
I'm a probation officer.

465
00:22:34,333 --> 00:22:35,734
Mr. Wade is one of my charges.

466
00:22:35,767 --> 00:22:37,233
Do you know him?

467
00:22:37,267 --> 00:22:39,701
No, no. I don't think that I do.

468
00:22:39,734 --> 00:22:41,901
Well, that's peculiar since
he dialed this number

469
00:22:41,934 --> 00:22:45,333
a few days ago from a
motel room in Queens.

470
00:22:45,367 --> 00:22:46,734
Probably just a misdial.

471
00:22:46,767 --> 00:22:49,233
No. Dialed this
number more than once,

472
00:22:49,267 --> 00:22:52,001
and some of the calls lasted
more than a couple of minutes.

473
00:22:52,034 --> 00:22:53,634
Look, Mr. Prady,
I am really busy right now.

474
00:22:53,667 --> 00:22:56,867
I work for CTU and we are
in the middle of a crisis.

475
00:22:56,901 --> 00:22:59,101
Well, I completely understand.
I've heard the news.

476
00:22:59,134 --> 00:23:00,300
But since we're both awake,

477
00:23:00,333 --> 00:23:03,934
I wonder if I could
meet with you in person.

478
00:23:03,967 --> 00:23:05,400
You mean now?

479
00:23:05,434 --> 00:23:08,300
Well, I got an early flight
to Little Rock in the morning,

480
00:23:08,333 --> 00:23:10,567
so, yeah, it'd pretty much
have to be now, ma'am.

481
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:13,168
I'm sorry. I-
I don't really understand

482
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,867
why this is so pressing.

483
00:23:14,901 --> 00:23:17,300
Well, Miss Walsh,
I've grown kind of fond

484
00:23:17,333 --> 00:23:20,801
of young Kevin, and the longer
it takes me to find him,

485
00:23:20,834 --> 00:23:23,300
the harder it'll be for me

486
00:23:23,333 --> 00:23:24,967
to keep him from going
back into prison.

487
00:23:25,001 --> 00:23:27,068
I don't really see how
I can be of any help.

488
00:23:27,101 --> 00:23:28,801
Yeah, well, maybe not.

489
00:23:28,834 --> 00:23:30,734
But we can determine
that when we speak.

490
00:23:30,767 --> 00:23:33,068
Like I said, it won't take long.

491
00:23:35,367 --> 00:23:37,767
Look, if it'll smooth things over,

492
00:23:37,801 --> 00:23:39,300
I could call your supervisor.

493
00:23:39,333 --> 00:23:41,767
No, no. That won't be necessary.

494
00:23:41,801 --> 00:23:44,168
I'm sure that I could spare
a few minutes for you.

495
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,034
Thank you, ma'am.
That would be super.

496
00:23:46,068 --> 00:23:48,233
Tell you what.
Let me just pull over,

497
00:23:48,267 --> 00:23:50,001
and I'll get your address.
All right?

498
00:23:51,934 --> 00:23:53,634
Of course.

499
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,867
Sir, according to the bomb techs,
he's close.

500
00:24:15,901 --> 00:24:17,567
Getting that third circuit
active was the toughest part.

501
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,168
The fourth is only a matter of
rerouting the firing circuits.

502
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,300
What's the time frame?

503
00:24:21,333 --> 00:24:22,767
Ten minutes, maybe less.

504
00:24:22,801 --> 00:24:24,701
How much longer is it going
to take them to drill through?

505
00:24:24,734 --> 00:24:26,300
Too long. They're not
going to make it.

506
00:24:26,333 --> 00:24:28,300
Get her some water.

507
00:24:29,333 --> 00:24:31,300
Take care of that.

508
00:24:34,168 --> 00:24:35,300
Did she resist?

509
00:24:35,333 --> 00:24:37,001
Not once I told her
her boy had explosives

510
00:24:37,034 --> 00:24:38,667
strapped to him and was
going to blow himself up.

511
00:24:38,701 --> 00:24:41,034
She had a packed suitcase, Jack.

512
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,767
So he cares enough about her

513
00:24:44,801 --> 00:24:46,867
to make sure she got out of town.

514
00:24:46,901 --> 00:24:48,034
What else does she know?

515
00:24:48,068 --> 00:24:49,233
Nothing, as far as I can tell.

516
00:24:49,267 --> 00:24:50,233
And I didn't tell
her anything more.

517
00:24:50,267 --> 00:24:51,934
Okay, good.

518
00:24:56,168 --> 00:24:57,734
Mrs. Al-Zacar,
my name is Jack Bauer.

519
00:24:57,767 --> 00:24:59,200
I'm in charge of field
operations here.

520
00:24:59,233 --> 00:25:00,567
Where is he? I'm going
to take you to him.

521
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,233
I want to see him.
I'm going to take you to him.

522
00:25:02,267 --> 00:25:04,901
Please sit down. I need you to
fully understand the situation.

523
00:25:04,934 --> 00:25:07,168
Please.

524
00:25:10,834 --> 00:25:13,233
This is Ortiz.

525
00:25:13,267 --> 00:25:14,801
Cole, it's me.

526
00:25:14,834 --> 00:25:17,300
Kevin's probation
officer just called me.

527
00:25:17,333 --> 00:25:20,034
He's in New York,
trying to track down Kevin.

528
00:25:20,068 --> 00:25:21,300
I can't talk to you about this now.

529
00:25:21,333 --> 00:25:22,767
We're in the middle here.

530
00:25:22,801 --> 00:25:25,567
Listen to me. I told him I
didn't know who Kevin was,

531
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,300
but... he caught me in the lie.

532
00:25:28,333 --> 00:25:32,767
He has records that show him
calling my cell several times.

533
00:25:34,333 --> 00:25:38,934
Cole, this probation
officer is on his way here.

534
00:25:38,967 --> 00:25:40,567
Look, you're going to have
to figure out a reason

535
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,767
why he had your number.

536
00:25:41,801 --> 00:25:44,233
I don't know if I can do this.

537
00:25:44,267 --> 00:25:46,600
What, lie? Come on,
we both know you're good at it.

538
00:25:47,701 --> 00:25:49,333
Sorry.

539
00:25:49,367 --> 00:25:51,701
Look, you just have
to handle this. Okay?

540
00:25:51,734 --> 00:25:53,134
All right?

541
00:25:53,168 --> 00:25:54,667
Yeah.

542
00:25:54,701 --> 00:25:55,867
Let me know what happens.

543
00:25:55,901 --> 00:25:57,068
I got to go.

544
00:26:01,834 --> 00:26:03,267
I can't believe this is happening.

545
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,634
You need to believe it.

546
00:26:04,667 --> 00:26:06,168
The men your son is working with

547
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,934
intend on detonating
a radiological bomb

548
00:26:07,967 --> 00:26:09,267
somewhere in Manhattan.

549
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,034
That's why your son tried
to get you out of the city.

550
00:26:12,233 --> 00:26:14,134
Marcos has been an
agent for the IRK,

551
00:26:14,168 --> 00:26:15,801
spying on this country
since your husband died.

552
00:26:15,834 --> 00:26:18,233
We have proof of that.

553
00:26:18,267 --> 00:26:19,267
And now he's going to kill himself

554
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:20,734
in order to protect this plot

555
00:26:20,767 --> 00:26:22,534
unless you can
convince him otherwise.

556
00:26:22,567 --> 00:26:25,300
What do-what do I say to him?

557
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:26,767
Whatever you have to,

558
00:26:26,801 --> 00:26:29,634
to get him to stop rearming that vest,
and open the door.

559
00:26:29,667 --> 00:26:31,300
We need him to open the door.

560
00:26:31,333 --> 00:26:32,701
Do you understand?

561
00:26:34,333 --> 00:26:38,168
If he does that,

562
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,200
then what happens to him?

563
00:26:40,233 --> 00:26:42,001
He'll be alive.

564
00:26:42,034 --> 00:26:44,300
If he cooperates with us,
I promise you,

565
00:26:44,333 --> 00:26:46,034
I will do everything
I can to help him.

566
00:26:46,068 --> 00:26:47,634
I give you my word.

567
00:26:50,333 --> 00:26:53,600
Ma'am, I'm sorry,
but we need to do this now.

568
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:09,667
We need the room.

569
00:27:09,701 --> 00:27:12,200
Now.

570
00:27:21,901 --> 00:27:23,734
It's definitely her.

571
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:25,267
Marcos's mother.

572
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:27,068
You recruited him, Ali.

573
00:27:27,101 --> 00:27:28,267
You know him better than anyone.

574
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:30,300
Will she be able to talk him down?

575
00:27:30,333 --> 00:27:32,834
He's loyal to our country.

576
00:27:32,867 --> 00:27:34,101
I don't think so.

577
00:27:41,068 --> 00:27:43,567
ELAINE Marcos?

578
00:27:45,901 --> 00:27:49,200
Marcos, it's me.

579
00:27:51,267 --> 00:27:53,101
Mom, what are you doing here?

580
00:27:53,134 --> 00:27:54,934
Marcos, you have to stop this.

581
00:27:54,967 --> 00:27:56,667
This is crazy.

582
00:27:56,701 --> 00:27:58,767
You son of a bitch!

583
00:27:58,801 --> 00:28:01,267
Leave us alone!

584
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:03,233
You leave us alone!

585
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,134
Marcos, talk to me.

586
00:28:11,168 --> 00:28:13,867
Oh, my God, Mom. I told you
to get out of the city.

587
00:28:13,901 --> 00:28:15,233
I told you to go to Aunt Shelley's.

588
00:28:15,267 --> 00:28:16,734
Why didn't you listen to me?

589
00:28:16,767 --> 00:28:18,267
I'm listening now.

590
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,967
You told me that you were
going to meet me there.

591
00:28:20,001 --> 00:28:21,134
I believed you.

592
00:28:21,168 --> 00:28:22,867
I was trying to protect you.

593
00:28:22,901 --> 00:28:24,867
From a terrorist attack?

594
00:28:24,901 --> 00:28:28,801
That's what they say that
you're involved in here.

595
00:28:28,834 --> 00:28:31,267
Something that's going to
kill many, many people.

596
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:33,667
Marcos, tell me that's not true!

597
00:28:35,001 --> 00:28:38,834
Tell me!

598
00:28:38,867 --> 00:28:40,734
Marcos, why?

599
00:28:40,767 --> 00:28:43,034
You ask me that?

600
00:28:43,068 --> 00:28:45,667
After what this country did to Dad?

601
00:28:49,667 --> 00:28:52,701
Marcos, I loved your father.
You know I did.

602
00:28:55,267 --> 00:28:56,701
But he was a complicated man,

603
00:28:56,734 --> 00:28:58,967
and especially when it
came to his politics.

604
00:29:00,333 --> 00:29:03,068
But he never condoned
violence of any kind, Marcos.

605
00:29:03,101 --> 00:29:04,233
Never.

606
00:29:04,267 --> 00:29:06,901
He would agree with
what we're doing.

607
00:29:06,934 --> 00:29:09,534
You really think that?

608
00:29:09,567 --> 00:29:11,267
He hated America.

609
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:12,834
And yet he came to America.

610
00:29:12,867 --> 00:29:14,200
He married an American.

611
00:29:14,233 --> 00:29:16,534
He had an American son.

612
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:22,134
Honey, nothing is as simple
as you're making it out to be.

613
00:29:22,168 --> 00:29:24,267
Mr. Hastings.

614
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:26,600
I've registered a 12%
degradation in the hospital's

615
00:29:26,634 --> 00:29:28,134
security feed.

616
00:29:28,168 --> 00:29:29,233
Can you boost the signal?

617
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:30,634
You're missing the point.

618
00:29:30,667 --> 00:29:33,101
The indications are someone's
tapped into the feed.

619
00:29:33,134 --> 00:29:36,300
They can see everything we can.

620
00:29:39,001 --> 00:29:40,267
I wish I'd done more.

621
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:43,801
I wish I'd helped you

622
00:29:43,834 --> 00:29:47,701
deal with your grief
and with your anger.

623
00:29:47,734 --> 00:29:49,934
No, don't put this on yourself.

624
00:29:51,634 --> 00:29:53,767
You couldn't have done any more

625
00:29:53,801 --> 00:29:55,801
or been a better mother.

626
00:29:57,034 --> 00:29:59,300
She's almost got him.

627
00:29:59,333 --> 00:30:01,534
CHLOE Jack, do you copy?

628
00:30:01,567 --> 00:30:03,300
Yeah, Chloe. Go ahead.

629
00:30:03,333 --> 00:30:05,034
The video feed has
been compromised.

630
00:30:05,068 --> 00:30:06,333
You're being surveilled.

631
00:30:08,001 --> 00:30:10,300
Copy that. I'll take
care of it from here.

632
00:30:10,333 --> 00:30:12,134
Owen, how long will it take to
disconnect the video system?

633
00:30:12,168 --> 00:30:13,300
30 seconds.

634
00:30:13,333 --> 00:30:14,867
Get on it. What's going on, Jack?

635
00:30:14,901 --> 00:30:16,600
Someone else is watching.

636
00:30:16,634 --> 00:30:19,101
Mom...

637
00:30:19,134 --> 00:30:23,333
I know what they want you to do.

638
00:30:23,367 --> 00:30:25,333
But it's too late for that.

639
00:30:25,367 --> 00:30:26,333
Don't say that.

640
00:30:26,367 --> 00:30:28,767
You can still turn yourself in.

641
00:30:28,801 --> 00:30:31,333
We'll hire the best lawyers,
whatever it takes.

642
00:30:31,367 --> 00:30:32,901
I'll be with you every
step of the way.

643
00:30:32,934 --> 00:30:34,101
I promise that.

644
00:30:34,134 --> 00:30:36,701
I'm sorry.

645
00:30:39,367 --> 00:30:42,333
Marcos, I'm-I'm begging you.

646
00:30:42,367 --> 00:30:45,333
Mom, listen to me.

647
00:30:45,367 --> 00:30:47,634
You got to be strong now.

648
00:30:47,667 --> 00:30:49,233
Damn it. No. Marcos.

649
00:30:49,267 --> 00:30:50,767
Marcos,

650
00:30:50,801 --> 00:30:53,200
please. You're all I have.

651
00:30:53,233 --> 00:30:55,300
Please don't do this.

652
00:30:55,333 --> 00:30:58,300
I love you so much.

653
00:30:58,333 --> 00:31:00,034
I'm sorry. It's over.
Get her out of there.

654
00:31:00,068 --> 00:31:02,134
I'm sorry. Now! Move!

655
00:31:02,168 --> 00:31:04,300
Marcos, No! No!

656
00:31:04,333 --> 00:31:07,200
No! Marcos, no!

657
00:31:07,233 --> 00:31:09,300
No! No!

658
00:31:25,367 --> 00:31:27,233
Samir, I just lost picture.

659
00:31:27,267 --> 00:31:28,634
Is his mother still in the room?

660
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,300
No, but he's still in there
with one of the agents.

661
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,934
You detonate that vest,

662
00:31:46,967 --> 00:31:48,934
your mother dies, too.

663
00:31:52,667 --> 00:31:54,767
What did you say?

664
00:31:54,801 --> 00:31:56,867
You heard me.

665
00:31:56,901 --> 00:31:58,801
I'm going to make sure
your mother's in Manhattan

666
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:00,600
when that dirty bomb goes off.

667
00:32:00,634 --> 00:32:02,667
You don't even know
what the target is.

668
00:32:02,701 --> 00:32:05,300
I'm not talking about her
dying during the explosion.

669
00:32:05,333 --> 00:32:07,567
I'm going to personally
escort her to the blast site,

670
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,767
so she's exposed to the radiation.

671
00:32:09,801 --> 00:32:11,834
I don't believe you.

672
00:32:11,867 --> 00:32:14,667
you wouldn't do that.
You're a federal agent.

673
00:32:14,701 --> 00:32:16,534
Truth is, I'm not, really.

674
00:32:16,567 --> 00:32:18,001
Well, not anymore.

675
00:32:18,034 --> 00:32:21,267
I'm more of a specialist that
they brought in for today.

676
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:23,567
If you knew who I was,

677
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,300
and things I've done
before in my life,

678
00:32:26,333 --> 00:32:28,333
you would know that
I'm not bluffing.

679
00:32:28,367 --> 00:32:30,134
So, go ahead.

680
00:32:30,168 --> 00:32:32,367
Blow yourself up into
a million pieces.

681
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,667
First thing I'm going
to do is I'm going

682
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:35,333
to make your mother come
in here and clean it up.

683
00:32:35,367 --> 00:32:39,333
And then I'm going to take
her to the blast site.

684
00:32:39,367 --> 00:32:41,300
Do you know how long
it takes a human body

685
00:32:41,333 --> 00:32:44,001
to absorb a lethal
dose of cesium 137?

686
00:32:44,034 --> 00:32:45,333
Five seconds.

687
00:32:45,367 --> 00:32:47,333
Followed by 12 days of pain

688
00:32:47,367 --> 00:32:50,867
that's so agonizing,
morphine can't even touch it.

689
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:56,934
You got a decision to make.

690
00:32:56,967 --> 00:33:00,300
Make it carefully.

691
00:33:02,967 --> 00:33:05,600
You're not gonna hurt my mother.

692
00:33:05,634 --> 00:33:08,500
I am done playing with you.

693
00:33:08,534 --> 00:33:10,168
You look into my eyes.

694
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:21,434
Look in my eyes!

695
00:33:21,467 --> 00:33:23,801
You think I'm joking.

696
00:33:25,101 --> 00:33:28,267
What happens to your
mother is because of you.

697
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,667
Only you.

698
00:33:40,267 --> 00:33:43,667
If I open the door and I come out,

699
00:33:43,701 --> 00:33:48,367
you promise you won't hurt her?

700
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:51,534
You promise you'll leave her alone?

701
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:55,267
I give you my word.

702
00:34:11,634 --> 00:34:14,500
Cole, I've got some
action on the door.

703
00:34:27,168 --> 00:34:28,701
Put your hands up now!

704
00:34:28,734 --> 00:34:31,567
Walk towards me! Move!

705
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,634
Down on your knees!

706
00:34:32,667 --> 00:34:34,667
Put your hands behind your head

707
00:34:34,701 --> 00:34:37,267
and interlock your fingers!

708
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:39,434
Don't you move!

709
00:34:39,467 --> 00:34:40,701
Cole, I got four lights on.

710
00:34:40,734 --> 00:34:42,200
Damn it!

711
00:34:42,233 --> 00:34:43,500
Cole, I got four lights on!

712
00:34:43,534 --> 00:34:44,600
We need bomb techs now.

713
00:34:44,634 --> 00:34:45,834
The suspect's come
out of the chamber,

714
00:34:45,867 --> 00:34:47,168
but he's managed to arm the vest.

715
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,367
I repeat: he has armed the vest.

716
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,867
We need bomb techs
here to disable it now!

717
00:34:53,534 --> 00:34:54,967
Samir, Marcos is
out of the chamber.

718
00:34:55,001 --> 00:34:56,801
What?! They must have
talked him out it,

719
00:34:56,834 --> 00:34:58,567
but he's rearmed the vest.

720
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,367
You're sure? He's still wearing it?

721
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,500
Yes, I think so.

722
00:35:01,534 --> 00:35:03,434
Hang up right now and
transmit the fail-safe.

723
00:35:03,467 --> 00:35:04,534
Let's move!

724
00:35:04,567 --> 00:35:06,068
Keep you men back!

725
00:35:06,101 --> 00:35:07,867
I know the circuit pattern!

726
00:35:07,901 --> 00:35:09,333
I'm looking for four common leads

727
00:35:09,367 --> 00:35:11,500
before I can disarm it.

728
00:35:18,467 --> 00:35:20,434
What's happening?! What is that?!

729
00:35:22,467 --> 00:35:23,867
Cole, they must have
triggerd a fail-safe.

730
00:35:23,901 --> 00:35:25,001
Get you men back now.

731
00:35:25,034 --> 00:35:26,001
Move! Move! Move!

732
00:35:26,034 --> 00:35:27,534
Get this off of me!

733
00:35:27,567 --> 00:35:29,367
I'm gonna try! Just stay calm!

734
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,168
Mom!

735
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,034
Get her out of here now!

736
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:38,367
Marcos, I might not be
able to do this in time.

737
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,934
I need to know what the target is.

738
00:35:39,967 --> 00:35:41,667
I don't know. How are they

739
00:35:41,701 --> 00:35:42,901
gonna smuggle the fuel
rods into the city

740
00:35:42,934 --> 00:35:44,168
past the radiological detectors?

741
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,333
I don't know, I swear!

742
00:35:45,367 --> 00:35:47,701
Who does?!

743
00:35:47,734 --> 00:35:49,367
Give me a name.

744
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,801
Damn it, Marcos, give me a name!

745
00:35:51,834 --> 00:35:54,801
President Hassan's head
of security Tarin Faroush!

746
00:35:54,834 --> 00:35:56,934
Tarin Faroush.
Did you get that, Cole?

747
00:35:56,967 --> 00:35:58,434
Copy! Come on.

748
00:35:58,467 --> 00:36:01,267
Come on. Come on.

749
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:04,101
One more.

750
00:36:04,134 --> 00:36:08,034
I'm not gonna be able
to do this in time.

751
00:36:08,068 --> 00:36:10,600
You tell my mother I'm sorry.

752
00:36:19,068 --> 00:36:20,600
Jack? Jack, do you copy?

753
00:36:28,801 --> 00:36:30,667
CTU, this is Jack.

754
00:36:30,701 --> 00:36:32,801
Marcos is dead.

755
00:36:32,834 --> 00:36:35,534
I'm gonna need to speak
to President Hassan.

756
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,367
Commissioner, I appreciate
that your NYPD's overburdened,

757
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,901
but I would ask you
to do whatever you can

758
00:36:49,934 --> 00:36:52,600
to have my daughter's
picture circulated.

759
00:36:52,634 --> 00:36:54,201
Please keep me posted

760
00:36:54,234 --> 00:36:57,333
if you get any information
regarding her whereabouts.

761
00:36:57,367 --> 00:36:59,168
Yes.

762
00:36:59,201 --> 00:37:01,168
Thank you.

763
00:37:05,067 --> 00:37:08,101
Sir, CTU is routing a call to you.

764
00:37:08,134 --> 00:37:09,001
From whom?

765
00:37:09,034 --> 00:37:10,300
Jack Bauer.

766
00:37:16,201 --> 00:37:19,067
Yes, Mr. Bauer?
This is President Hassan.

767
00:37:19,101 --> 00:37:21,234
Mr. President,
I was told you were briefed

768
00:37:21,268 --> 00:37:23,067
on the situation at St.
Julian's Hospital.

769
00:37:23,101 --> 00:37:24,101
I was.

770
00:37:24,134 --> 00:37:26,534
Sir, the suicide bomber is dead.

771
00:37:26,567 --> 00:37:28,234
His explosive vest was
remotely detonated.

772
00:37:28,268 --> 00:37:29,734
Then you have no leads.

773
00:37:29,767 --> 00:37:31,134
No, sir, we actually do.

774
00:37:31,168 --> 00:37:32,567
Before the suspect was killed,

775
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:33,934
he identified your
head of security,

776
00:37:33,967 --> 00:37:35,867
Tarin Faroush, as a co-conspirator.

777
00:37:37,967 --> 00:37:40,168
Tarin?

778
00:37:40,201 --> 00:37:41,500
Are you sure about this?

779
00:37:41,534 --> 00:37:43,134
Yes, sir. Right now you
need to call UN security

780
00:37:43,168 --> 00:37:46,134
and have them take Mr.
Faroush into custody until we get there.

781
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,700
That won't be possible, Mr. Bauer.

782
00:37:50,734 --> 00:37:52,834
Tarin's not here.

783
00:37:52,867 --> 00:37:54,034
Where is he?

784
00:37:54,067 --> 00:37:55,634
I don't know.
Somewhere with my daughter.

785
00:37:55,667 --> 00:37:57,168
Excuse me?

786
00:37:57,201 --> 00:37:59,268
They are in love...

787
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:01,234
so I've learned.

788
00:38:01,268 --> 00:38:04,234
Mr. Bauer, I suspected
Tarin hours ago,

789
00:38:04,268 --> 00:38:06,168
and had him arrested
for questioning.

790
00:38:06,201 --> 00:38:10,333
He escaped while being
transported to our embassy.

791
00:38:10,367 --> 00:38:11,734
Kayla believed he was innocent,

792
00:38:11,767 --> 00:38:15,700
and has, apparently,
run away with him.

793
00:38:15,734 --> 00:38:17,400
Do you have any idea
where they might be?

794
00:38:17,433 --> 00:38:19,534
None. Can you contact
your daughter?

795
00:38:19,567 --> 00:38:21,333
My wife has made several attempts,

796
00:38:21,367 --> 00:38:22,634
but she isn't answering her phone.

797
00:38:22,667 --> 00:38:23,834
Sir, you need to keep trying.

798
00:38:23,867 --> 00:38:25,534
Right now Mr.
Faroush is our only lead.

799
00:38:25,567 --> 00:38:27,867
I'm going to jump in the shower.

800
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:47,234
Hello, Mother.

801
00:38:47,268 --> 00:38:48,300
Kayla?

802
00:38:48,333 --> 00:38:49,700
I have her.

803
00:38:49,734 --> 00:38:51,700
Mr. Bauer, Darling,
are you all right?

804
00:38:51,734 --> 00:38:54,433
we have Kayla on
line with her mother.

805
00:38:54,467 --> 00:38:57,168
Oh, I'm fine, Mother. Mr.
President, you need to get me an address.

806
00:38:57,201 --> 00:38:58,834
I'm sorry I've been
ignoring your calls,

807
00:38:58,867 --> 00:39:01,034
but I know Father has
put you up to this.

808
00:39:01,067 --> 00:39:03,234
Where are you? You know
I can't tell you that.

809
00:39:03,268 --> 00:39:04,234
Is Tarin with you?

810
00:39:04,268 --> 00:39:05,934
Not at the moment, no.

811
00:39:05,967 --> 00:39:08,367
He doesn't want me
to speak to anyone.

812
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:13,300
Kayla, listen to me,
you are in danger.

813
00:39:13,333 --> 00:39:16,034
Tarin is working with
your father's enemies.

814
00:39:16,067 --> 00:39:17,567
That's not true.

815
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,901
It's Father's paranoid delusions.

816
00:39:18,934 --> 00:39:19,901
It isn't.

817
00:39:19,934 --> 00:39:21,134
CTU just called to confirm.

818
00:39:21,168 --> 00:39:22,967
They're on the line
with your father now.

819
00:39:23,001 --> 00:39:24,867
I don't believe you.

820
00:39:24,901 --> 00:39:28,400
Kayla, please.

821
00:39:28,433 --> 00:39:32,268
You know I loathed
your father's behavior

822
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:35,901
and the way that he's
handled everything.

823
00:39:35,934 --> 00:39:38,201
I wouldn't be telling you this

824
00:39:38,234 --> 00:39:39,934
unless I believed it, too.

825
00:39:39,967 --> 00:39:42,034
Not Tarin.

826
00:39:42,067 --> 00:39:43,967
It has to be a mistake.

827
00:39:44,001 --> 00:39:46,734
Then we'll sort it out together.

828
00:39:46,767 --> 00:39:50,901
But you must tell me where you are.

829
00:39:52,567 --> 00:39:54,101
Kayla!

830
00:39:54,134 --> 00:39:57,934
The Teodore Hotel, suite 514.

831
00:39:57,967 --> 00:40:00,134
The Teodore, suite 514.

832
00:40:00,168 --> 00:40:03,901
Mr. Bauer. Kayla, darling,
just stay where you are.

833
00:40:03,934 --> 00:40:05,367
The police will be there shortly.

834
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,268
They are at the Teodore Hotel,
suite 514.

835
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,834
Thank you, sir.

836
00:40:10,201 --> 00:40:13,600
I promise I'll call you once
the Americans give us asylum.

837
00:40:13,634 --> 00:40:15,734
Please don't tell Father we spoke.

838
00:40:15,767 --> 00:40:17,634
Kayla? I love you, too. Hello?

839
00:40:17,667 --> 00:40:19,801
I thought we agreed

840
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:21,467
you weren't gonna take
your mother's call.

841
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:24,300
I'm sorry, my love.
I just didn't want her to worry.

842
00:40:25,634 --> 00:40:28,967
Did you tell her where we are?

843
00:40:29,001 --> 00:40:30,201
Did you?

844
00:40:30,234 --> 00:40:31,734
Of course not.

845
00:40:31,767 --> 00:40:33,667
Do you think I'm stupid?

846
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:36,101
You know I could never
think such a thing.

847
00:40:36,134 --> 00:40:37,767
You are perfection.

848
00:40:40,101 --> 00:40:42,067
Now come on. We must get dressed.

849
00:40:42,101 --> 00:40:43,168
Where are we going?

850
00:40:43,201 --> 00:40:45,433
Where do you think?

851
00:40:45,467 --> 00:40:47,500
To formally request our asylum.

852
00:40:47,534 --> 00:40:49,134
At this hour?

853
00:40:49,168 --> 00:40:50,201
My friend at

854
00:40:50,234 --> 00:40:51,201
the State Department
made the arrangements.

855
00:40:51,234 --> 00:40:52,400
But I'm exhausted.

856
00:40:52,433 --> 00:40:55,333
We haven't even slept.

857
00:40:55,367 --> 00:40:57,967
I suppose you blame
me for that, huh?

858
00:40:58,001 --> 00:40:59,834
Well, then... can't we have

859
00:40:59,867 --> 00:41:02,700
a little more time together?

860
00:41:04,034 --> 00:41:06,834
No. Come on.

861
00:41:06,867 --> 00:41:08,500
You must get dressed.

862
00:41:11,834 --> 00:41:14,667
Why don't you just
get dressed here?

863
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:17,034
I'm just gonna clean up first.

864
00:41:33,067 --> 00:41:35,600
He's in the Teodore Hotel,
suite 514.

865
00:41:35,634 --> 00:41:38,500
And Kayla's... Kayla's with him.

866
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:48,234
Our men are clearing out now.
It's all yours.

867
00:41:48,268 --> 00:41:49,567
Where are we?

868
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,101
I could have a Tac team at
the Teodore in 20 minutes.

869
00:41:51,134 --> 00:41:52,600
No, NYPD can get there faster.

870
00:41:52,634 --> 00:41:53,934
I want your men to
set up a perimeter

871
00:41:53,967 --> 00:41:55,101
and wait until we get there.

872
00:41:55,134 --> 00:41:56,268
If any of your men

873
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:57,700
happen to come in contact
with the suspect,

874
00:41:57,734 --> 00:41:58,867
it is imperative that they know

875
00:41:58,901 --> 00:42:00,400
we need to take him alive.
Let's go.
