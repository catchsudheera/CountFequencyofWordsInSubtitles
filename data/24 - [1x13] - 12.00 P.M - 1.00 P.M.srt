1
00:00:14,569 --> 00:00:20,073
Right now, terrorists are plotting
to assassinate a presidential candidate.

2
00:00:20,158 --> 00:00:23,443
My wife and daughter have been kidnapped.

3
00:00:23,536 --> 00:00:26,739
And people that I work with
may be involved in both.

4
00:00:27,457 --> 00:00:33,376
I'm Federal Agent Jack Bauer.
This is the longest day of my life.

5
00:02:56,415 --> 00:02:58,645
Keep moving.

6
00:03:03,135 --> 00:03:05,491
Neill, cut them off at the service road.

7
00:03:05,575 --> 00:03:08,932
- The rest of you, come up behind him.
- Ira...

8
00:03:09,015 --> 00:03:11,211
How could you let this happen?

9
00:03:12,496 --> 00:03:16,774
We're cutting them off at the service road.
Bauer, his wife and daughter. And Rick.

10
00:03:16,856 --> 00:03:19,609
Make sure they don't double back.

11
00:03:19,695 --> 00:03:23,166
- I thought I could handle him. I thought...
- Stop thinking.

12
00:03:39,496 --> 00:03:42,966
OK, we... we have to keep moving.

13
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:45,651
- What if Dad isn't...
- No, your dad's OK.

14
00:03:45,737 --> 00:03:48,205
He told us to meet him
by the water tower and we will.

15
00:03:48,297 --> 00:03:52,529
We just have to follow the creek.
Let's go. Come on! Let's go! Come on!

16
00:04:00,697 --> 00:04:04,087
- I can't...
- Shut up. You can and you will.

17
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:07,965
- I'm slowing you down.
- Yes, you are, so you'd better speed up.

18
00:04:09,017 --> 00:04:11,133
Sh. Get down. Get down!

19
00:04:23,617 --> 00:04:25,608
Where are you?

20
00:04:27,018 --> 00:04:29,009
Yeah. I got nothing.

21
00:05:06,619 --> 00:05:08,610
Sh. We can move.

22
00:05:14,419 --> 00:05:16,410
Wait. Come here. Get down.

23
00:05:30,139 --> 00:05:32,415
What are we gonna do, Mom?

24
00:05:33,179 --> 00:05:36,616
We can't go back, we can't go forward.
They're everywhere.

25
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:43,539
I think... we can catch the road further up
where it cuts through the woods.

26
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:47,613
- Dad told us to follow the creek bed.
- We don't really have a choice, do we?

27
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,850
We'll go up here. Come on.

28
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:04,495
The subscriber you are trying to reach...

29
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:14,293
Hey. The property where
they're holding Jack's family

30
00:06:14,381 --> 00:06:17,498
was leased six months ago
by a company that doesn't exist.

31
00:06:17,581 --> 00:06:19,572
I have to go over the tax records.

32
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:25,169
- You all right?
- Jack's still not answering his cell.

33
00:06:25,621 --> 00:06:28,294
Well, he could've shut it off
to keep it from ringing.

34
00:06:28,381 --> 00:06:31,054
- Or maybe something's happened to him.
- Oh, look.

35
00:06:31,142 --> 00:06:33,701
If anybody can
take care of himself, it's Jack.

36
00:06:33,781 --> 00:06:38,218
Plus our tactical units should be there soon.
Bundy's heading up the operation. He's good.

37
00:06:38,302 --> 00:06:42,056
Maybe you were right.
I should have brought Green in sooner.

38
00:06:42,142 --> 00:06:45,259
You let Jack make the call
because it was his family on the line.

39
00:06:45,341 --> 00:06:47,776
- What could you do?
- Yeah.

40
00:06:53,422 --> 00:06:59,372
Look, I'm sorry. Since this whole thing
got started, I guess I've been a little harsh.

41
00:07:00,822 --> 00:07:03,416
A little?

42
00:07:03,502 --> 00:07:05,572
OK, maybe a lot.

43
00:07:05,662 --> 00:07:09,621
I just... I've been afraid, and I...

44
00:07:09,703 --> 00:07:11,897
You don't have to explain. All right?

45
00:07:11,982 --> 00:07:15,180
You wanna talk about us,
we'll talk about it later, OK?

46
00:07:15,262 --> 00:07:19,813
- I just want you to know that it's nothing...
- You're bringing in Jamey Farrell's mother?

47
00:07:19,902 --> 00:07:21,733
Yes, to pick up Kyle, her son.

48
00:07:21,822 --> 00:07:24,781
Before she sees him,
I want the two of you to question her.

49
00:07:24,863 --> 00:07:28,094
If she has information that can help
protect Palmer, I need to know.

50
00:07:28,183 --> 00:07:32,620
- What makes you think she has?
- $300,000 was deposited in her bank account

51
00:07:32,703 --> 00:07:34,694
over the last four months.

52
00:07:38,663 --> 00:07:42,451
They killed George Ferragamo.
That fire was no accident.

53
00:07:42,543 --> 00:07:45,695
I wanna talk to Maureen Kingsley,
then go right to the DA.

54
00:07:45,784 --> 00:07:48,696
Wait until you have the facts
before you go off.

55
00:07:48,784 --> 00:07:51,695
The facts? Ferragamo was killed
so I could get elected.

56
00:07:51,784 --> 00:07:53,775
- You don't know that.
- Then what?

57
00:07:53,864 --> 00:07:59,779
I'm just saying, let's take a beat, see how
we should play this, before we do anything.

58
00:07:59,864 --> 00:08:02,059
There's only one way to play this, Mike.

59
00:08:02,144 --> 00:08:05,295
Maureen Kingsley will get
the story of her career after all.

60
00:08:05,384 --> 00:08:08,023
- David...
- And after I talk to her I wanna see the DA.

61
00:08:08,104 --> 00:08:11,653
- Shouldn't you run this by Sherry?
- Why? So she can try to talk me out of it?

62
00:08:11,744 --> 00:08:16,579
She's your wife, David.
This is her life too. She deserves to know.

63
00:08:22,584 --> 00:08:26,180
- Has the compound been cleared?
- Yes. There's been a change of plan.

64
00:08:26,264 --> 00:08:29,735
- Meaning?
- Bauer showed up here like I said he would.

65
00:08:29,824 --> 00:08:33,214
- You have him?
- Not yet, but I will.

66
00:08:34,585 --> 00:08:39,454
Congratulations, Ira. You may have
bought yourself a second chance.

67
00:08:39,545 --> 00:08:43,618
My contract included killing Palmer.
I wanna make good on it.

68
00:08:43,705 --> 00:08:47,983
The way you were talking, it sounded like
you handed it off to someone else.

69
00:08:48,066 --> 00:08:52,456
Bring me Bauer's body.
Then we'll talk about the senator.

70
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:55,699
You'll hear from me soon.

71
00:08:58,306 --> 00:09:00,580
Drazen?

72
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:04,897
Yeah. Either we eliminate Bauer
or Drazen eliminates us.

73
00:09:05,746 --> 00:09:09,056
- And that's the only option here?
- Basically.

74
00:09:09,146 --> 00:09:11,660
Getting Bauer's not as easy as it sounds.

75
00:09:12,546 --> 00:09:14,901
He phoned in some
GPS coordinates to somebody.

76
00:09:14,986 --> 00:09:18,615
Whoever that is, I'm sure they're
gonna be calling the cavalry in soon.

77
00:09:18,706 --> 00:09:22,016
I say we just cut our losses
and get the hell outta here.

78
00:09:22,106 --> 00:09:25,179
You don't just get out with these people.
They come after you.

79
00:09:25,266 --> 00:09:28,225
They keep coming until they find you,
no matter where you are.

80
00:09:28,306 --> 00:09:30,740
And when they do...

81
00:09:30,827 --> 00:09:34,705
Believe me, killing Bauer
is our only chance of staying alive.

82
00:10:10,628 --> 00:10:14,337
They should have been here by now.
Come here. Sit down.

83
00:10:14,428 --> 00:10:16,817
Easy, easy.

84
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:18,899
Here, let me take a look at it.

85
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:26,384
OK. This is gonna sting for a while,
but you're not mortally wounded.

86
00:10:26,468 --> 00:10:30,222
The bullet passed straight through.
It didn't hit any bone or major artery.

87
00:10:30,308 --> 00:10:33,186
- You got any loose clothing?
- Yeah, in my back pocket.

88
00:10:33,269 --> 00:10:35,260
I got it.

89
00:10:36,829 --> 00:10:38,978
Take a deep breath.

90
00:10:43,789 --> 00:10:46,541
- Wait. Hold up, honey, hold up.
- Are you OK?

91
00:10:46,628 --> 00:10:50,985
Yeah, no, I just...
I just wanna check where we are. We...

92
00:10:52,469 --> 00:10:57,304
We... we may have veered a little south,
but we should have hit the road by now.

93
00:11:02,869 --> 00:11:05,463
I can't see it. Do you see it up ahead?

94
00:11:06,829 --> 00:11:09,104
You don't know where we are, do you?

95
00:11:11,429 --> 00:11:13,420
Mom.

96
00:11:15,149 --> 00:11:18,141
We're lost, aren't we?

97
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:20,380
No.

98
00:11:20,469 --> 00:11:22,903
We should just go straight.

99
00:11:22,989 --> 00:11:25,584
- It should be just up ahead.
- Are you sure?

100
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:44,149
That'll help stop the bleeding.

101
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:49,381
That's good.

102
00:11:59,071 --> 00:12:01,630
Mike's your advisor. What's his advice?

103
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:08,267
He agrees with me.

104
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:12,741
He thinks you're making a mistake
by trying to take them on.

105
00:12:12,831 --> 00:12:17,427
- They've already covered up one death.
- No, you don't know about Ferragamo.

106
00:12:21,951 --> 00:12:23,942
But even if you're right,

107
00:12:25,992 --> 00:12:29,586
will turning this into a media circus
bring him back to life?

108
00:12:29,672 --> 00:12:34,746
- That's not the point.
- Your career. And your family.

109
00:12:35,192 --> 00:12:39,549
You're... you're throwing away
everything you've built

110
00:12:40,591 --> 00:12:43,902
without any hard evidence
of what really happened.

111
00:12:43,992 --> 00:12:45,983
The police will find the evidence.

112
00:12:46,072 --> 00:12:51,704
No. They won't, because
Carl and the people he works for,

113
00:12:51,792 --> 00:12:55,831
they will twist the system
to get the result that they want.

114
00:12:56,952 --> 00:12:58,943
That's what they do, David.

115
00:13:01,632 --> 00:13:04,021
And you'll be left with nothing.

116
00:13:10,273 --> 00:13:13,310
Sweetheart, to fight these people
you need power.

117
00:13:15,832 --> 00:13:21,031
The kind of power you'll have
once you become president.

118
00:13:26,713 --> 00:13:31,343
We knew from the start
that this was going to be an uphill race.

119
00:13:33,713 --> 00:13:35,704
But we're almost there.

120
00:13:36,914 --> 00:13:38,905
Look at the polls.

121
00:13:44,113 --> 00:13:47,265
- Sherry, I don't know.
- No. Think, David, think.

122
00:13:53,114 --> 00:13:59,587
Think of the millions of lives you can
make better once you win the candidacy.

123
00:14:00,674 --> 00:14:02,665
How can I do the job

124
00:14:03,994 --> 00:14:05,985
when my own house isn't in order?

125
00:14:09,274 --> 00:14:11,266
David.

126
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:24,433
I told them to wait for us here at the water
tower. You heard me say that, right? Dammit.

127
00:14:24,515 --> 00:14:27,712
- What are you gonna do?
- I gotta go back and find 'em.

128
00:14:31,435 --> 00:14:33,187
- Green.
- It's Jack.

129
00:14:33,275 --> 00:14:36,153
- There's been a complication.
- I'm listening.

130
00:14:36,235 --> 00:14:39,386
Teri and Kim are not where they should be.
I've gotta find them.

131
00:14:39,476 --> 00:14:41,865
I need to let the team
know where to pick you up.

132
00:14:41,956 --> 00:14:45,028
Tell them to meet us at a water tower,
north area of the compound.

133
00:14:45,115 --> 00:14:48,391
Check your satellite photos.
It's overlooking a reservoir.

134
00:14:48,475 --> 00:14:52,594
Alberta, if I'm not back when the team
arrives, they're gonna find a kid in here.

135
00:14:52,675 --> 00:14:55,508
- His name is Rick. He's wounded.
- Who is he?

136
00:14:55,596 --> 00:14:57,507
Someone who helped us get out of there.

137
00:14:57,595 --> 00:15:00,554
- Three tactical units are on their way.
- How much longer?

138
00:15:00,635 --> 00:15:03,275
- 10 minutes. 15, tops.
- OK, I copy. Out.

139
00:15:05,316 --> 00:15:07,432
- Jack.
- What?

140
00:15:07,516 --> 00:15:09,586
Thanks.

141
00:15:09,676 --> 00:15:12,270
Don't thank me. Thank my daughter.

142
00:15:13,276 --> 00:15:15,665
This whole thing,
I had no idea what was going on.

143
00:15:15,756 --> 00:15:19,032
Dan said we were just scaring
some guys who'd backed out of a deal.

144
00:15:19,117 --> 00:15:23,588
Yeah, well, when you started to see what was
happening, you should have done something.

145
00:15:23,676 --> 00:15:25,985
He was my friend.

146
00:15:26,077 --> 00:15:30,866
Hey, you kidnapped my daughter.
You're gonna have to live with that.

147
00:15:34,636 --> 00:15:37,674
Son, part of getting a second chance
is taking responsibility

148
00:15:37,757 --> 00:15:41,511
for the mess you made in the first place,
you understand me?

149
00:15:42,197 --> 00:15:44,586
Good. I'll be back in a few minutes.

150
00:16:18,838 --> 00:16:23,116
That shack over there. Maybe we can
find it on this to see where we are.

151
00:16:26,758 --> 00:16:29,511
See? I don't think we're as far off as I thought.

152
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:32,746
Mom!

153
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:40,510
Honey, come on. Stay down.

154
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,991
Go, go.

155
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,471
Down. Down.

156
00:18:09,681 --> 00:18:13,391
It's Gaines.
Everyone circle back to section five.

157
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:32,753
OK. When he gets
to the back of the shed, we'll go.

158
00:18:32,841 --> 00:18:35,037
- What if he sees us?
- We'll be all right.

159
00:18:35,442 --> 00:18:37,433
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, it's nothing.

160
00:18:37,522 --> 00:18:41,754
- Mom, you keep saying that, but...
- It's gonna be fine, I promise, honey. It's fine.

161
00:18:41,842 --> 00:18:44,197
- Mom!
- Teri, stay down!

162
00:18:59,882 --> 00:19:01,953
- Jack!
- Are you both OK?

163
00:19:02,042 --> 00:19:03,556
- Yeah.
- Come here.

164
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:06,440
This is Gaines. Who's shooting?

165
00:19:08,163 --> 00:19:10,757
Whoever's shooting,
call in your position now!

166
00:19:10,843 --> 00:19:14,153
Dammit! They're gonna swarm this place.
We gotta get outta here.

167
00:19:14,242 --> 00:19:16,154
- Where's Rick? Is he OK?
- He's fine.

168
00:19:16,243 --> 00:19:18,393
- Where is he?
- Waiting at the water tower.

169
00:19:18,483 --> 00:19:22,032
CTU's sending a chopper.
We gotta get outta here now. Hold on.

170
00:19:26,243 --> 00:19:30,953
OK, come on, it's clear. Come on,
we gotta move. We don't have much time.

171
00:20:00,644 --> 00:20:03,113
Hello, Mrs. Vasquez. Thank you for coming in.

172
00:20:03,204 --> 00:20:06,515
- They said I could pick up my grandson.
- We'll take you to him soon.

173
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:09,994
- First we wanna ask you a few questions.
- Yes, I have a question too.

174
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:14,715
How can a woman bleed to death,
and nobody does anything about it?

175
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:20,433
We're sorry about Jamey, Mrs. Vasquez.

176
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:23,514
But it wasn't like that.

177
00:20:25,165 --> 00:20:27,998
My daughter's dead, isn't she?

178
00:20:30,365 --> 00:20:33,596
Please... take me to Kyle.

179
00:20:33,685 --> 00:20:35,994
We really do have to ask you a few questions.

180
00:20:36,085 --> 00:20:39,476
- I'm not interested in your questions.
- Mrs. Vasquez.

181
00:20:42,686 --> 00:20:45,075
Your daughter was a traitor.

182
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:49,158
- What?
- She confessed before she died.

183
00:20:50,886 --> 00:20:55,004
And if you withhold information,
you can be held as an accomplice.

184
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:58,958
If that happens,
who's gonna take care of Kyle?

185
00:21:09,406 --> 00:21:11,761
What do you want to know?

186
00:21:11,846 --> 00:21:15,475
IRS records show you earn $45,000 a year.

187
00:21:15,566 --> 00:21:21,085
But an account in your name shows a series
of deposits adding up to more than $300,000.

188
00:21:24,927 --> 00:21:28,044
It's... It's from Jamey.

189
00:21:30,367 --> 00:21:34,565
So that Kyle would have enough money
in case something happened to her.

190
00:21:34,647 --> 00:21:37,036
Who gave Jamey the money?

191
00:21:39,447 --> 00:21:42,007
- She never said.
- And you never asked?

192
00:21:43,127 --> 00:21:47,166
All this money in your account, and
you never once asked where it came from?

193
00:21:49,687 --> 00:21:51,678
Kyle needs you.

194
00:21:52,608 --> 00:21:54,916
Don't do anything to jeopardise that.

195
00:22:02,728 --> 00:22:07,563
Maxton and Neill, you're the only two who
haven't checked in yet. Where are you?

196
00:22:07,648 --> 00:22:09,877
One more time. Maxton and Neill.

197
00:22:12,448 --> 00:22:15,724
- This is Maxton.
- Where are you? Why haven't you called in?

198
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:20,484
We're crossing the creek bed,
trying to cut off Bauer from the service road.

199
00:22:20,568 --> 00:22:23,766
Not if you keep telling me where you are.
Give me the PalmPilot.

200
00:22:23,848 --> 00:22:29,128
Neill is the only one who hasn't called in.
Maxton, what area was Neill patrolling?

201
00:22:29,208 --> 00:22:32,997
Uh... the northeast side of the creek.
He split off on his own.

202
00:22:33,649 --> 00:22:35,924
OK. They're coming from over there.

203
00:22:36,008 --> 00:22:40,560
We can hit the road down a little farther,
avoid them completely. Come on.

204
00:22:47,009 --> 00:22:51,127
Maureen? Don't make me get hotel security.
I know you're in there.

205
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:05,759
- Why are you shutting me out?
- I think we've said everything we need to say.

206
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:07,841
Can I at least come in?

207
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:13,525
Maureen, please. Open the door and let me in.

208
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:25,407
I know I asked you
to back off the story about my son.

209
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:28,281
But I've changed my mind.

210
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:32,640
Dr Ferragamo's dead.

211
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:38,205
- You already knew.
- I don't wanna hear any more.

212
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:40,361
What do you mean, you don't wanna hear it?

213
00:23:40,451 --> 00:23:42,885
- I've left the network.
- What?

214
00:23:43,891 --> 00:23:46,849
- When?
- You should leave it alone too.

215
00:23:47,411 --> 00:23:50,368
That's my advice. As a friend.

216
00:23:52,851 --> 00:23:54,842
They got to you.

217
00:23:55,611 --> 00:23:57,726
Did they pay you off?

218
00:23:57,811 --> 00:24:01,247
Because I wouldn't have thought
you were for sale.

219
00:24:08,691 --> 00:24:11,330
They threatened you too.

220
00:24:12,051 --> 00:24:14,964
- I'll see that you're protected.
- I have protected myself.

221
00:24:15,051 --> 00:24:18,249
Maureen. You're withholding
evidence in a capital crime.

222
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:22,245
What evidence? Dr Ferragamo is dead.

223
00:24:22,331 --> 00:24:24,322
His files have been destroyed.

224
00:24:24,412 --> 00:24:28,451
- But the piece of paper with Keith's writing...
- There is no piece of paper.

225
00:24:30,212 --> 00:24:32,931
Not any more.

226
00:24:33,011 --> 00:24:36,004
There's still my word.
It counts for something.

227
00:24:37,212 --> 00:24:39,203
It's not enough, Senator.

228
00:24:40,892 --> 00:24:43,167
Not against these people.

229
00:24:47,492 --> 00:24:49,960
I'm sorry.

230
00:25:19,614 --> 00:25:22,890
- There's no radio.
- Bauer's been listening.

231
00:25:22,973 --> 00:25:24,964
To every damn word!

232
00:25:27,613 --> 00:25:30,811
Mrs. Vasquez has received
two wire transfers since January.

233
00:25:30,893 --> 00:25:34,887
Both from a holding company
called Luca Univox based in Belgrade.

234
00:25:34,974 --> 00:25:37,204
Jack suggested a connection to Belgrade.

235
00:25:37,294 --> 00:25:41,890
- He was on assignment there two years ago.
- Did you check for a connection to the hit?

236
00:25:41,974 --> 00:25:44,772
These new files may give us a new angle.

237
00:25:44,854 --> 00:25:49,245
So who do we know in Belgrade
who's keyed into the financial community?

238
00:25:53,854 --> 00:25:55,845
Come on.

239
00:26:06,054 --> 00:26:08,125
Can you call them?

240
00:26:08,214 --> 00:26:11,810
Maybe. The chopper
should have been here by now.

241
00:26:11,895 --> 00:26:15,524
- What about Rick? Isn't he meeting us here?
- Dammit. No signal.

242
00:26:16,535 --> 00:26:21,484
Rick was wounded. He's in the water tower.
When the chopper arrives, he'll come out.

243
00:26:21,575 --> 00:26:23,486
- So what are we waiting for?
- Kim.

244
00:26:23,575 --> 00:26:27,454
- Shouldn't he at least know we're here?
- When your father says it's OK.

245
00:26:27,536 --> 00:26:29,685
- There's no one even around. Dad.
- Kim, no!

246
00:26:30,215 --> 00:26:32,127
Get back! Get back!

247
00:26:39,375 --> 00:26:41,936
- It's a sniper rifle.
- What do we do?

248
00:26:43,176 --> 00:26:47,806
Stay here. Don't move for anything
but the chopper. Do you understand me?

249
00:26:47,896 --> 00:26:49,807
- Where are you going?
- He wants me.

250
00:26:49,896 --> 00:26:51,887
Jack!

251
00:27:25,937 --> 00:27:28,371
He's trying to draw us away from the women.

252
00:27:28,457 --> 00:27:31,529
It's fine by me.
Once he's dead, they'll be easy.

253
00:27:31,617 --> 00:27:35,735
I'll keep him pinned down.
Circle around till you get a clear shot.

254
00:28:14,338 --> 00:28:16,693
- Dammit.
- That's right, Jack.

255
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:19,292
You don't have a shot from that distance.

256
00:28:23,378 --> 00:28:26,212
- How much longer do we have?
- Until what?

257
00:28:29,699 --> 00:28:31,768
Until your people get here.

258
00:28:31,859 --> 00:28:34,418
I wouldn't wait around
to find out if I were you.

259
00:28:34,499 --> 00:28:38,617
I don't have a choice.
The people I work for made that pretty clear.

260
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:30,932
Agh!

261
00:29:51,501 --> 00:29:54,140
The DA's inside. You want me to sit in?

262
00:29:58,622 --> 00:30:01,181
Give me a minute.

263
00:30:01,261 --> 00:30:03,456
- Sir?
- It's OK.

264
00:30:03,542 --> 00:30:05,533
He's with the campaign.

265
00:30:10,061 --> 00:30:13,736
The DA's down the hall, Carl.
Waiting for me to tell a story.

266
00:30:15,502 --> 00:30:19,973
- It's over.
- See, and I think it's just getting started.

267
00:30:22,942 --> 00:30:25,297
Don't get stupid on me now, David.

268
00:30:25,382 --> 00:30:30,092
- It seems I've been stupid for a long time.
- Then open your eyes for once.

269
00:30:30,182 --> 00:30:34,095
This... the whole thing, it's one big machine.

270
00:30:34,182 --> 00:30:38,495
I'm the oil that keeps the pistons pumping,
the motor turning, the wheels spinning...

271
00:30:38,582 --> 00:30:40,699
Not any more.

272
00:30:40,782 --> 00:30:43,216
I like you, David. I really do.

273
00:30:43,303 --> 00:30:47,216
And I think you would make
one hell of a commander in chief.

274
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:50,295
I know what you did to Ferragamo.

275
00:30:50,382 --> 00:30:54,456
Every engine produces waste.
It's the physics of the situation.

276
00:30:55,862 --> 00:30:58,855
- Listen to yourself.
- Consider the alternatives.

277
00:30:58,943 --> 00:31:03,653
A year from now, you'll either be promoting
your agenda for the nation,

278
00:31:03,743 --> 00:31:05,893
or visiting your son in prison.

279
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:11,774
- A jury will believe that it was an accident.
- I'm not talking about the rapist, David.

280
00:31:11,864 --> 00:31:14,661
I'm talking about Dr Ferragamo.

281
00:31:16,104 --> 00:31:19,254
- Keith had nothing to do with Ferragamo.
- Of course he didn't.

282
00:31:19,343 --> 00:31:23,895
But if somebody were
to mention the word "arson"...

283
00:31:29,224 --> 00:31:31,215
You son of a bitch!

284
00:31:32,944 --> 00:31:35,014
You planted something?

285
00:31:35,104 --> 00:31:39,620
The people we both work for, David,
they know how to get what they want.

286
00:31:49,784 --> 00:31:52,059
Hi, Mike.

287
00:31:58,664 --> 00:32:00,735
What was that all about?

288
00:32:06,145 --> 00:32:09,854
The DA's waiting in there.
What do you want me to say?

289
00:32:12,945 --> 00:32:14,936
Tell him I'm sorry.

290
00:32:15,745 --> 00:32:17,861
I have nothing to say.

291
00:32:17,945 --> 00:32:20,015
I made a mistake.

292
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:22,574
I don't understand.

293
00:32:22,665 --> 00:32:24,735
I'm running for president, Mike.

294
00:32:26,626 --> 00:32:29,185
And I'm gonna win.

295
00:33:00,706 --> 00:33:02,618
- Hey!
- Over here!

296
00:33:02,707 --> 00:33:04,698
Hey!

297
00:33:13,146 --> 00:33:15,137
Wait.

298
00:33:25,147 --> 00:33:29,425
Federal agent! Drop your weapons!
Put your hands in the air!

299
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:30,906
- Mrs. Bauer?
- Yes!

300
00:33:30,987 --> 00:33:34,582
Put your hands down. Do you
or your daughter need medical attention?

301
00:33:34,668 --> 00:33:36,545
- No, but my husband...
- Where is he?

302
00:33:36,627 --> 00:33:38,983
- I don't know. He's somewhere up there.
- Go!

303
00:33:39,507 --> 00:33:40,940
Come on.

304
00:33:46,907 --> 00:33:49,296
Stay back.

305
00:33:49,387 --> 00:33:50,264
Kim!

306
00:33:50,347 --> 00:33:52,782
- Mrs. Bauer, wait!
- It's all right. Kim!

307
00:33:54,707 --> 00:33:57,302
Kim! Kimberly, stop. Kim!

308
00:33:58,588 --> 00:33:59,657
Kim.

309
00:34:02,748 --> 00:34:07,697
- Dad said he'd be in here. Where is he?
- Wherever he is, they'll find him.

310
00:34:07,788 --> 00:34:10,018
- What if Gaines found him?
- He'd be dead.

311
00:34:10,108 --> 00:34:13,339
They'd be carrying him
outta here in a body bag.

312
00:34:13,428 --> 00:34:17,341
- No. He's gotta be here. I gotta find him.
- Just stop it, Kimberly.

313
00:34:17,948 --> 00:34:21,225
I know you care about this boy,
but I need you to be here for me now,

314
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:24,221
and your dad needs
both of us to be there for him.

315
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:19,141
You're losing blood.

316
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:25,108
Not enough to stop me from killing you.

317
00:35:26,551 --> 00:35:28,940
Maybe neither onus has to die.

318
00:35:31,511 --> 00:35:34,025
Like I said, Jack, I don't have that choice.

319
00:35:37,391 --> 00:35:40,861
Then maybe at least
you can tell me what's going on.

320
00:35:50,951 --> 00:35:54,547
Cofell. He mentioned
something about Belgrade.

321
00:35:54,631 --> 00:35:58,341
That was a military operation.
How's Palmer connected to that?

322
00:35:58,431 --> 00:36:02,060
- You were there, Jack. You should know.
- Let's say I don't.

323
00:36:17,552 --> 00:36:20,988
Neither do I. The less I know,
the better I can do my job.

324
00:36:21,072 --> 00:36:23,666
That’s just the nature four business.

325
00:36:29,872 --> 00:36:32,671
Then why did you bring my family into this?

326
00:36:34,312 --> 00:36:36,304
That might have been a mistake.

327
00:36:37,432 --> 00:36:39,423
They wanted to make it personal.

328
00:36:44,272 --> 00:36:46,263
Who's "they"?

329
00:36:47,793 --> 00:36:51,103
Put down the weapon, Mr. Gaines.
We can protect you.

330
00:36:54,153 --> 00:36:56,144
No, you can't.

331
00:36:58,753 --> 00:37:00,744
Put down the weapon!

332
00:37:09,153 --> 00:37:10,223
Good luck.

333
00:37:23,714 --> 00:37:25,864
Federal agent! Drop your weapon!

334
00:37:25,953 --> 00:37:28,548
Interlace your fingers behind your head.

335
00:37:30,114 --> 00:37:34,392
Sir, we have Bauer in custody.
We also have another man down.

336
00:37:35,074 --> 00:37:39,386
- Bring Bauer to the landing zone right away.
- Roger. Bringing him in.

337
00:38:26,995 --> 00:38:28,873
- Sweetheart?
- Jack!

338
00:38:28,956 --> 00:38:31,185
- Oh!
- Oh, thank God you're OK!

339
00:38:35,916 --> 00:38:38,350
- Oh, thank God.
- Are you all right?

340
00:38:38,436 --> 00:38:42,429
- Yeah. This nightmare's finally over, right?
- Yes. Yes, I promise.

341
00:38:42,516 --> 00:38:44,507
OK.

342
00:38:45,116 --> 00:38:47,631
Agent Bauer, the chopper's waiting for you.

343
00:38:47,716 --> 00:38:50,675
My family's been through hell.
I want them to fly with me.

344
00:38:50,756 --> 00:38:53,190
- That'll be fine. Come on.
- OK.

345
00:38:53,277 --> 00:38:55,268
- Sweetheart, put this on.
- OK.

346
00:40:23,438 --> 00:40:28,035
Jack and his family were rescued.
They should be here in 10 minutes.

347
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:34,670
Good news. But we need to move fast on
something else. A lead from Jamey's mom.

348
00:40:34,759 --> 00:40:37,432
- Where was the money from?
- An offshore bank account.

349
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:40,272
- We traced the funds to Belgrade.
- Belgrade?

350
00:40:40,359 --> 00:40:43,431
Before I tell you,
upgrade the threat assessment on Palmer.

351
00:40:43,519 --> 00:40:47,513
- You need to give me more than that...
- The same account shows a transfer of funds

352
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:49,716
to an assassin based in Belgrade.

353
00:40:49,799 --> 00:40:51,995
That's old news. The photographer.

354
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:56,790
No. Our contact over there says
this assassin left Yugoslavia this morning.

355
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,348
Which means he's probably already here.

356
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,389
- A second hitter.
- Mm-hm.
