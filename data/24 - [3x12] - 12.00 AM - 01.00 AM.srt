1
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,236
- Hello, Sherry.
- David.

2
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,757
Alan's determined to see Wayne removed.
Even if it means destroying my presidency.

3
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:23,912
You want me to find
something you can use against Alan.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,279
You think you can enlist your ex-wife to
manufacture lies in order to bring me down?

5
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,874
You want it to stop,
stay away from my brother.

6
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,952
<i>Jack, I think it's Amador.</i>

7
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,430
I've got the product.
There's an old mine east of Posta Mita.

8
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,193
Meet me in there in an hour and ten minutes.

9
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,114
I'll have one man with me for security.
You may do the same.

10
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,471
<i> We are following through.</i>

11
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:51,075
<i>-  There are too many risks now.
- They are in the playbook.</i>

12
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,354
CTU, Dessler.

13
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,989
<i> Ramón, if you want this deal
to happen, we've gotta go now.</i>

14
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:59,038
Tony, Jack's on the line.
He's using his cell as a one-way.

15
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,350
<i>Amador's gonna be at Posta Mita in an hour.</i>

16
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,195
It's gonna take us that long to get there
and get your men into position.

17
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,679
He's disconnected.

18
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,911
Based on what CTU got,
the meeting will probably take place here.

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,070
My forward position is gonna be here.

20
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:17,358
I need you to put your men behind this ridge
until we know that the virus is real.

21
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,671
- How long will it take them to get there?
- 90 seconds.

22
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,478
Good luck.

23
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,757
Ramón, if you want this deal to happen,
we have to leave now.

24
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,990
We have to be there
20 minutes before Amador.

25
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,116
The deal is off!

26
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,039
We're leaving now.

27
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,994
Hector!

28
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,710
- Are your people ready?
- Yeah.

29
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,314
- What about Chloe?
- Yeah, she's there, too.

30
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:04,552
This is our chance to get the virus.
Make sure they're aware of what's at stake.

31
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,791
- They're aware.
- It'll all come down in the next hour.

32
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,269
- You don't have to keep reminding me.
- I do.

33
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:15,195
Too many things can go wrong here.
We don't need another mistake.

34
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,759
So, um...

35
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,438
Have we had any word from Jack
in the last few minutes?

36
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,195
No. He's still with Nina and the Salazars.

37
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,034
You should have listened to me.

38
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,910
This is my business. I built it. And I won't let
anyone destroy it. Not even you.

39
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,878
Ramón.

40
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:05,833
- We gotta get him to a hospital.
- We can't. They'll ask questions.

41
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,591
- He'll die if we don't.
- I know.

42
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,115
Ramón.

43
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:39,115
Ramón, I'm sorry, but we have to go.

44
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:46,752
When we are done.
I want him to have a proper burial.

45
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:55,197
Ramón, you're making a big mistake.
He's setting you up. He works for CTU.

46
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,750
Hector was right. You should give this up.

47
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,396
That's enough.
Don't mention my brother's name. Ever.

48
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:17,753
All right. Let's do the deal.
Everybody back in the cars. Come on.

49
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,437
<i> Coordinate with CTU.
I want updates every half-hour.</i>

50
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,715
<i> Yes, sir.</i>

51
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,228
- Yes?
- David.

52
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,995
I just want you to know that I'm leaving.

53
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:21,716
- This leverage you have with Milliken.
- It's better that you don't know the details.

54
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,949
All right.

55
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:32,112
Aaron told me that you refused
a Secret Service escort.

56
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:37,399
Yes. But that's because the person I'm going
to see might scare if I don't come alone.

57
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,870
Don't worry about me.
I can take care of myself.

58
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,396
I know you can.

59
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,554
- David.
- Mm-hm?

60
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,473
I still believe in your presidency.

61
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:00,190
And if Alan Milliken is threatening
your ability to lead this country,

62
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,919
he will be stopped.

63
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,475
Amador will be here in 30 minutes.

64
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:24,475
We have Delta teams ready to intercept the
package when Jack confirms it has the virus.

65
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,233
- Jack's transmitter working yet?
- We're using Chase.

66
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,357
He's moving into a covert position
to give confirmation.

67
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:33,989
- He can transmit to us and the Delta teams.
- Who's running his comm?

68
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:39,393
I am. I wrote a software bridge. I'm amplifying
the low-frequency signal and relaying it out.

69
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,754
OK. Good.

70
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:44,879
Chase'll let us know when the transaction's
complete and Jack has the virus.

71
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:49,078
Our units will move in,
taking full precautions to keep that virus safe.

72
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,835
Ramón, you have to get your men
out of sight before Amador arrives.

73
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,354
I know. Take Nina and send her inside.

74
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,908
<i>- Hombres, vengan acá.
- Enseguida.</i>

75
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,312
<i> Give me the map. I want
some men over here and some over there.</i>

76
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,119
Tell them to keep their eyes open.

77
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,509
Ramón, he's setting you up. I can prove it.

78
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,591
<i>Luis, espera.</i>

79
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,479
Really? How?

80
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:18,395
I was at CTU for seven years, I know
their protocols. I know how they'll play this.

81
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,948
- I'm listening.
- Their attack teams won't be close.

82
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:24,635
They'll have one man doing reconnaissance.
He'll be watching now.

83
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,518
- You know where he would be?
- There's some high ground.

84
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,637
I bet he's there,
or 90 degrees west at the tree line.

85
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,315
We'll know soon enough.
Felipe, Pablo, check it out.

86
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,631
Make your approach from the sides
in case the woman is right.

87
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,712
I am right.

88
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,791
<i>Vámonos.</i>

89
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,229
- Kim, go over these format changes.
- Yeah.

90
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,437
Here, you're gonna need these files
for the repagination.

91
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,592
- What is that?
- It's a baby.

92
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,750
I can see that it's a baby. Whose is it?

93
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,319
- Chloe's.
- Chloe's?

94
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,755
Her baby-sitter
must have had an emergency...

95
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,717
- Chloe doesn't have a baby.
- She does.

96
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,872
She doesn't. I was in the search team
when Chloe got hired.

97
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:17,396
I did her background checks -
personal and medical histories.

98
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:22,554
- And she's never had a baby?
- No. It's definitely not her kid.

99
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,794
Felipe, Pablo. Call me with your positions.

100
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,348
<i>-  It's Felipe.
- Where are you?</i>

101
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,355
<i>- At the tree line. There's no one here.
- Pablo, what about you?</i>

102
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,430
Pablo.

103
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:18,398
Pablo, can you hear me?

104
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,555
They got to him.

105
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:27,109
- Pablo.
- He's dead. They're coming for you next.

106
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,236
What's going on?

107
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,709
What did you say to him?

108
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,275
What did you say to him?

109
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:39,275
<i> Ramón. It's me. I'm at the high ground.</i>

110
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,955
- Do you see anything?
- No. There's no one here.

111
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:47,716
Right. Good. Hold your position.
And keep your eyes open.

112
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,358
OK.

113
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,075
Drop the walkie.

114
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:59,037
No more lies from you.

115
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,115
Amador will be here in 15 minutes.

116
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:10,113
Confirm he has the virus, give him
his money and bring the virus back to us.

117
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,237
You'll have one of my men with you
as your bodyguard.

118
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:17,950
But if you try to escape, or communicate
anything to Amador, he will kill you.

119
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:22,830
If he misses, there are three men in the hills
with sniper rifles aimed at your head.

120
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:26,276
If you want to live,
make sure this deal happens.

121
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,236
- Understood.
- Good.

122
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,517
How's Angela?

123
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,148
Adam just told me
you're not the mother of this child.

124
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,708
Who does the baby belong to?

125
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,040
- My boyfriend, Eric.
- Eric?

126
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:16,033
- Binder. Eric Binder.
- So why isn't he taking care of his daughter?

127
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:21,148
Cos it's the first place his ex-wife would look.
His ex-wife has custody of the baby.

128
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,834
She's seeing this guy
with a drinking problem,

129
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,559
then Eric found out that
he was abusing the baby.

130
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:30,838
- Why doesn't the ex-wife stop the boyfriend?
- She's in some kind of denial.

131
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:34,356
So why doesn't he call
Child Protective Services?

132
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,318
Eric has.

133
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:43,032
The social worker couldn't make it until
tomorrow. He's afraid that'll be too late.

134
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,318
- Wait. So he's kidnapping Angela?
- Technically. But just for tonight.

135
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,153
I don't care, Chloe. Kidnapping is a felony.

136
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,310
You wanna call the police, go ahead.

137
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:57,110
But if something bad happens, then that's
on you. So think about that. Think about it.

138
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,919
Chloe. Tony needs you.
Chase is transmitting.

139
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,391
- I'll be down there in a minute.
- No, he needs you now.

140
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,436
Is there a problem?

141
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,190
- No. No problem.
- Good.

142
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,355
Let me know how much
of her bottle she takes.

143
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,879
- Mr Kelly?
- Yeah. Come on in.

144
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,835
- Drink?
- Um...

145
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,990
No. Thank you.

146
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,509
We appreciate your help on this, Mr Kelly.

147
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,670
"We" meaning you and the president?

148
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:06,548
I am representing the president on this, yes.

149
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,111
So...

150
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,999
What can I tell you?

151
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,514
You can tell me what really happened.

152
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,716
What do you think happened?

153
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:24,796
I think Alan Milliken was driving the car
that hit and killed your daughter 12 years ago.

154
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,473
I... I wouldn't know.

155
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:35,829
You testified that you didn't see anything,
but I think you did.

156
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,708
And I think what you saw implicates Milliken.

157
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,510
Three weeks after your daughter's death,

158
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:55,630
an account was set up in your name at
Maritime Bank and a large deposit was made.

159
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,915
That was to keep your mouth shut, wasn't it?

160
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:05,395
This is a chance for you
to set everything right.

161
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,831
Yeah.

162
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,596
I saw Milliken driving the car that night.

163
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,956
Got the licence plate and everything.

164
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:26,470
But when I told that to the cop,
he takes me aside and he says:

165
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,913
"Your daughter's dead."

166
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,992
"Nothing you can do about that now."

167
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,238
"But if you keep your mouth shut, there's...

168
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,708
there's a payoff. A big one."

169
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:47,632
So I said I didn't see who killed my daughter.

170
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,158
It was blood money and I took it.

171
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,833
Mr Kelly.

172
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:13,950
Mr Kelly, we are gonna
have a press conference.

173
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:19,875
And you are gonna have a chance
to tell your story to everyone.

174
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:23,396
- I'm not gonna be doing this for nothing.
- How much money...

175
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:26,392
I don't want money.
I've already made that mistake.

176
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,755
OK, I'm sorry. Then what do you want?

177
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,149
My son.

178
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:36,271
My only living child.
He's doing a prison term, life sentence.

179
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,920
I want the president to pardon him.

180
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,232
- What was he convicted for?
- Murder. He's all I've got.

181
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:49,316
You get him outta prison, and I'll tell anyone
who wants to listen what really happened.

182
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,354
I don't care what Ramón thinks,
I know you're still working with CTU.

183
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:08,156
You don't know anything. My interests
coincide with Ramón's, and he knows it.

184
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,959
You've convinced everybody,
but I don't believe it.

185
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:14,589
Keep shooting your mouth off,
you're gonna get yourself killed.

186
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:17,672
Once he gets the virus,
he's gonna kill us both.

187
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,877
<i> Get the rest of the guns
outside.</i>

188
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,637
Uncuff her. She needs to get going.

189
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,711
Get the briefcase.

190
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,268
If there is trouble, kill her first.

191
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,710
<i> She's got one of
Salazar's bodyguards with her.</i>

192
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:06,875
Michelle, send the teams to their final marks.
Everybody get set, this is it.

193
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,512
<i> Myers and Salazar's men
are holding 300m away.</i>

194
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,989
<i>- Edmunds is still on point.
- No activity.</i>

195
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:30,595
Make sure the Delta commander
has his field protocol straight.

196
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,079
Almeida.

197
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,311
It's Kim. I need to talk to you in private.

198
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,674
Right now?

199
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:40,150
Yeah. It's about Chloe. It's important.

200
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,870
All right. Tech One.

201
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,951
Keep me posted.

202
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:51,679
You want me to pardon this man's son,
a convicted murderer.

203
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:58,438
I know I'm asking a lot, David, but unless you
pardon Kelly's son, he's not gonna help us.

204
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,909
And how exactly is he supposed to help us?

205
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,120
12 years ago, Kelly was paid off not to
come forward as a witness against Milliken.

206
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:09,237
- What did he witness?
- Milliken killing his daughter,

207
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:13,313
while driving drunk.
Then drove off. Hit and run.

208
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:17,871
Kelly was the only witness. Milliken got
to him before the police report was filed.

209
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:21,270
- And he'll swear to this?
- All you have to do is pardon his son.

210
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:27,469
<i>His name is Patrick Kelly. He's already served
four years of a life sentence.</i>

211
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,551
I'll have to get back to you on this.

212
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,471
Just hurry, OK?

213
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,270
- What do you think?
- You know what I think.

214
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,999
You shouldn't be involved in this, David.

215
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,913
Give in to Milliken. Accept my resignation.

216
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,551
I told you. I am not Milliken's puppet
and I will not let him dictate my decisions.

217
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:56,351
You're gonna let your ex-wife convince you
to grant a quid pro quo pardon to a murderer.

218
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:00,831
She's only been back in your life
for a few hours and look what's happening.

219
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:03,514
I thought you'd be in favor
of what she's proposing.

220
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:08,549
Of you abusing the power of your office?
Absolutely not, David. It is wrong.

221
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:16,599
When you wanted me to pay hush money
to Anne's ex-husband, that was justified?

222
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,716
The difference is that...

223
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:25,472
David, I have your best interests at heart.
You know that.

224
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:30,591
I'm sorry, but Sherry has her own,
and she always has.

225
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,668
Your loyalty, which I am grateful for,

226
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:42,710
does not change the fact that when
someone wants to get down in the mud,

227
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,792
the only way to fight back
is to get down in it with them.

228
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,713
So you're gonna grant the pardon?

229
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,397
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

230
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,993
- What is it?
- There's something you need to know.

231
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,674
If this is about Chloe's baby,
I don't have time.

232
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:09,154
It's not her baby. Chloe does not have a baby.
And, frankly, I think she's delusional.

233
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:13,711
- What are you talking about?
- Look, Chloe does not have a child.

234
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:16,872
I confronted her.
She said this was her boyfriend's baby,

235
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,350
and that the mother of this child
was letting her get abused.

236
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:24,831
I spoke to Child Protective Services.
They said there was no abuse claim filed.

237
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,434
- You sure?
- Positive.

238
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:33,468
- Have you talked to her since you found out?
- No. When I confronted her, she was losing it.

239
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:38,031
Look, this is what I'm worried about -
I think she's unstable.

240
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,959
Kim.

241
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:53,511
- I need you to take a step back here.
- My father and Chase's lives are in her hands.

242
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,036
- That's why we can't do anything now.
- What do you mean?

243
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,111
Chloe is our only lifeline.

244
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,715
She's the only one capable
of filtering Chase's audio streams.

245
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,712
- If Chloe is unstable...
- We don't have an alternative.

246
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,553
We have got to keep her in place.

247
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,949
What about the baby?

248
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:16,512
Whoever her parents are, they must
be going out of their minds right now.

249
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:22,596
Take care of that baby until this operation
is over. I do not want Chloe distracted.

250
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:28,550
I'm not happy about this.
Let's hope Chloe holds it together.

251
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:33,589
We'll deal with the baby
once we get possession of the virus.

252
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,191
Mr Kelly?

253
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,992
Mr Kelly?

254
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,511
Mr Kelly?

255
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:17,275
Hold on, I hear something.
It's a car approaching.

256
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,590
Chase is reporting a car approaching.

257
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:24,037
<i>Salazar's men are sitting tight. No sign
of Amador's men and no other vehicles.</i>

258
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:24,916
Chase.

259
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:30,235
I've got a visual. Two men inside.

260
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,672
<i>It's Amador and his bodyguard.</i>

261
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,716
Ramón.

262
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,791
Amador's arriving.

263
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:46,550
<i> They're exiting the car.
Amador's got a case in his hand.</i>

264
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,471
- Where's Delta?
- 90 seconds away.

265
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:52,519
No one makes a move
until we're sure it's the virus. Understood?

266
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,272
Understood.

267
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,672
- Do you have it?
- Yes.

268
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,478
Good.

269
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:03,233
The transfer protocol
is in place with the bank?

270
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:07,359
I'll transfer the funds
once I've verified the virus. So let's see it.

271
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:14,549
It looks like he's gonna
give her the virus now.

272
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,914
<i> He's taking a canister from the case.</i>

273
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,514
<i>He's unscrewing the lid.</i>

274
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:54,154
It should take about five minutes
to confirm it's the virus.

275
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,710
We don't have enough audio filters.

276
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:19,236
- The library on étude three, should I use it?
- Yeah.

277
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:23,432
- Mr Palmer, this is Tony Almeida.
- Give me an update.

278
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:27,513
The exchange of the virus hasn't happened
yet. We expect it at any moment.

279
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:31,434
The Pentagon is furious at having
to play catch-up. I don't blame them.

280
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,717
This operation began as a secret
between three CTU agents,

281
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:38,918
and, I reiterate, when this is over,
the president will hold you accountable.

282
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,834
I understand. But if you're reprimanding me,
you're doing us both a disservice.

283
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:46,879
- I need to focus on this operation.
- This operation, how large is it?

284
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,918
We have six Delta teams,
waiting for the signal to go in.

285
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,275
<i>- Will that be sufficient?
- It has to be.</i>

286
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:55,272
Any more bodies down there,
we risk being spotted.

287
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,670
- Tell me what's gonna happen.
- We don't have time for this.

288
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:02,070
You've asked the president
to support you on this and he has.

289
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:06,836
You put him way out on a limb here.
He wants to know what the plan is.

290
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:10,754
Michael Amador, the seller,
will hand the virus over to Nina Myers.

291
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:13,718
He doesn't know that Myers
is now under our control.

292
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,792
After the exchange,
Delta teams move in, secure the virus,

293
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,759
take Nina Myers, Michael Amador
and Ramón Salazar into custody.

294
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:23,434
A lot of things are gonna have to go perfectly.

295
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,990
That's true. But we're pretty sure
we have our bases covered.

296
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:30,914
Pretty sure isn't good enough.
You make this happen.

297
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,071
Yes, sir.

298
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,359
How much longer?

299
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:41,070
Chase is watching. Myers is still testing
to confirm that it is the Cordilla virus.

300
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,752
Tell me when he sees movement.

301
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:45,070
- I know to do that, Tony.
- Then do it.

302
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:48,072
- I put an extra filter in your volume.
- I don't need it.

303
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,833
- You asked for it.
- I found a plug-in that worked.

304
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:56,392
- Why not tell me instead of wasting my time?
- Leave me alone, Adam.

305
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,511
Tony.

306
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,795
Yeah.

307
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,589
- Some things about Chloe concern me.
- I know about the baby.

308
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:17,595
Are we right to let her run point on this? If we
make any mistakes, we could lose the virus.

309
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:21,275
Adam, channel two is floating.
Use a phase loop to lock it down.

310
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,272
OK. Just do what she says.

311
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:34,269
- What's the matter?
- They changed the access code to Division.

312
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,351
Yeah. Here.

313
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,393
There.

314
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,471
Thanks.

315
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,994
<i> OK, we're on.</i>

316
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:59,150
<i> The testing device is finishing.</i>

317
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,834
<i>- What's going on?
- They're about to get confirmation.</i>

318
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,077
The signatures match.

319
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:13,118
- It's the virus. It is the virus.
- Send Delta in.

320
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,997
Delta teams, green light. Go!

321
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:19,035
I'll take that.

322
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,953
Until the funds are in place.

323
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:47,996
<i>-  Transfers.
- Fund transfer locater 65-1911374.</i>

324
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,753
<i>Waiting to confirm.</i>

325
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:55,516
Your bank is on the phone
to confirm the transfer of the funds.

326
00:29:55,600 --> 00:30:00,230
<i>- Yes?
- 65-1911374 verified.</i>

327
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,788
<i>- Thank you.
- You're welcome.</i>

328
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,629
Our business is done.

329
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:10,234
Good luck.

330
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:20,316
Amador is out of the building. He's left
the case containing the virus with Nina.

331
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:27,998
<i>They're in the car.
Turning around, heading north.</i>

332
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:32,280
- Have a Delta unit pick him up.
- OK.

333
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:35,309
<i> Nina's on her way.</i>

334
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,596
<i>She's carrying the...</i>

335
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:41,592
- What did he say?
- He thinks Nina's leaving with the virus.

336
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:45,508
- What is wrong?
- The channel's modulating.

337
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:49,991
- I know. I'm switching to Sat 9.
- What? In the middle of a meet?

338
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,878
- What's going on here?
- It'll be fine in a second.

339
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,190
- Switch it back to Sat 3.
- No.

340
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,396
- Are you crazy?
- Sat 3 is out of range.

341
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:01,155
It had a glitch in its software.
I had to switch it or we would have lost it.

342
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,993
Chase, do you copy?

343
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,998
Chase, do you copy?

344
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:17,672
- We should be getting a clear signal now.
- Chase, do you copy?

345
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,631
Chase, do you copy?

346
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:27,999
Yeah, I copy. Nina's still in visual range
and she's headed towards the building.

347
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:31,277
Delta's 50 seconds away.

348
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:36,236
Let's go.

349
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,111
Good job.

350
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,590
Ramón, we should go.

351
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,560
No, Jack. I don't need you any more.

352
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:12,313
He's gonna kill him.
Delta teams won't get there.

353
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:15,119
- We had a deal.
- My brother died because of you.

354
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,670
Chase.

355
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,074
Chase!

356
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,991
<i>- Chase, come in.
- Delta's here.</i>

357
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,832
I'm moving in.

358
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,391
Ramón!

359
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:18,315
Salazar's on the move with the virus.
Repeat, he has the virus.

360
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:23,394
He's headed west between the buildings.
Jack is in pursuit.

361
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:31,550
You two, you're with me. All men in pursuit.
Repeat, Salazar has the virus.

362
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:05,112
- Hello.
- Hello, Julia. It's Sherry Palmer.

363
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,589
I'm sorry to call so late. Are you alone?

364
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:11,389
Yes. It is very late, Sherry.
Why are you calling?

365
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,755
I know what your husband is doing to David.

366
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:16,513
- I can't do anything about that.
- That's not true.

367
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:20,639
You don't see any reason to do anything,
but I'm gonna give you a reason.

368
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:24,429
- What are you talking about?
- I know your situation, Julia.

369
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:30,516
Alan is too controlling to let you go. You're
not willing to sacrifice everything to get out.

370
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,875
You're making assumptions. I'm hanging up.

371
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:37,158
No. I'm telling the truth and you know it.
But I can help you, Julia.

372
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:40,755
I can help you get away from Alan
without giving everything up.

373
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:43,638
- This is ridiculous.
- You know me, Julia.

374
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:48,350
When I say I can make something happen,
you better believe I can.

375
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:54,597
- How would you do this?
- We need to meet in person.

376
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:56,716
<i>- When?
- It has to be now.</i>

377
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,190
I can't leave at this time
without Alan wondering what I'm doing.

378
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,430
Then I'm coming to you.

379
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:12,438
<i>Jack, hold your fire.</i>

380
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:15,080
- Chase?
- Yeah.

381
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:18,357
- You're all right.
- Yeah, I'm all right.

382
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:23,912
Our first priority is the virus. Ramón is our
second. Anybody gets a visual, do not fire.

383
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,149
Copy.

384
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:28,277
I lost him down the path.
If I were him, I'd head north.

385
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:31,636
Headed north, he'll run into the river.

386
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:36,271
Give the chopper our coordinates. Send a
team down the path in case he doubles back.

387
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:39,830
Four of you down that path.
I want two of you with me.

388
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:44,038
Ramón is in possession of the virus.
He's headed north of position 453.6.

389
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:46,350
<i> Roger. 453.6.</i>

390
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:54,391
<i> This is Air One.
We have visual confirmed.</i>

391
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:06,435
<i> It's over, Ramón.
There's nowhere else for you to go.</i>

392
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:11,715
- I'm not going back to jail.
- Put the cylinder down and we'll talk about it.

393
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:14,792
Stop, Jack. There's nothing to talk about.

394
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:19,239
Put the cylinder down!

395
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:23,555
I don't want to have to shoot you.
Just put the cylinder down.

396
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,790
- Jack, say the word.
- Not now.

397
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:30,598
Ramón, I have the authority to cut a deal.
All we want is the virus.

398
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:33,558
Just put the cylinder down slowly.

399
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:38,111
Please. I don't want to shoot you.

400
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:48,079
There you go.
Just put it on the ground nice and easy.

401
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,950
Good.

402
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:11,476
- Chase, are you all right?
- Yeah.

403
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,755
Gimme your phone.

404
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:25,674
<i>-  CTU.
- Bauer. Patch me through to Almeida now.</i>

405
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:30,434
<i>-  What's going on, Jack?
- We do not have the virus.</i>

406
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:34,399
The cylinder was rigged with a bomb.
Amador must have switched it.

407
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:37,119
- Do we have a position on him?
- Delta's on him.

408
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,795
It must have been Amador's plan,
which means he has an escape route.

409
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,075
- Advise Delta team.
- We're on him.

410
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:46,232
Tony, Nina Myers is out there too.

411
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:49,039
- Any chance she was involved?
- No. The bomb was for her.

412
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:52,951
Delta has Amador pinned.
They're 2km west of you, Jack.

413
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:56,112
Copy that. We're moving.
Chase, get your team ready.

414
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:59,397
Two clicks to the west. Split the road.

415
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,791
Copy, Delta Three.

416
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,432
Get out of the vehicle now!

417
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,391
Hands in the air.

418
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,514
Move a muscle, you're dead.

419
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:08,155
Very slowly, get on the ground.

420
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:13,079
Do it now!

421
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,394
Go.

422
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:19,430
Tony, the Delta unit's been taken out.
Amador's escaped.

423
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:22,557
Amador's cellphone signal
just went completely dead.

424
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,358
Jack.

425
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:27,352
<i>- Jack, come in.
- Yeah, this is Bauer.</i>

426
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:30,113
<i>Amador ambushed Delta Three.</i>

427
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,555
<i>- It was a setup.
- Do you have a position?</i>

428
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:36,030
We were tracking him by his cellphone signal.
We lost it in the ambush.

429
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,314
Satellite?

430
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:40,437
No. There's no visual satellite coverage
of this area.

431
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:43,080
Son of a bitch. Copy that.

432
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:46,277
Delta Three's been taken out.
They don't have Amador's position.

433
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,669
- What do you wanna do?
- We gotta find Nina.

434
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:52,196
Take a team up to the high ground.
I'll cover down here.

435
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:54,919
You guys, come on. We'll find her.
