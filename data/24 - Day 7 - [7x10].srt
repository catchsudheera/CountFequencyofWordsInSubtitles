24 - Season 7
Episode 10

4
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:14,120
***

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,800
Madam president, we have your husband, but
he sustained a gunshot wound to the chest.

6
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:22,060
Is my husband going to be okay?

7
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,180
We're not going to know anything
until the doctors see him.

8
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:26,370
Since your husband was the only
leverage that Dubaku had left,

9
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:28,510
it's safe to say that he's
trying to leave the country now.

10
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:31,110
Whatever we're going to do to find
him, we're going to have to do it fast.

11
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:34,490
Whatever it takes, I want
that son of a bitch found!

12
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:38,200
Have someone find my daughter,
Olivia, and bring her to me.

13
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:42,350
What is it that's so important for my mother to
steal me away while I'm trying to do business?

14
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:44,580
It's your father. He's been shot.

15
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:46,880
My, god, I ...

16
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:49,870
Do you think I'm a fool, Mr. Burnett?

17
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,280
If anything should happen to
me on my way out of the country,

18
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:55,290
a data file with all the names and
bank transactions of all those involved

19
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,790
will be sent to the justice department.

20
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,760
You told me that once Dubaku served
his purpose, you'd take him out.

21
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,260
Why are we still helping him?

22
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:07,740
He's threatening to expose us using a database he's
kept with names and accounts of everyone involved.

23
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:08,920
Including mine?

24
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:11,800
We don't know where the file is, so
you just better pray that he gets away.

25
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,340
I'm begging you, Marika ...

26
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:16,170
- FBI! Don't move!
- Get on your knees! Now!

27
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:18,420
- Where is Dubaku?
- Who?

28
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:20,710
Don't play games with me! Ike Dubaku!

29
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,790
You know this man?

30
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:23,870
She was going to meet him.

31
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:26,150
When the car arrives, we would
like you to go with the driver,

32
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,200
so that we could follow
you back to Dubaku.

33
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:30,260
You want her to go to him and face him?

34
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:33,400
It's the only chance we have of finding
him before he disappears forever.

35
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:34,530
I'll do it.

36
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:36,540
You keep her safe, you hear me?

37
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:37,580
We will.

38
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,330
You're less than a mile
behind the target car.

39
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:42,800
I got metro pds trying to
build a roadblock around us.

40
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:47,330
We can't afford to lose them, Jack!

41
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:49,740
I gave this woman my
word we'd protect her.

42
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,760
Get out of the car, right now!

43
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:56,030
Federal agent! She's a federal agent!

44
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:59,330
Your girlfriend's
been turned by the FBI.

45
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,470
If you let her come to you, you're
risking your chances of escape.

46
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,650
I'll call my driver,
have him take care of her.

47
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:07,780
No. I'll take care of her.

48
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:12,780
***

49
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,850
Yes, it's under my authority.

50
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:30,130
Sean, I need to talk to you.

51
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,060
- Is it important?
- You tell me.

52
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:34,870
- Did you issue a federal warrant on this vehicle?
- What?

53
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,370
I found a digital footprint on
server four's backup partition.

54
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,850
It originated from your station.

55
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:41,380
- I'd like to know what the hell is going on!
- Keep your voice down.

56
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:43,510
You want to get us caught?

57
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,910
I sent out the warrant, to
sideline Bauer and Renee.

58
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:49,070
They were closing in on Dubaku.

59
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:50,970
I thought you said Dubaku's
on his way out of the country?

60
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:53,370
He is, but his
girlfriend's talking to FBI.

61
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:55,660
They used her to track him.

62
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:58,270
- Oh, my god.
- Don't worry, i took care of it.

63
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,860
Bauer and Renee are in police custody.

64
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:03,030
By the time they're released,
Dubaku will be long gone.

65
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:04,180
Are you sure?

66
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:05,350
I'm positive.

67
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:07,830
Why didn't you just tell
me what was happening?

68
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:12,740
'Cause I knew you'd react like this.

69
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:15,610
The last thing I need right
now is one of your meltdowns.

70
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:20,380
Now, listen, I got you into this, and I'm going to
get you out of it, but not if you start panicking.

71
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:23,390
- You've got to keep it together.
- I'm just really scared, you know?

72
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,280
I know. I am, too. I'm just a little
better at hiding it than you are.

73
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,720
I've got everything covered.

74
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:32,390
I ran a bounce-tap into the conference
room speakerphone that they'll never find,

75
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,080
and I can hear
everything they're saying.

76
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:37,860
Now, sit at your station.
Try and act normal.

77
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:43,190
Let me worry about
Bauer and Renee. Okay?

78
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:51,810
The man that we were tracking is
responsible for today's terrorist attack.

79
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:53,760
If you don't let us go,
he's going to get away.

80
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:56,080
Look, my captain's on the
phone with your superior.

81
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,610
You're making a mistake!
You've got to let us go!

82
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,750
That warrant had to be sent out
by one of Dubaku's operatives.

83
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:05,360
I know.

84
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,260
Then Dubaku knows that
Marika is working with us.

85
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:09,920
He will kill her, Jack. We should
not have used her like this.

86
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:11,820
We didn't have a choice.
She was our best asset.

87
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:14,670
She's not an asset,
Jack. She's a human being.

88
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:30,270
Colonel.

89
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:36,000
The FBI is still looking for us, sir.

90
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,620
I'll do this quickly. Wait there for me.

91
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,270
Samuel.

92
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,890
- What is it? Sweetheart, what's wrong?
- Give me your cell phone.

93
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,010
My cell phone?

94
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,010
I know you've been talking to the FBI.

95
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:54,490
You've been working for them, Marika.

96
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:58,410
I don't know what you're talking about.

97
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:02,560
What are you doing?

98
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,260
I trusted you!

99
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,500
How could you do this to me?

100
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,390
The FBI told me who you really are.

101
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,640
About the terrible things you've done.

102
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:23,770
- And you believed them?
- They showed me proof!

103
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:26,940
They showed you lies
created by my enemies!

104
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,580
You don't know me.

105
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,560
And you don't know my country.

106
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,150
I brought peace to Sangala.

107
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:40,660
No. Don't be afraid, huh?

108
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:41,990
It's just ...

109
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:47,750
when I heard what you had done, it was like
you had driven a dagger through my heart.

110
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,470
I'm a forgiving man, Marika.

111
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,890
I still want you to come with me.

112
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:57,350
I want to give you the
life that I promised.

113
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:00,540
I can't go with you.

114
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,780
I don't know who you are.

115
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:06,520
You do. You do.

116
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:11,550
If you look past your fear, you'll see that
I am still the man that you fell in love with.

117
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:17,990
I won't leave without you, Marika.

118
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:29,330
All right.

119
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:44,210
You won't be disappointed. Come.

120
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:47,940
The FBI may be close.

121
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,430
Your story was verified by FBI.

122
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,810
I'm sorry about the misunderstanding.

123
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,440
Did FBI find Marika Donoso?

124
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,400
I don't know. You can ask them yourself.

125
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:59,710
Agent Moss wants to talk to you.

126
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,050
Larry, where are they? Where's Marika?

127
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,670
We lost her cell phone signal.

128
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,510
- What do you mean? What happened?
- Don't know.

129
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,230
- Just went dead about three minutes ago.
- Where?

130
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,200
In an alley on the northeast corner of Ann and
10th street. I'm looking through traffic cams now.

131
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:12,720
All right, we're going to comm. Standby.

132
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,600
They lost Marika's signal.

133
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,200
- That's it.
- There.

134
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:26,840
Jack? We got a make on the car.

135
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:31,090
It's a dark gray jeep grand cherokee, turned
south on 11th street about two minutes ago.

136
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,270
Copy that. Moving to intercept.

137
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:35,450
- Did you see Marika?
- Yes. She got in the car with Dubaku.

138
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,170
Chloe, stay on those traffic cams.

139
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:39,010
I'm on it.

140
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,290
We're ten minutes from the
airfield. Is my plane ready?

141
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,160
Fueled and waiting.

142
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:47,550
Did you take care of the problem?

143
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:50,400
She's had a change of
heart. She's coming with me.

144
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:53,240
Colonel, she was working with the FBI.

145
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,770
You were almost arrested because of her.

146
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,050
She's not your concern.

147
00:07:57,090 --> 00:08:00,080
You just worry about getting
me out of the country.

148
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:05,370
Who was that?

149
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:11,030
It was a government official. He's
been working for me. A very corrupt man.

150
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:14,960
I look forward to no longer
dealing with people like him.

151
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:22,410
I want to spend time with
people I really care about.

152
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,960
They're still on 11th. They just
crossed over to New York Avenue.

153
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:37,200
Copy that.

154
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:38,950
- Come on!
- Jack, they're turning left.

155
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,650
Hold on.

156
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:07,140
- FBI.
- Go! Go!

157
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:11,060
Hold on!

158
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:48,420
Get on top of the car! See
if you can maintain a visual.

159
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:55,590
Marika! Marika!

160
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:03,470
Jack, they crashed!

161
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,650
Go!

162
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,930
Get back in your car!

163
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,680
Larry, Dubaku's vehicle's
been involved in an accident.

164
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:14,050
- We need an ambulance, now!
- Copy.

165
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,970
Back away!

166
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,220
Stay on your knees!
Get on the ground, now!

167
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:28,100
Now!

168
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:36,030
I got Dubaku.

169
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:54,390
Agent Walker, the car is on fire.

170
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:56,890
Get out of there!

171
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:00,420
Get out of there!

172
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:09,770
I gave her my word,
so back off or help me.

173
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:23,220
It's her leg--
it's pinned.

174
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:27,180
Hold on.

175
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:31,480
Pull... pull!

176
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,780
Go!

177
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,720
Jack.

178
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:42,170
Go.

179
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:48,090
You all right?

180
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:57,030
Larry, where is my ambulance?

181
00:11:57,070 --> 00:12:00,110
Dubaku's badly injured. He's
unconscious. I need that ambulance now.

182
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,770
They're on their way, Jack.

183
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:38,950
Admiral Smith estimates we'll have the
capitol of Sangala secured within the hour.

184
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,910
He's surprised how little resistance
our troops have encountered.

185
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:48,730
And you'll be happy to know we have liberated
the refugee camp in Kasanga Province.

186
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:52,560
2,000 civilians are
safe from Juma's forces.

187
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:56,890
Madam president?

188
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:59,020
I'm sorry, Ethan.

189
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:03,560
Oh, my god, Kasanga Province.
That's ... that's very good news.

190
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:08,500
Uh, maybe we should
finish this another time.

191
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:12,280
Can I get you anything, madam president?

192
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:14,480
No, thank you.

193
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:17,820
Would you like to talk about it?

194
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:24,460
What happened to Henry
was my fault, Ethan.

195
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:28,790
He never believed our
son committed suicide.

196
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:31,450
He was right.

197
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:32,930
And I didn't listen to him.

198
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,030
And if I had, we wouldn't
be here right now.

199
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:40,790
Henry wouldn't be fighting for his life,
and we might have exposed this conspiracy.

200
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,170
Our government wouldn't be paralyzed.

201
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,800
I didn't believe Henry,
either. No one did.

202
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:49,950
But I'm his wife.

203
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:53,730
He deserved my trust.

204
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,140
Madam president?

205
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,520
I'm sorry to interrupt.

206
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:01,300
It's all right, Bill. Go ahead.

207
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:05,010
I just spoke to Larry Moss
at FBI. We captured Dubaku.

208
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:07,950
He was seriously injured in a
car crash during the pursuit.

209
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,630
- How bad?
- Critical, nonresponsive.

210
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,190
Jack Bauer and Agent
Walker are with him.

211
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,860
They'll be there to question him
should he regain consciousness.

212
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:19,570
So, you're saying that if Dubaku dies, our
chances of uncovering this conspiracy die with him.

213
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,780
He could be the only one who knows the names of
everyone in the government he's corrupted-- yes.

214
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:27,790
Madam president, given this latest news, I
don't think it's safe for you to remain here.

215
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,840
I strongly urge you to
return to the white house.

216
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:31,670
I'd prefer to stay with my husband.

217
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:34,140
You're too exposed. I can't
effectively protect you.

218
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:36,600
Am I any safer at the white house?

219
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:40,000
My administration has
been corrupted, Bill,

220
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:42,500
and now you're telling me we're
about to lose our only lead.

221
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:46,260
Madam president, I assure you I've taken
every precaution to secure the white house.

222
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,790
It's the safest place
for you to be right now.

223
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:53,500
Henry will be in surgery for
several hours, madam president.

224
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:56,360
There's nothing more we can do here.

225
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:59,500
You are needed in the oval office.

226
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,110
All right.

227
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,540
I'll have the cars brought around.

228
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:11,950
I'll also redirect your daughter's
escorts to the white house.

229
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:13,930
Thank you, Bill.

230
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:21,400
What are we going to do, Ethan?

231
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:25,660
How can we possibly run this government
when we don't know who we can trust?

232
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:29,570
We'll just have to pray Jack Bauer
can get those names from Dubaku.

233
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:36,640
You got him stabilized?

234
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:38,050
Yes, sir. We're
transporting him right now.

235
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,500
Bring him around. I need to talk to him.

236
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:40,720
Sir, he's in no condition
to speak right now.

237
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:43,970
This man has information vital to
national security-- bring him around now.

238
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,510
Now!

239
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,860
One milligram epinephrine.

240
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,790
I know you can hear me.
You're in federal custody.

241
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,590
These paramedics are
trying to save your life.

242
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:01,150
You want them to continue, you're
gonna tell me what I want to know.

243
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:04,630
I want the names of everyone in the united
states government that you've been working with.

244
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:08,380
Come on. You and i both know
the game. It's over for you now.

245
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:11,410
There's no sense in
trying to protect them.

246
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:14,940
You and I, we're both soldiers.

247
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:18,590
I know you don't care about your
own life, but you got a family.

248
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,550
I know where your son is in Sangala.

249
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:22,780
I know where he lives, and I swear
to you, I will track him down,

250
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:27,920
and I will make him suffer, and I will make
sure that he knows his father was responsible.

251
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:31,620
All you got to do to make
me stop is give me the names.

252
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,610
Just give me the names.

253
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:36,430
Don't hurt my family.

254
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:40,170
I have a list ... list.

255
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:42,170
Where is the list?

256
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:44,270
- His bp's spiking.
- Give me the list. Where is the list?

257
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,850
- He's going into cardiac arrest.
- Bring him back!

258
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:50,310
Get the paddles. Start
at 200 joules. clear.

259
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,540
No response-- there's a
glitch. Once more. clear.

260
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:57,220
There it is again.
Electronic interference.

261
00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:00,070
This could be it-- feels like
a metal plate or something.

262
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,980
All right. Amping up to 300. clear.

263
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:04,430
- Where's the plate?
- All right.

264
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,660
He's stabilized--
let's get him boarded.

265
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:08,110
- Where's the plate?
- It's below his rib cage.

266
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,650
Open him up.

267
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:11,350
Sir, we don't have time. I
have to ask you to step aside.

268
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:15,210
You open him up now. Do it.

269
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:34,090
Sir, this man will die if we
don't get him to the hospital.

270
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:36,250
Get him out of here.

271
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:46,520
FBI.

272
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:48,680
Patch me through to Agent Moss.

273
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:50,620
- This is Moss.
- Larry, it's Jack.

274
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:51,330
Go ahead, Jack.

275
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:55,100
I found some kind of digital storage
device implanted under Dubaku's skin.

276
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:56,990
- What is it?
- In an effort to protect his family,

277
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,510
he said he would provide me with a list
of all of his U.S.Government contacts.

278
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:01,880
He said it was on him; he meant, in him.

279
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:04,210
Larry, this is his insurance
policy. I'm sure of it.

280
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:07,570
Jack, we need that data as soon as
possible. Can you upload the files to FBI?

281
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,790
I don't think so. I've
never seen anything like it.

282
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:15,240
Hold on one second. Officer. Officer.

283
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:17,320
My name is Jack Bauer.
I'm working with the FBI.

284
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:19,170
I need you to get this device
to regional headquarters.

285
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:20,900
I want you to give it
to an agent, Larry Moss.

286
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,990
You put this in his hands,
his hands only. You understand?

287
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,630
- Yes, sir.
- Do it.

288
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,260
Larry, you got a
chopper coming your way.

289
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:29,010
You should have the drive in five
minutes. We're gonna stay with Dubaku.

290
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,860
Get back to us as soon
as you got anything.

291
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,340
Copy that.

292
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,280
Sean. What is it? What's wrong?

293
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:48,030
Just listen to me, and
try not to overreact.

294
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:50,840
Okay, we have a situation, but
I think I have a way to handle it.

295
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:53,590
What situation? You told me you
had everything under control.

296
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:57,770
I do ... but they have Dubaku's database.

297
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:59,290
What?

298
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,730
Sean, our names are on that list.You
told me that you were taking care of this,

299
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,120
and now you're telling me
that they have our names?

300
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,540
No, they don't have our
nes yet, so here's the plan.

301
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:08,210
Sean, we have to get out of here.
We have to get out of here right now!

302
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:12,170
- I'm not going to jail, Sean! Do you hear me?
- Nobody's going to jail. I promise.

303
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:14,660
I'm sick of your promises. You promised
me that this is all taken care of.

304
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:16,540
You promised me you're
leaving your wife.

305
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:18,200
You make all these promises,
but you never keep any of them!

306
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:21,740
Stop talking, and just listen to me--
now, I told you I have a way out of this,

307
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,870
but I need your help,
do you understand that?

308
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:26,800
Now, listen ... okay?

309
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:31,600
As soon as O'brian downloads those files,
we're gonna crash the entire system,

310
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:34,150
every single server on this floor.

311
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:35,460
That's crazy.

312
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:38,910
No, it's not crazy. We're gonna
go up to the mainframe room...

313
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:41,990
initiate a system-wide reformat.

314
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:44,870
We'll wipe everything clean, and
they won't be able to stop it.

315
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:48,620
We're gonna have to bypass a
lot of safety protocols, okay?

316
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:52,260
But nobody's better at dealing
with those servers than you are.

317
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:55,530
Isn't that true?

318
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:01,440
I need your help. I
can't do this without you.

319
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,110
Erika?

320
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,730
Yeah. Okay.

321
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:19,620
We're gonna have to ...

322
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:22,500
tie the main servers together.

323
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:27,030
I need an AVI motherboard, but you're gonna
have to reconfigure it for a macro uplink.

324
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,720
Okay, and we have to hurry.

325
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:31,360
The drive is gonna be here any minute.

326
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:33,340
Go up to the mainframe
room and get started.

327
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:35,580
I'm gonna prep the motherboard.
I'll meet you up there.

328
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:37,740
- Okay.
- Okay.

329
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:43,050
We're gonna be fine.

330
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:46,980
I love you.

331
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:52,430
- I love you, too.
- Okay, let's go.

332
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:21,330
These are Marika
Donoso's personal effects.

333
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:25,610
- Thank you.
- Copy that. Get back to me.

334
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:29,780
That was Larry. They got the drive.

335
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:30,990
Chloe's gonna be working on them.

336
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:33,340
They should have something
in the next few minutes.

337
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:35,940
That's all that matters, right, Jack?

338
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,680
I don't like what happened to
Marika any more than you do.

339
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:41,360
We did what was necessary. You better
figure out a way to live with it.

340
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:44,920
How, Jack? Pretend that it never
happened? Is it that easy for you?

341
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,410
I'll let you know when
Chloe's got something.

342
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,850
Here it is.

343
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:08,770
This is a PX-1-7 drive. It's
got an auto-erase function.

344
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,080
We've only got one download.

345
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:35,370
Where have you been?

346
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:37,900
Just took a little
longer than I thought.

347
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:44,290
- What are you doing?
- Checking surveillance.

348
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:47,310
Got to keep an eye on Larry and O'brian.

349
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:50,530
Once we do this, they're gonna realize
someone's up here in a few seconds.

350
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:52,990
We'll have to make a clean exit.

351
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:57,210
How much longer is this going to take?

352
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,930
I just have to bypass safety protocols.

353
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:02,210
Once they're down,
I'll start the reformat.

354
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,320
Go ahead.

355
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,520
Dubaku hasn't arrived at the airfield,
and he's not answering his cell phone.

356
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:12,430
- What's going on?
- FBI got him.

357
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,420
What?

358
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:15,750
How long have you known about this?

359
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:18,210
They're not going to get anything out
of him. He's unconscious in the hospital.

360
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:20,580
There was a crash during a chase.

361
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:24,460
Listen, the FBI recovered that database
you told me about, the list of names.

362
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,800
I'm in the process of deleting it.

363
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,160
I'm going to erase every trace of it.

364
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,200
I don't have to tell you what
will happen if they get that list.

365
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,600
They won't. I'm gonna
take care of the database.

366
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:33,430
You need to take care of Dubaku.

367
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:35,780
- Don't worry about him. You just make sure ...
- Damn it!

368
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:38,100
I got to go. What's wrong?

369
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:40,040
- It-it isn't working. - What
do you mean, it isn't working?

370
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:43,700
All the inputs are active, the servers
are aligned, but the reformat won't start.

371
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:44,870
It doesn't make any sense.

372
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:47,540
Okay, well, just-just think
it through, Erika. Right?

373
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:49,740
- You can do this.
- Would you just shut up? Okay?

374
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:56,900
Okay. Has to be server three. all right,
server three was upgraded last week.

375
00:23:57,420 --> 00:24:01,560
Which means they stored the partitions
to the system default settings.

376
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,130
How could I be so stupid?

377
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:08,970
I just have to configure the parameters.

378
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:11,970
Okay.

379
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:20,320
Okay? Is that it?

380
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:23,400
I think so.

381
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:28,090
Program's running.

382
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,500
What? What's happening? What's going on?

383
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:34,740
- The hard drive's reformatting.
- What?

384
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:36,460
The files are being erased.
We're losing everything.

385
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:38,900
- Well, make it stop.
- I don't have the access.

386
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:42,020
- Get the PX-1-7 out.
- It's too late. It's erased.

387
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:48,870
This is deliberate. It's not a glitch.
Someone's trying to crash the system.

388
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,580
- Where's your mainframe room?
- Come on.

389
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:59,160
Here they come. We
got to get out of here.

390
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:00,750
- Almost there.
- Erika ...

391
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,240
- It's done.
- Are you sure?

392
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:07,410
Yeah. It'll take a few minutes for the reformat
to be complete, but there's no stopping it.

393
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:11,840
- Oh, baby. I knew you could do it.
- Yeah. We gonna be okay?

394
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:16,020
We're gonna be fine.

395
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:48,630
Sorry.

396
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:12,460
- Get on the floor!
- It wasn't me!

397
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:14,920
Get on the floor!

398
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,250
Larry, it wasn't me.

399
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:28,360
Chloe!

400
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,080
Larry, I followed her up here.

401
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:32,220
She was trying to crash the system.

402
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:34,520
She shot me!

403
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:35,890
I went for the weapon, and it went off.

404
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:36,920
Security, this is Agent Moss.

405
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,750
I need a team to lock
down the mainframe room.

406
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:40,490
And get a medic up here!

407
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,700
Chloe, can you recover the files?

408
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:44,410
- I don't know yet.
- What files? What the hell is happening?

409
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:46,230
You tell me what the
hell is happening, Sean!

410
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:48,610
You were shotting me out, Larry,
so I looked around on my own.

411
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:51,490
I found out that Erika was
rerouting the sub-cam channel!

412
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,140
What the hell was she doing?

413
00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:56,210
She sent out a-a warrant on
a vehicle with two suspects.

414
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:58,050
I knew something was wrong.
That's not part of her job.

415
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:00,310
I asked her about it,
and she tried to deny it.

416
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:01,730
She was acting very strangely.

417
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:02,910
Why didn't you say anything?

418
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:06,050
I don't know what the hell it meant,
so I hacked into her hard drive,

419
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:08,430
and I found schematics
for the main server.

420
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:10,890
Bypass codes for the safety protocols.

421
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:13,310
I followed her up here
to see what she was up to.

422
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:18,280
The second I realized she was trying
to crash the system, I-I confronted her.

423
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:20,970
She shot me.

424
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:23,760
I went for the gun.

425
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:26,020
Larry, I didn't mean to kill her.

426
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:29,030
Halt! Halt!

427
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:32,430
Larry, it's too late. The system's
fried. Dubaku's files are gone.

428
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,490
Are you sure? Can you recover anything?

429
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:37,900
The server's wiped
clean. She got everything.

430
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:55,700
Is this everything you got?

431
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:58,470
No, it's not. I didn't have time
to print out every single message

432
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:03,470
that came through Erika's workstation. That's
everything she was doing for the past three days.

433
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:08,120
Look, Larry, I told you what happened.
I feel like you owe me an explanation.

434
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:10,880
What the hell is going on here?

435
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:18,670
The government's been
compromised by Dubaku.

436
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:21,180
FBI, secret service. God knows who else.

437
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:24,090
That's why I shut you out,
brought in Chloe O'brian.

438
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:27,690
We were in the middle of decrypting a file that
had the names of everyone on Dubaku's payroll.

439
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:29,580
Erika erased it when
she wiped the server.

440
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:32,190
That was our only lead.

441
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:35,420
You should have told me about
this. You should have trusted me.

442
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:37,980
Sean, I didn't know who to trust.

443
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,880
You all right? How's your arm?

444
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:44,070
It hurts like hell. It's fine.

445
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,600
When you're up for it, I'm gonna
need you to write a statement.

446
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:47,630
Okay.

447
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:49,880
And keep your mouth shut.

448
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:53,980
We don't know who else in this building
might be working for Dubaku. Yeah.

449
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:55,620
Larry, don't ask me how, but I did it.

450
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:56,360
You did what?

451
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:58,890
I recovered Dubaku's files.

452
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:00,780
What?

453
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:02,920
I was running a mirror
file on an outside server.

454
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,350
I always do that when I'm
dealing with sensitive materials.

455
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:08,620
Erika's parameters were
too narrow to catch it.

456
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:10,720
How soon can you have it decrypted?

457
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,710
It's decrypted. It's been
decrypting this entire time.

458
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,680
Dubaku kept detailed
evidence on everyone.

459
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:17,830
Phone logs, financial
records-- it's all here.

460
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:20,450
Listen, I'm gonna need you to
cross-check with FBI personnel.

461
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,620
Sean said Erika was working by
herself, but I got to be 100% sure.

462
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:26,900
- Okay. Hold on.
- Yeah.

463
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:31,850
Chloe recovered the files.

464
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:35,420
That's great.

465
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,060
- I should get to that statement.
- Yeah.

466
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:42,270
Sean?

467
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:45,530
When you're done there, I want you
to go downstairs and see Dr. Weber.

468
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:48,500
You shot a fellow agent. You're
gonna want to talk to somebody.

469
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:51,070
Yes, sir.

470
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:08,260
Hey, do you have any idea
what's going on with the servers?

471
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:09,330
Not a clue.

472
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:10,400
The whole system's down.

473
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:13,680
I tried to get into the mainframe room,
and security has got it locked off.

474
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,510
Ask Larry about it, Janis.

475
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:17,540
Where are you going?

476
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:20,210
- I got to run an errand.
- Now?

477
00:30:54,570 --> 00:30:58,000
- All right, all right.
- Hold off.

478
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:04,080
You better start
talking to me right now!

479
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:09,180
I'd like to speak with my attorney.

480
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:15,260
Put him in holding.

481
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:24,940
Yes. Sir.

482
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:26,920
Get me Bill Buchanan at the white house.

483
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:43,490
Where is my sister? Where's Marika?

484
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:46,960
There was an accident.

485
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:49,480
What happened?

486
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:51,340
Marika didn't make it.

487
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:53,760
What-what do you mean?

488
00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:57,380
There was a crash. Uh, it
happened during the pursuit.

489
00:31:57,730 --> 00:32:00,440
Marika was killed.

490
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:03,400
I don't understand.

491
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:05,950
You said that you'd protect
her. You said she'd be okay.

492
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:08,840
We wouldn't have caught
Dubaku without Marika's help.

493
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:11,420
She was very, very brave, Rosa.

494
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:15,450
What is this?

495
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:18,400
This is supposed to
make everything okay?

496
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:21,530
Marika was all I had!

497
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:25,230
I trusted you with her
life, and you let her die?

498
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:28,400
- I'm so sorry.
- Don't touch me!

499
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,480
You killed my sister!

500
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:38,590
You didn't care how you
did it or who got hurt!

501
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:44,240
Agent Walker?

502
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:51,550
Excuse me.

503
00:32:58,110 --> 00:33:01,070
I just got o the phone with
Larry. Dubaku wasn't lying.

504
00:33:01,530 --> 00:33:04,770
On the drive was a list of everyone
he was working with in the government.

505
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:08,440
They're getting ready to
make arrests. It's over.

506
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:14,430
It's not over for Rosa.

507
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,090
What happened to Marika was a tragedy.

508
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:23,800
But I'm not going to stand here and tell you
what we did was wrong, because we weren't.

509
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:27,570
She made a choice, a brave one,
to get involved, but she made it.

510
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:31,460
God, listen to yourself, Jack. You don't
even sound human. Don't you feel anything?

511
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:33,290
We had a job to do!

512
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:36,740
To protect the hundreds if not thousands of
innocent lives that would not have had a choice

513
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:39,350
if we let a terrorist attack take place.

514
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:45,070
What we did wasn't
wrong. It was necessary.

515
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:48,260
I read your file.

516
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:52,240
When your wife was killed, did you feel that or
did you just tell yourself that that was necessary?

517
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:55,130
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me?

518
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:56,830
I just want to know
that you feel something!

519
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:59,810
I want to know that you feel
the same kind of pain that I do!

520
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:03,870
Do you feel that? Do you feel that?

521
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:13,890
It's all right.

522
00:34:16,650 --> 00:34:19,500
You're going to be all right.

523
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:23,410
It's going to take a while.

524
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,670
But you will learn to live with it.

525
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:29,070
What if I don't want to
learn to live with it?

526
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:32,350
Then quit.

527
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:37,930
And by the way, that stunt
you pulled by the car ...

528
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:43,770
you ever pull your weapon on my
again, you better intend to use it.

529
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,790
I did.

530
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:17,380
- Olivia.
- What's going on?

531
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:19,740
How's dad?

532
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:23,930
He's still in surgery.
We're waiting for word.

533
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:26,630
Is he going to be all right?

534
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:29,340
He was seriously injured.

535
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:31,870
The bullet went through his lung.

536
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:36,300
Livy.

537
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:40,500
The doctors are doing
everything they can.

538
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,670
Who did this?

539
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,720
It's complicated.

540
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:50,080
I want to know who shot my father!

541
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:55,010
Your father found out about a
conspiracy inside the government.

542
00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:57,050
The people behind it tried to kill him.

543
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:58,230
Who are these people?

544
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:01,130
We're trying to find out right now.

545
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:03,700
That's all i can tell you.

546
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:05,690
Okay, I want to go to the hospital.

547
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:08,210
- I want to be there when he wakes up.
- I can't let you do that.

548
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:11,430
The people who shot your father
are still out there. It's not safe.

549
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,300
I don't care, I want to see dad!

550
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:14,830
This is not a debate.

551
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:16,630
I'm not going to risk
anything happening to you.

552
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:20,010
You're staying in the white
house, and that's the end of it.

553
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:23,100
Madam president, Bill
Buchanan is here to see you.

554
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:25,870
I'll be right out.

555
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,000
There's a lot we need
to talk about, Olivia.

556
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:36,400
We've been ignoring
things for far too long.

557
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:40,000
It took dad getting shot for
you to finally want to talk?

558
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:42,990
Let's not go down this path.

559
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:46,940
Not again. Not today.

560
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:51,460
We'll talk later.

561
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:54,680
One of the guards will take
you up to the residence.

562
00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:05,890
All right, Bill. What is it?

563
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:08,230
I have very good news.

564
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:11,260
Jack Bauer just recovered
a database hidden on Dubaku.

565
00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:14,290
It contains the names of everyone in
the government who was working with him.

566
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,170
How many?

567
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:17,800
Close to a hundred people,
across all agencies.

568
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:19,910
- Some at very high levels.
- My god.

569
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:23,040
Dubaku kept detailed
files on every person.

570
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:25,440
This is exactly what we've been
working toward, madam president.

571
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:28,330
We can finally put an
end to this conspiracy.

572
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,900
I assume you've already begun
acting on this information.

573
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:35,010
Yes. As a matter of fact, Larry Moss
just identified two more individuals

574
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:37,730
working within FBI who were on the list.

575
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,170
He's confident the bureau is secure.

576
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,550
What's the next step?

577
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:44,330
I'm working with FBI to
coordinate an interagency sweep.

578
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,480
We should start making
arrests within the hour.

579
00:37:46,490 --> 00:37:49,760
Bill, I don't know what
to say to thank you.

580
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:53,120
What you have done here today
puts all of us in your debt.

581
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:57,790
I appreciate that, madam president,
but there are a lot of people to thank,

582
00:37:58,030 --> 00:38:00,340
including Jack Bauer.

583
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:05,980
He's scheduled to resume his testimony
before the senate committee tomorrow morning.

584
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,520
I'm aware of that.

585
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:09,370
Madam president, forgive
me if I'm out of line,

586
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:14,330
but I feel senator Mayer is on
a personal crusade against Jack.

587
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:16,670
He's already taken his pound of flesh.

588
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:21,600
He dismantled CTU, attacked the reputations of
people who've served this country with honor.

589
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:24,100
Now he wants to make an example of Jack.

590
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:28,690
It isn't right, madam president,
especially after today.

591
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,550
What are you asking me to do, Bill?

592
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:33,840
I'm asking you to
speak to senator Mayer.

593
00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:36,840
Jack Bauer helped save this country.

594
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:40,290
He doesn't deserve to spend
the rest of his life in prison.

595
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:46,010
I appreciate your sentiments, Bill, but
I'm going to have to think about this.

596
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:49,440
That's all I'm asking,
madam president. Thank you.

597
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,050
What the hell are you doing here?

598
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:26,740
- I need to talk with you.
- About what?

599
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:28,610
I told you I was going
to follow up on a lead.

600
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:31,840
No, you said you were going to turn
yourself in as soon as this was over.

601
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:34,690
And I will. But this ain't over yet.

602
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,690
There's going to be
another attack. Here in D.C.

603
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:39,780
Dubaku is in custody.

604
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:42,580
He's already provided us with a list of eryone
in the government that was working with him.

605
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:44,870
It's not Dubaku.

606
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:47,480
It's his boss, Juma.

607
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:50,910
He knows he's about to
loose control of his country.

608
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:53,870
So he's going to try and rally his people
behind him by striking back at the U.S.

609
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:55,810
How do you know this?

610
00:39:55,870 --> 00:39:58,770
- I tracked down a source.
- What source?

611
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:02,400
He was one of the men I
worked with on Emerson's crew.

612
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:06,260
He had a direct line of communication
with the Juma regime in Sangala.

613
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:12,200
It wasn't easy getting the information out
of him, but I'm convinced it's accurate.

614
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:14,440
- Then you should hand it over to FBI.
- No.

615
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:18,710
My source tells me that the
window opens at 1900 hours.

616
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:23,200
By the time the FBI wades through their
procedures and red tape, it's going to be too late.

617
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:27,580
What's the target?

618
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:30,470
He doesn't know the exact target,

619
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:35,270
but it's definitely going to be
of high value and high impact.

620
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:39,200
He gave me the name of somebody
who's been involved in the planning.

621
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:41,250
Who?

622
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:44,110
Ryan Burnett.

623
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:47,180
Senator  Mayer's chief of staff.

624
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:49,330
That's right.

625
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,100
He's been involved
from the very beginning.

626
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:54,760
- What about Mayer?
- No. He's not involved.

627
00:40:54,770 --> 00:40:57,550
- You're sure about that?
- Yeah.

628
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:03,300
You better not be lying to me, Tony.

629
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:08,520
This is real, Jack.

630
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:12,750
Burnett will be on Dubaku's list.

631
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,540
As soon as he finds out that Dubaku's
in custody, he'll start running.

632
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:16,890
You don't have a lot of time.

633
00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:19,500
I've already got a tail on him.

634
00:41:20,890 --> 00:41:26,990
Listen, Jack, if you're with me, meet me
at the corner of first and constitution.

635
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:39,930
I need your help.

636
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:54,100
Thank you for your patience.

637
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:58,280
As I'm sure some of you already know,
our government and its ancillary agencies,

638
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:04,040
including this office, have been infiltrated
by operatives in league with Ike Dubaku.

639
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,060
Yes, senator?

640
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:10,040
Ryan, can you step in here?

641
00:42:10,050 --> 00:42:11,910
Yes, sir.

642
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,570
- I'm going to the white house.
- Sir?

643
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:27,000
President Taylor wants to speak
to me regarding Jack Bauer.

644
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:29,110
Bauer? What about him?

645
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:32,950
I don't know, but we'll
find out soon enough.

646
00:42:33,610 --> 00:42:35,930
- It's odd, though.
- What is, sir?

647
00:42:36,370 --> 00:42:40,560
Bauer was pulled away from the senate hearings
this morning to help the FBI with an investigation.

648
00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:44,310
And now the president wants
to talk to me about him.

649
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:47,330
I don't like the timing of this.

650
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:50,980
Grab your laptop, Ryan.
I want you there with me.

651
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:53,140
Yes, sir.
