1
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,282
Jack, this is hard for me.

2
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:22,157
<i>The Chinese have proof
that you led the assault on their consul.</i>

3
00:00:22,249 --> 00:00:24,716
<i>- And now the Chinese want me?
- That's right.</i>

4
00:00:24,808 --> 00:00:29,960
The man they sent to take you
into custody has orders to kill you.

5
00:00:30,047 --> 00:00:32,924
<i>- Orders from who?
- Someone in Logan's camp.</i>

6
00:00:33,326 --> 00:00:35,043
Dale Spaulding, Secret Service.

7
00:00:35,125 --> 00:00:38,913
I've orders to take Jack Bauer into custody.
I intend to execute those orders.

8
00:00:42,323 --> 00:00:44,632
Jack.

9
00:00:45,163 --> 00:00:46,357
He's dead.

10
00:00:46,442 --> 00:00:48,910
I'm sorry.

11
00:00:49,002 --> 00:00:51,196
Oh, God, Jack.

12
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,675
Give me the epinephrine.

13
00:00:57,719 --> 00:00:59,675
I hope it's not too late.

14
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:01,989
Come on, Jack.

15
00:01:02,078 --> 00:01:04,716
Come on, Jack. Dammit!

16
00:01:08,637 --> 00:01:10,467
Hey.

17
00:01:10,556 --> 00:01:13,592
Chloe, run interference with the local coroner.

18
00:01:13,675 --> 00:01:15,790
Sync up their database
with Jack's information.

19
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:18,707
- That won't cover the autopsy.
- There won't be one.

20
00:01:18,793 --> 00:01:20,749
They wanted Jack dead. Now he's dead.

21
00:01:21,193 --> 00:01:22,910
Mr. President, you saved my life.

22
00:01:22,993 --> 00:01:24,983
<i>I'm only sorry it came to this.</i>

23
00:01:25,072 --> 00:01:27,950
<i>- I just wanted to let you know that I was out.
- I'm glad.</i>

24
00:01:28,031 --> 00:01:32,785
Jack, you do understand, when you hang up,
for all intents and purposes,

25
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:34,462
Jack Bauer is dead.

26
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:36,301
<i>I understand that, sir.</i>

27
00:01:36,909 --> 00:01:39,547
<i>Mr. President, it's been an honour.</i>

28
00:02:02,022 --> 00:02:04,899
Jim Nichols. You're on pump number one.

29
00:02:05,861 --> 00:02:11,218
Sterling Rush, Patrick Priest,
you're on pump number four.

30
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:15,212
Phil Stone, Greg Nelson, you're on pump five.

31
00:02:17,059 --> 00:02:20,049
Sorry, guys. That's all I got today.

32
00:02:24,976 --> 00:02:30,253
Frank. I know I promised you work today,
but pump seven went off line last night.

33
00:02:30,335 --> 00:02:33,610
- I'll try again tomorrow.
- Tomorrow'll be much better.

34
00:02:33,694 --> 00:02:36,002
See you tomorrow.

35
00:02:43,771 --> 00:02:47,285
<i>The sun is shining, but the air is cool
at President Logan's retreat,</i>

36
00:02:47,371 --> 00:02:51,408
<i>where Russian president Yuri Suvarov
is expected later this morning.</i>

37
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:55,481
Everything worked for me
up until the chapter on your first campaign.

38
00:02:55,568 --> 00:02:59,480
It's a little long-winded,
and I think that we can cut that down by half.

39
00:02:59,567 --> 00:03:03,036
Why don't we start with the paragraph...

40
00:03:06,925 --> 00:03:09,643
You didn't hear a word I just said, did you?

41
00:03:09,725 --> 00:03:12,397
- Yeah. I was listening.
- No, you weren't.

42
00:03:14,123 --> 00:03:16,398
You're right.

43
00:03:16,482 --> 00:03:18,791
- I'm sorry.
- Are you OK?

44
00:03:18,882 --> 00:03:21,111
I can use a break.

45
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,435
- What's going on?
- What do you mean?

46
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:31,307
I mean you've been distracted
ever since you got to Los Angeles.

47
00:03:31,398 --> 00:03:35,276
I don't know - it's like you're somewhere else.

48
00:03:36,557 --> 00:03:38,946
Writing my memoirs,

49
00:03:40,476 --> 00:03:43,706
maybe it's put me in a melancholy mood.

50
00:03:43,795 --> 00:03:46,183
Is that all it is?

51
00:03:46,275 --> 00:03:47,627
Yeah.

52
00:03:50,154 --> 00:03:53,225
David, I'm your brother.

53
00:03:53,912 --> 00:03:57,586
Whatever it is, you can tell me.

54
00:03:59,711 --> 00:04:02,178
It's all right. Really.

55
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:05,544
OK.

56
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:08,018
Well, then, let's get back to work.

57
00:04:08,509 --> 00:04:13,582
One more chapter and we'll take a break.
Why don't we jump down to, um, chapter six?

58
00:04:13,667 --> 00:04:17,215
There'll be questions
about your relationship with Sherry.

59
00:04:21,905 --> 00:04:24,293
David.

60
00:04:26,904 --> 00:04:28,859
Get help!

61
00:04:28,943 --> 00:04:32,059
Stay with me. Stay with me. Get help!

62
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:43,374
Walt. My chair?

63
00:04:43,459 --> 00:04:45,972
- Mr. President. I had it adjusted.
- Good.

64
00:04:46,059 --> 00:04:50,096
- Adjusted? What are we talking about?
Suvarov is over six feet.

65
00:04:50,178 --> 00:04:53,010
He can't be looking down
at the president of the US.

66
00:04:53,097 --> 00:04:56,372
That's a risky proposition.
If the press finds out...

67
00:04:56,456 --> 00:05:00,414
- They won't.
- Don't underestimate the power of image.

68
00:05:00,495 --> 00:05:04,043
Stalin and Churchill,
they both sat for FDR at Yalta.

69
00:05:04,134 --> 00:05:09,126
This will define my administration. We have
to make sure that the media presents it right.

70
00:05:10,292 --> 00:05:12,806
I'll get it.

71
00:05:12,891 --> 00:05:14,722
<i>- Yeah?
- Greg Porter for you.</i>

72
00:05:14,811 --> 00:05:16,289
Put him through.

73
00:05:16,371 --> 00:05:20,567
- Have you checked on my wife?
- She's still getting ready.

74
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:24,800
She'll be fine, sir. I'm in contact with Dr Hill.

75
00:05:26,808 --> 00:05:30,038
I'd feel better
if you would check on her yourself.

76
00:05:30,127 --> 00:05:33,641
She cannot have one of her meltdowns today.

77
00:05:34,646 --> 00:05:37,443
You're the only one she listens to, Walt.

78
00:05:37,525 --> 00:05:39,914
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

79
00:05:45,363 --> 00:05:46,715
Mike?

80
00:05:46,802 --> 00:05:49,441
Mike, what is it?

81
00:05:51,921 --> 00:05:55,117
David Palmer has been assassinated.

82
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,997
- What?
- It just happened.

83
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:01,432
Oh, my God.

84
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:04,396
- Where?
- In LA.

85
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:09,114
I don't believe this.

86
00:06:09,197 --> 00:06:14,349
Mr. President,
CTU is standing by to brief you directly.

87
00:06:15,115 --> 00:06:17,264
Whenever you're ready.

88
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:38,420
- Tell LAPD to set up a perimeter.
- They're sending everyone.

89
00:06:38,509 --> 00:06:39,908
- Witnesses?
- Not yet.

90
00:06:39,988 --> 00:06:42,786
- Who's running search and sweep?
- Secret Service.

91
00:06:42,867 --> 00:06:46,416
Narrow the area. Make sure
Ballistics runs a line-of-fire trajectory.

92
00:06:46,507 --> 00:06:51,181
- Sir, President Logan's ready.
- I'll call Ballistics.

93
00:06:55,064 --> 00:06:58,659
<i>- Put the president through.
- Yes, sir. Go ahead.</i>

94
00:06:58,743 --> 00:07:00,938
<i>- Mr. President.
- Bill.</i>

95
00:07:02,062 --> 00:07:07,533
Not to diminish the loss we're all feeling, but
I am expecting the Russian president soon,

96
00:07:07,621 --> 00:07:09,612
so let's say what needs to be said.

97
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,772
<i>- Of course.
- Have you arrested the person who did this?</i>

98
00:07:12,859 --> 00:07:15,612
<i>- Not yet, sir.
- Then what do you have?</i>

99
00:07:15,699 --> 00:07:18,417
<i>The damage inflicted
by the single shot indicates</i>

100
00:07:18,498 --> 00:07:22,888
<i>that Palmer was hit by a. 308-calibre bullet
fired from an adjacent building.</i>

101
00:07:22,977 --> 00:07:25,366
We've initiated an interagency protocol...

102
00:07:25,457 --> 00:07:29,334
Don't... don't give me protocols, Bill.
Give me results.

103
00:07:29,415 --> 00:07:33,090
Whoever did this, I want them dead
or in custody when the Russians get here.

104
00:07:33,174 --> 00:07:38,371
Until we know more, I would ask that you
consider postponing the signing of the treaty.

105
00:07:38,453 --> 00:07:41,649
No. Absolutely not.

106
00:07:41,732 --> 00:07:47,362
We can't discount the possibility that this
attack is connected to the arms agreement.

107
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:51,159
A former president was assassinated
15 miles from where you are,

108
00:07:51,249 --> 00:07:54,764
and I'm sure I don't need to explain
the significance of this day.

109
00:07:54,848 --> 00:08:00,080
Do you realise the political capital I've spent
just to get the Russians to the table?

110
00:08:00,167 --> 00:08:02,886
If we call this off, they won't come back.

111
00:08:12,404 --> 00:08:13,995
Spenser.

112
00:08:15,843 --> 00:08:18,515
- Spenser!
- What?

113
00:08:18,602 --> 00:08:22,037
- Get out of my bed.
- Yeah.

114
00:08:22,121 --> 00:08:24,998
I had a good time last night, too.

115
00:08:25,081 --> 00:08:27,388
This was a mistake. Get outta here.

116
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:30,357
What do you mean, "a mistake"?
We had a great time.

117
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:33,908
I don't get involved
with people who work for me.

118
00:08:33,998 --> 00:08:38,866
- It's too late for that.
- Don't tell everybody at work about this.

119
00:08:38,957 --> 00:08:41,754
I don't want everyone thinking I'm a slut.

120
00:08:41,836 --> 00:08:45,794
Believe me - no one's ever gonna think that.

121
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:48,388
What's that supposed to mean?

122
00:08:52,793 --> 00:08:57,183
You should lighten up, you know?
You'll live longer.

123
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:02,822
- What are you doing?
- When you quit overanalysing it,

124
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:07,505
I think you're gonna find out
that you and I are pretty good together.

125
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:10,102
So I'm telling you in advance - yes.

126
00:09:10,189 --> 00:09:12,748
Yes what?

127
00:09:12,828 --> 00:09:16,058
I'll let you buy me dinner,
get me drunk, have your way with me.

128
00:09:16,146 --> 00:09:18,580
Any time you want.

129
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:21,623
You know, um, arrogance doesn't turn me on.

130
00:09:21,705 --> 00:09:28,098
I've read that some women respond to it,
but I'm just letting you know I don't.

131
00:09:48,858 --> 00:09:53,055
- What is it?
- President Palmer's been shot.

132
00:09:53,537 --> 00:09:55,731
He's dead.

133
00:09:59,535 --> 00:10:02,844
<i>...first comment since the death
of the former president.</i>

134
00:10:02,934 --> 00:10:06,244
<i>Security is at the highest level
at President Logan's retreat.</i>

135
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:09,006
<i>To repeat what we know up to this point-</i>

136
00:10:09,092 --> 00:10:12,323
<i>President David Palmer
was assassinated in Los Angeles.</i>

137
00:10:12,412 --> 00:10:18,406
<i>The former president was in the penthouse
apartment of his brother, Wayne Palmer,</i>

138
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:23,516
<i>when a single bullet was fired from
another high-rise building across the street.</i>

139
00:10:23,608 --> 00:10:26,680
<i>- President Palmer was...</i>

140
00:10:31,686 --> 00:10:34,678
- Who is it?
It's me, Frank.

141
00:10:39,045 --> 00:10:40,033
Hey.

142
00:10:40,124 --> 00:10:42,683
I saw your truck. I thought you were on today.

143
00:10:42,764 --> 00:10:46,039
Ned didn't need me this morning.

144
00:10:46,123 --> 00:10:49,831
It's so terrible what happened.

145
00:10:52,201 --> 00:10:54,476
Are you OK?

146
00:10:54,561 --> 00:10:56,516
Yeah, I'm fine.

147
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:00,031
- Come on. I'm making breakfast.
- OK.

148
00:11:07,997 --> 00:11:10,635
- Frank's gonna join us.
- Great.

149
00:11:10,716 --> 00:11:12,911
Derek, stop it.

150
00:11:16,715 --> 00:11:19,103
Morning.

151
00:11:19,834 --> 00:11:22,222
Use a glass, please.

152
00:11:24,072 --> 00:11:25,869
Here.

153
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:37,100
Excuse me.

154
00:11:38,629 --> 00:11:41,586
- Can I ask you something, Frank?
- Yeah, sure.

155
00:11:41,668 --> 00:11:45,580
That rig in Alaska you worked on.
What was that called again?

156
00:11:45,667 --> 00:11:47,817
The Albatross.

157
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:50,295
And you were there last year?

158
00:11:51,265 --> 00:11:53,415
- Yeah. Why?
- That's funny.

159
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:58,782
My friend's brother has worked on that rig for
five years. He's never heard of Frank Flynn.

160
00:11:59,903 --> 00:12:04,771
- It's a big platform.
- He says everyone knows everyone.

161
00:12:04,862 --> 00:12:08,649
- What is this? An interrogation?
- I just don't like being lied to.

162
00:12:08,741 --> 00:12:11,618
- Derek.
- It's all right.

163
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:16,570
- No one's lying to you, Derek.
- Really?

164
00:12:16,659 --> 00:12:21,049
- A lot of the guys just use nicknames.
- Yeah.

165
00:12:21,137 --> 00:12:24,573
What's your friend's brother's name?

166
00:12:26,976 --> 00:12:30,650
- Eat your breakfast.
- I'm not hungry.

167
00:12:38,453 --> 00:12:42,365
Sorry. He's just kind of protective of me.

168
00:12:42,452 --> 00:12:47,240
It's the best thing in the world for him
to have a man around here.

169
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:51,164
- What he said about me and Alaska...
- You don't owe me an explanation.

170
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:55,685
I figure if you had wanted to tell me about
your past you would have told me already.

171
00:12:55,769 --> 00:12:58,406
I trust my instincts.

172
00:12:58,488 --> 00:13:00,876
And I trust you.

173
00:13:02,327 --> 00:13:05,920
<i>Former president David Palmer
was killed just a short while ago.</i>

174
00:13:06,006 --> 00:13:08,360
<i>No information has been released,</i>

175
00:13:08,445 --> 00:13:12,642
<i>but an independent source has verified
that Palmer was in Los Angeles</i>

176
00:13:12,724 --> 00:13:14,441
<i>visiting his brother...</i>

177
00:13:14,523 --> 00:13:19,313
- Bill will call if he needs us, you know that.
- No, he won't.

178
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,314
Come on. It's not our job.

179
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,349
- Not any more.
- This is different.

180
00:13:29,439 --> 00:13:32,669
Come on, Michelle.
I'm just as upset as you are.

181
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:35,795
But there are other people at CTU
can handle this.

182
00:13:35,877 --> 00:13:39,391
No one who was active
during the other attempts on his life.

183
00:13:39,477 --> 00:13:43,105
Tony, you and I worked up suspect profiles.
We ran scenarios.

184
00:13:43,196 --> 00:13:48,143
- And they have our records on file.
- They don't have our experience.

185
00:13:49,634 --> 00:13:53,592
I never once regretted our decision
to leave CTU.

186
00:13:53,673 --> 00:13:58,109
But I don't want to look back on today
and realise I could have helped.

187
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:08,659
We're running a business here. Rick Rosen's
expecting our presentation in an hour.

188
00:14:08,749 --> 00:14:11,262
You can handle the meeting on your own.

189
00:14:11,349 --> 00:14:12,986
Michelle.

190
00:14:13,068 --> 00:14:15,297
Don't do this.

191
00:14:35,702 --> 00:14:39,330
<i>- It's Rick. Leave me a message.
- Rick, it's Tony Almeida.</i>

192
00:14:39,421 --> 00:14:42,856
I wanted to let you know
that Michelle can't make our meeting.

193
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:45,328
She had to go someplace.

194
00:14:46,779 --> 00:14:50,737
On second thought, I'm going with her.

195
00:15:01,255 --> 00:15:03,051
Michelle!

196
00:15:04,294 --> 00:15:06,091
Michelle!

197
00:15:33,366 --> 00:15:37,153
- Did Jepson brief you?
- A car bombing. Two former agents were hit.

198
00:15:37,245 --> 00:15:41,124
Their names were Michelle Dessler
and Tony Almeida.

199
00:15:41,204 --> 00:15:44,241
- You knew them?
- Yeah.

200
00:15:44,324 --> 00:15:47,076
We're looking for a connection
between them and Palmer.

201
00:15:47,163 --> 00:15:51,838
- I sent the parameters to your screen.
- I'll get on it.

202
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,316
<i>- Yeah?
- Are you coming in?</i>

203
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:03,993
I just got paged on a level-five protocol.
Of course I'm coming in.

204
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:07,036
<i>- I wanted to give you a heads-up.
- "Heads-up"?</i>

205
00:16:07,677 --> 00:16:11,875
- It's bad, Chloe.
- President Palmer was gunned down.

206
00:16:11,956 --> 00:16:16,073
<i>- It's not just him.
- What are you talking about?</i>

207
00:16:16,155 --> 00:16:20,193
Someone planted a bomb
in Michelle Dessler's car.

208
00:16:20,274 --> 00:16:22,628
<i>- What?
- Michelle's dead.</i>

209
00:16:22,714 --> 00:16:24,907
Tony's not doing too good.

210
00:16:24,993 --> 00:16:28,029
Doesn't make any sense. They were retired.

211
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:30,068
<i>Buchanan thinks it's linked to Palmer.</i>

212
00:16:30,151 --> 00:16:34,985
<i>We're cross-referencing Palmer with Tony
and Michelle, see if we can find a connection.</i>

213
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:38,142
<i>Anything they may have had in common.</i>

214
00:16:39,709 --> 00:16:41,505
<i>Chloe.</i>

215
00:16:41,588 --> 00:16:43,340
Go.

216
00:16:44,348 --> 00:16:45,747
- Chloe.
- I'll call you back.

217
00:16:45,827 --> 00:16:46,896
<i>- Why?
- Call you back!</i>

218
00:16:46,987 --> 00:16:48,818
Chloe.

219
00:17:05,782 --> 00:17:07,851
Hey!

220
00:17:25,897 --> 00:17:27,409
Hey!

221
00:17:40,932 --> 00:17:43,730
Since I don't have work,
I can take care of the fence.

222
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:48,122
That'd be great. I can't thank you enough
for all the work you've done around here.

223
00:17:48,211 --> 00:17:50,246
Least I could do.

224
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:53,366
Excuse me. Yeah.

225
00:17:53,449 --> 00:17:58,237
Jack, I know this isn't protocol.
Please don't hang up on me. I need your help.

226
00:17:58,328 --> 00:18:00,284
Hold on. I can barely hear you.

227
00:18:00,367 --> 00:18:03,564
I don't have a very good signal. Excuse me.

228
00:18:10,565 --> 00:18:13,124
- What?
- They got Tony and Michelle. She's dead.

229
00:18:13,204 --> 00:18:15,354
Tony's critical. They're gonna kill me.

230
00:18:15,444 --> 00:18:18,081
- What?
- There's four people know you're alive.

231
00:18:18,163 --> 00:18:23,189
Three are down. I'm the only one left. This has
to be about you. It's all we have in common.

232
00:18:23,281 --> 00:18:26,556
- What happened to Tony and Michelle?
- There was a car bomb.

233
00:18:27,081 --> 00:18:29,877
There was a guy outside my apartment.
He was chasing me.

234
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,268
Oh, my God. Where is he now?

235
00:18:32,359 --> 00:18:36,749
I think I lost him. I'm at a payphone, I dumped
my cellphone. I don't know what to do.

236
00:18:37,518 --> 00:18:41,191
Chloe, you need to go dark.
That means zero contact with anyone.

237
00:18:41,276 --> 00:18:42,914
- Even CTU?
- Especially CTU.

238
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:46,067
Whoever's behind this
is probably monitoring them.

239
00:18:46,156 --> 00:18:48,349
Someone knows I'm still alive.

240
00:18:48,435 --> 00:18:51,312
- Who?
- That's what we need to find out.

241
00:18:51,393 --> 00:18:53,429
Head north out of Los Angeles.

242
00:18:53,513 --> 00:18:57,027
There's an abandoned oil refinery
at Variel and Topanga.

243
00:18:57,552 --> 00:19:02,306
Wait for me there. Take cover by the large
storage tanks at the north end of the field.

244
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,461
- You're coming to LA?
- Half an hour.

245
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:06,540
OK. Thanks.

246
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:28,744
Tony Almeida is being medevacked in. I have
a trauma team standing by to receive him.

247
00:19:28,823 --> 00:19:33,737
- You're bringing him to CTU?
- We can't protect him in a hospital.

248
00:19:33,823 --> 00:19:38,019
Michelle and Tony have been inactive
for over a year. Who would want them dead?

249
00:19:38,102 --> 00:19:41,491
- Whoever wanted Palmer dead.
- We're assuming they're connected.

250
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:44,969
The timing was too close
to write it off as a coincidence.

251
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:48,016
There is a connection. Let's find it.

252
00:19:48,099 --> 00:19:52,887
Sir. The DOD liaison is here. I need to
set her up with the protocols for the summit.

253
00:19:52,977 --> 00:19:57,766
I'll take care of it. You have your assignments.
Send updates directly to my screen.

254
00:19:57,856 --> 00:20:01,450
- Where is she?
- She just cleared security.

255
00:20:16,252 --> 00:20:18,811
- Audrey.
- Bill.

256
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:23,880
- It must be hard for you to be back here.
- Thank you, Bill. I'm fine.

257
00:20:23,969 --> 00:20:26,687
I'm sorry about Michelle.

258
00:20:28,808 --> 00:20:32,959
Cummings briefed me. He said you wanted
to postpone the signing of the treaty.

259
00:20:33,047 --> 00:20:35,241
President Logan is making a mistake.

260
00:20:35,326 --> 00:20:37,840
- I don't disagree.
- Have you let him know that?

261
00:20:37,925 --> 00:20:42,714
- He's the president, Bill. It's his call.
- That's what I'm afraid of.

262
00:20:42,804 --> 00:20:48,593
He wants me to make sure that your
top priority is still security for the summit.

263
00:20:48,683 --> 00:20:52,960
Station five is set up for you.
We'll go over the revised security protocol.

264
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:55,236
Great. Thank you, Bill.

265
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:02,557
David Palmer was a man of truth,
and of honour.

266
00:21:02,639 --> 00:21:06,187
And his influence will be felt
for generations to come.

267
00:21:06,278 --> 00:21:08,791
Our nation grieves for its loss.

268
00:21:08,877 --> 00:21:12,073
Martha and I offer our deepest sympathy.

269
00:21:15,915 --> 00:21:18,508
You look beautiful, Mrs. Logan.

270
00:21:22,194 --> 00:21:24,991
I look like a wedding cake.

271
00:21:30,311 --> 00:21:32,506
Let's start over.

272
00:21:37,749 --> 00:21:39,979
Oh, you can get that.

273
00:21:51,626 --> 00:21:54,583
- Is Mrs. Logan ready?
- Not quite.

274
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:57,983
- You didn't tell her about David Palmer?
- No.

275
00:21:58,064 --> 00:22:03,296
Thank you. She'll take it hard when she finds
out. They've been friends for a long time.

276
00:22:03,383 --> 00:22:06,135
You don't have to talk about me
like I'm not here.

277
00:22:06,222 --> 00:22:08,416
Excuse us, Evelyn.

278
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:19,488
- Martha.
- Oh.

279
00:22:19,578 --> 00:22:25,254
Walt, I'm sorry. I know I'm late.
I'm sorry. I'm just having a bad hair day.

280
00:22:25,337 --> 00:22:28,726
Martha. I've got some very bad news.

281
00:22:29,975 --> 00:22:31,533
It...

282
00:22:31,615 --> 00:22:35,050
- It's not Charles, is it?
- No. No, he's fine.

283
00:22:35,135 --> 00:22:37,853
He wanted to tell you himself.

284
00:22:37,933 --> 00:22:40,572
Wh... what?

285
00:22:40,652 --> 00:22:42,883
Walt. Walt.

286
00:22:42,973 --> 00:22:46,089
What... what is it?

287
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:52,682
David Palmer was assassinated.

288
00:22:54,529 --> 00:22:56,201
No.

289
00:23:04,207 --> 00:23:06,561
I'm sorry.

290
00:23:10,125 --> 00:23:13,480
- I know how close you were.
- When did this happen?

291
00:23:13,564 --> 00:23:16,839
- Less than an hour ago.
- This morning?

292
00:23:17,843 --> 00:23:19,959
- Yes.
- I...

293
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:30,469
I... I have to talk to Charles.

294
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:33,834
He's doing damage control.
Keeping this off the front page.

295
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:38,036
- No. I have to talk to him now. No!
- He's doing a press conference. Martha!

296
00:23:38,117 --> 00:23:39,914
Martha!

297
00:23:40,996 --> 00:23:46,991
Agent North. Call John. Tell him
not to let Mrs. Logan anywhere near the stage.

298
00:23:47,075 --> 00:23:48,144
Yeah.

299
00:23:48,235 --> 00:23:51,113
As I look back
upon the deeds of David Palmer -

300
00:23:51,194 --> 00:23:55,505
not only one of this country's great leaders,
but one of this world's great men...

301
00:24:01,551 --> 00:24:05,384
- Mrs. Logan.
- Let go of me. Let go of me. Let go!

302
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:08,348
...President Palmer's entire family.

303
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:12,901
To them, I also pledge
the full resources of this great nation

304
00:24:12,988 --> 00:24:16,821
to find and to punish those responsible.

305
00:24:19,507 --> 00:24:21,974
- I can't let you go out there.
- Don't touch me.

306
00:24:22,066 --> 00:24:25,944
Get away from me, or I will have your family
eating dog food out of a can.

307
00:24:26,025 --> 00:24:29,175
- Martha, stop.
- Mike, dammit, I am the first lady.

308
00:24:29,264 --> 00:24:32,096
Tell your stormtrooper to stay away from me.

309
00:24:33,223 --> 00:24:38,932
- I need to talk to my husband.
- He's in the middle of a press conference.

310
00:24:39,021 --> 00:24:43,617
Hundreds of millions of people
are watching him, live.

311
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:48,092
What is it, Martha? What is so urgent?

312
00:24:50,339 --> 00:24:53,410
I mean, maybe I can help.

313
00:24:53,498 --> 00:24:56,455
Yuri Suvarov and I will sign a treaty

314
00:24:56,537 --> 00:25:02,690
that promises a new level of cooperation
between us and our Russian friends.

315
00:25:03,814 --> 00:25:06,612
Tell Charles I want to see him
when he's done.

316
00:25:06,694 --> 00:25:08,684
All right.

317
00:26:06,118 --> 00:26:08,631
- Don't shoot me.
- What are you doing here?

318
00:26:08,717 --> 00:26:14,427
I'm sorry I followed you.
I'm just... I'm just worried about my mother.

319
00:26:14,516 --> 00:26:17,951
Get up. Get up. Get up!

320
00:26:18,035 --> 00:26:20,867
Dammit! Come here. You're going with me.

321
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:23,946
This is none of my business.
I won't tell anyone.

322
00:26:24,033 --> 00:26:26,945
Just let me go, OK?

323
00:26:27,033 --> 00:26:31,707
I really wish I could, kid, but I can't.
You're going with me. Get in the helicopter.

324
00:26:31,791 --> 00:26:34,543
Frank. Frank. Come on, please.

325
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:37,587
- Please.
- Move.

326
00:26:50,506 --> 00:26:53,542
Prep a sterile cranial field.
I need access to the right hemisphere.

327
00:26:53,626 --> 00:26:56,218
Right away.

328
00:26:56,305 --> 00:26:58,977
- I'll prep the area.
All right.

329
00:26:59,064 --> 00:27:02,499
- I need to talk to Tony.
- He's nonresponsive.

330
00:27:02,583 --> 00:27:07,133
According to the paramedic on the chopper,
a head trauma has affected his speech.

331
00:27:07,221 --> 00:27:10,770
- They're trying to relieve the pressure.
- Will he be able to talk then?

332
00:27:10,861 --> 00:27:15,934
The doctor doesn't know.
I want real-time updates on his progress.

333
00:27:16,019 --> 00:27:19,216
- We need Tony to explain this.
- What is it?

334
00:27:19,298 --> 00:27:22,654
- A connection between Tony and Palmer.
- Tony's phone records?

335
00:27:22,737 --> 00:27:29,084
The last time Tony spoke to President Palmer
was the day that Jack Bauer was killed.

336
00:27:29,176 --> 00:27:34,328
- Did you pull the transcripts?
- I tried, but the files were corrupted.

337
00:27:34,415 --> 00:27:38,692
- What's he hiding?
- Something about Jack's death.

338
00:27:41,253 --> 00:27:44,210
- Are you kidnapping me?
- No.

339
00:27:44,292 --> 00:27:46,885
- Then where are you taking me?
- Los Angeles.

340
00:27:46,972 --> 00:27:48,290
Why?

341
00:27:48,371 --> 00:27:52,045
I couldn't leave you back there.
You'd have gone to the police.

342
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:54,769
What is this about? Who are you?

343
00:27:55,529 --> 00:27:58,247
Someone who's not supposed to still be alive.

344
00:27:58,329 --> 00:28:03,117
- Like some kind of witness relocation thing?
- Yeah, something like that.

345
00:28:03,207 --> 00:28:05,242
- So you were a criminal?
- No.

346
00:28:05,327 --> 00:28:08,761
Listen, Derek.
The less you know about me, the better.

347
00:28:08,845 --> 00:28:11,598
So what are you gonna do with me?

348
00:28:14,044 --> 00:28:15,602
<i>- Hello.
- Diane, it's me.</i>

349
00:28:15,684 --> 00:28:17,992
I can barely hear you. What's that noise?

350
00:28:18,083 --> 00:28:20,721
- I'm in a helicopter with Derek.
- Derek?

351
00:28:20,802 --> 00:28:24,477
He's fine. Listen, I need you
to pick him up in Los Angeles for me.

352
00:28:24,561 --> 00:28:27,473
- Why is he with you?
- I'll explain when I see you.

353
00:28:27,561 --> 00:28:29,755
Frank, what are you doing with Derek?

354
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:33,514
Please do this. I need you to get in the car
and start driving now.

355
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:37,715
- You're scaring me.
- Do you remember you said you trusted me?

356
00:28:37,798 --> 00:28:42,392
<i>Right now I need you to trust me.
Derek's gonna be fine. Just do what I say.</i>

357
00:28:42,477 --> 00:28:45,149
I need you to start driving
towards Los Angeles.

358
00:28:45,236 --> 00:28:49,068
Don't talk to anybody about this.
I'll get back to you as soon as I can.

359
00:28:49,155 --> 00:28:50,951
Frank!

360
00:28:53,953 --> 00:28:59,584
I don't understand. I thought you
were worried about me going to the police.

361
00:28:59,672 --> 00:29:05,462
I have something to do in Los Angeles.
Once it's done, it doesn't matter.

362
00:29:20,706 --> 00:29:25,859
- How are you doing?
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make a scene.

363
00:29:25,945 --> 00:29:28,095
I know that.

364
00:29:29,024 --> 00:29:31,982
Dr Hill says
you haven't been taking your medication.

365
00:29:32,063 --> 00:29:34,292
I don't like the way the pills make me feel.

366
00:29:34,383 --> 00:29:36,373
Marty.

367
00:29:37,622 --> 00:29:40,931
- We just need to get through today.
- Charles,

368
00:29:41,461 --> 00:29:44,577
the reason that I needed to...
needed to talk to you...

369
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:47,457
What is it, honey? Go ahead.

370
00:29:47,939 --> 00:29:53,934
I think that David was killed because of
something he was about to tell me.

371
00:29:55,657 --> 00:29:57,852
Come over here.

372
00:29:59,176 --> 00:30:02,372
- What are you talking about?
- He called me yesterday.

373
00:30:02,456 --> 00:30:05,686
- He said he wanted to meet with me.
- Meet with you about what?

374
00:30:05,774 --> 00:30:09,561
He said that it concerned national security
and that it involved you.

375
00:30:09,653 --> 00:30:12,042
- Me?
- Yes.

376
00:30:12,133 --> 00:30:16,727
- What else did he say?
- Just that he would explain when he saw me.

377
00:30:16,812 --> 00:30:21,565
If this was so important,
why wouldn't he have called me himself?

378
00:30:21,651 --> 00:30:26,848
Charles, you shut him out of this White
House about 18 months ago, you know that.

379
00:30:26,929 --> 00:30:29,078
He had no real access.

380
00:30:30,008 --> 00:30:32,397
Except through you.

381
00:30:32,488 --> 00:30:34,796
- You don't believe me.
- I didn't say that.

382
00:30:34,887 --> 00:30:37,275
You didn't need to.

383
00:30:37,366 --> 00:30:38,481
Martha.

384
00:30:38,565 --> 00:30:41,125
I am not making this up.

385
00:30:41,205 --> 00:30:46,038
- I am not crazy. I am not a fool, Charles.
- Martha, it's gonna be all right.

386
00:30:46,124 --> 00:30:50,514
I am not making this up.

387
00:30:53,522 --> 00:30:57,877
- All right. I'll have Walt look into it.
- You will?

388
00:30:57,961 --> 00:31:00,712
- Yes.
- Thank you.

389
00:31:01,479 --> 00:31:03,470
But right now,

390
00:31:03,559 --> 00:31:09,996
President Suvarov and his wife are arriving
in one hour. I need you to be there.

391
00:31:10,077 --> 00:31:12,670
I need you by my side.

392
00:31:14,116 --> 00:31:15,549
Yes.

393
00:31:15,636 --> 00:31:18,275
- Come here.
- I'm sorry.

394
00:31:35,111 --> 00:31:37,749
- Is she all right?
- No, she's not all right.

395
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:40,583
She's having another one of her delusions.

396
00:31:40,669 --> 00:31:44,058
She thinks David Palmer
was about to tell her something.

397
00:31:44,148 --> 00:31:48,663
She's imagining she's in the middle
of one of her own conspiracy theories.

398
00:31:48,747 --> 00:31:50,941
What should we do?

399
00:31:53,346 --> 00:31:55,336
Nothing.

400
00:32:11,701 --> 00:32:15,579
- Have you talked to Chloe this morning?
- No. Why?

401
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:18,220
She left her apartment about a half-hour ago.

402
00:32:18,299 --> 00:32:20,733
- She should have been here.
- Probably traffic.

403
00:32:20,819 --> 00:32:24,253
She commutes against traffic.
She's not answering her cellphone.

404
00:32:24,338 --> 00:32:28,534
- I wouldn't worry about it.
- She sounded strange when I talked to her.

405
00:32:28,617 --> 00:32:30,686
She always sounds strange.

406
00:32:30,776 --> 00:32:33,335
I'll call Adamson, have him locate her cell.

407
00:32:33,415 --> 00:32:37,248
- Don't waste his time. She's fine. I'm sure.
- What makes you so sure?

408
00:32:37,334 --> 00:32:39,529
- It doesn't matter.
- It does to me.

409
00:32:39,613 --> 00:32:43,241
I saw her. OK? Uh, about half an hour ago.

410
00:32:43,332 --> 00:32:46,290
- I thought you said...
- Forget what I said.

411
00:32:47,252 --> 00:32:52,643
- Where did you see her?
- Man. Do you really need me to spell it out?

412
00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:57,166
Don't worry about Chloe. She's fine. All right?

413
00:33:05,087 --> 00:33:07,077
Can you just let me out here?

414
00:33:07,167 --> 00:33:10,919
- There's nothing here.
- Just pull over, please.

415
00:33:19,563 --> 00:33:21,951
Why won't you talk to me, Frank?

416
00:33:22,922 --> 00:33:25,958
Can you please tell me what's going on?

417
00:33:28,961 --> 00:33:30,757
Please?

418
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:35,868
A friend of mine's in trouble.
I needed to pick her up in a hurry.

419
00:33:35,959 --> 00:33:39,996
This is the only way
I could get to her quick enough.

420
00:34:23,106 --> 00:34:25,573
- Chloe.
- Jack.

421
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:30,340
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine. What's happening?

422
00:34:30,424 --> 00:34:34,496
- Why would anyone want to kill us?
- I don't know, but we're gonna find out.

423
00:34:34,583 --> 00:34:39,098
I need to get access to CTU's archives from
a secure location. Can you help me do that?

424
00:34:39,182 --> 00:34:44,335
I can't do it from my laptop. There's
a research loft at Caltech. I can get us in.

425
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,891
Who's that?

426
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:52,416
- I'll explain as soon as we're in the car.
- I don't have a car. I took a cab.

427
00:34:53,378 --> 00:34:58,405
Come on. Get in the helicopter. We gotta go.
Derek, get back in.

428
00:35:12,973 --> 00:35:14,201
- Jack.
- What?

429
00:35:14,292 --> 00:35:16,760
It's them. How did they find me?

430
00:35:16,852 --> 00:35:19,888
I don't think they ever lost you.

431
00:35:25,129 --> 00:35:28,485
- Come on.
- What's going on, Frank? Who are they?

432
00:35:28,568 --> 00:35:32,526
- What are we waiting for? Take off!
- We're not at speed.

433
00:35:33,727 --> 00:35:39,517
We're not gonna make it. Get out. Get out
now, and stay by the side of the helicopter!

434
00:35:56,641 --> 00:36:01,555
Here! Take him and go into the refinery.
Find somewhere to hide. Move!

435
00:36:17,316 --> 00:36:19,385
I can't see a thing.

436
00:36:19,475 --> 00:36:24,753
Double back. Cut him off. Go through
the smoke and get him. I'm going around.

437
00:36:52,307 --> 00:36:54,297
Go over here.

438
00:37:55,889 --> 00:37:58,562
Hold your fire, Chloe!

439
00:38:09,926 --> 00:38:13,634
- What are you doing? Let's get outta here.
- Take Derek and walk away.

440
00:38:13,725 --> 00:38:16,158
Walk away now!

441
00:38:27,441 --> 00:38:30,910
You're not gonna make it
unless you get medical attention.

442
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:35,470
You tell me what I want to know, and I'll
get you to a hospital. You understand me?

443
00:38:35,559 --> 00:38:37,993
- Do you understand me?
- Yeah.

444
00:38:38,078 --> 00:38:42,707
Four people knew I was alive.
This morning you tried to take 'em out. Why?

445
00:38:42,797 --> 00:38:47,391
Palmer was the primary... primary target.
They only cared about Palmer.

446
00:38:47,476 --> 00:38:51,548
The others were just a diversion
to set you up.

447
00:38:51,635 --> 00:38:55,865
- Make it look like you did it.
- Why did they want to kill Palmer?

448
00:38:55,953 --> 00:38:59,150
To keep him from talking.
They had to shut him up.

449
00:38:59,232 --> 00:39:04,067
- What did he know?
- I wasn't given that information.

450
00:39:04,151 --> 00:39:07,905
I was only hired to take out the principal.

451
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:13,423
You're the one that killed Palmer.

452
00:39:13,509 --> 00:39:16,068
Yeah. Oh, God.

453
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:36,173
Who's behind this?

454
00:39:36,263 --> 00:39:39,060
I got my orders through a closed site.

455
00:39:39,142 --> 00:39:41,860
We never use names, you know that.

456
00:39:41,942 --> 00:39:44,614
That's all I know. Take me to a hospital.

457
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:47,690
Yeah.
