1
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,596
<i> This is Air Force One,</i>
<i>declaring an emergency. </i>

2
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,069
<i>We're not gonna make it. </i>
<i>I have to put it down. </i>

3
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,991
Chloe, what's happening?

4
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,674
- <i> Air Force One, you copy?</i>
Chloe?

5
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,716
<i> Air Force One is down. </i>

6
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:30,075
<i> This may be him. </i>

7
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,276
<i>It's the president. </i>

8
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,274
<i>He's still alive. I repeat, the president is alive. </i>

9
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,033
Marwan has to be in a 50 mile radius...

10
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,714
- There's a higher priority than Marwan.
- What?

11
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,554
- Recovering the nuclear football.
Didn't it go with Air Force One?

12
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,871
The missile inflicted enough damage
that it left debris.

13
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,394
A lot was sucked out,
including the football.

14
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,519
That case contains the codes and locations
of our entire nuclear arsenal.

15
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,195
- What's the location of the football?
- 40 miles northeast of here, in the desert.

16
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:09,033
Air Support, the football is in the lead Jeep,
headed north. Take it out.

17
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:19,111
<i> I've got the football. </i>
<i>Three hostiles down, one escaped. </i>

18
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,158
<i>I'm not positive, but I think it was Marwan. </i>

19
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,550
There are pages missing.
Tell me the contents of the pages.

20
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:29,428
It's the section which contains
warhead locations and activation codes.

21
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,398
If they get ahold
of a warhead and a matching code,

22
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,436
we will not be able to stop them.

23
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:39,071
Mr Vice President, President Keeler is alive,
but he's in critical condition.

24
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:43,597
<i>Sir, I recommend you invoke the 25th</i>
<i>Amendment and take control of things. </i>

25
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,913
- You're worried about him.
- I am. He seems unsure of himself.

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,232
I solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute
the office of the president.

27
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:58,314
Preserve, protect and defend
the constitution of the United States.

28
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:02,518
Mr President.
I've just received a phone call from CTU.

29
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:07,720
Part of the nuclear football
has fallen into the hands of terrorists.

30
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,438
Vice President Logan has been sworn in.
He is now President of the United States.

31
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,512
His office called.
They want an update in 15 minutes.

32
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:27,354
We're working on several protocols.
What is he gonna want to focus on?

33
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,557
How a Stealth fighter was stolen
from one of our air bases.

34
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,474
More to the point, how it took down
Air Force One with one of our missiles.

35
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,996
- Is he briefed on Marwan?
He knows he's behind today,

36
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,959
but he's gonna want specifics on the football.
Where are we on that?

37
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,031
Jack's at the debris field.

38
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:48,193
- He's trying to reconstruct the stolen chapter.
- How?

39
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,999
He's working with Fred Laughton
from the DOD.

40
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:54,117
- He wrote it, he'll know what's missing.
Good.

41
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:58,591
- Who's going to run point on this update?
- You and Tony.

42
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,990
All right, we don't have a lot of time,
so fast-track this.

43
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,277
Double source all intel
through Homeland Security and CIA.

44
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,830
Skip the usual request procedures.
Tie in to their data directly.

45
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,150
- Yes?
- <i> I've got Bauer on the line. </i>

46
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,515
Put him through.

47
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,034
<i> Go ahead. </i>

48
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,829
- Are you still in briefing?
- <i>Yes, on speaker. What have you found?</i>

49
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:22,708
Laughton and I finished a reconstruction.
We're getting that to you.

50
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,951
Jack, it's Bill Buchanan.
Summarise our exposure.

51
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,918
What information does Marwan
have in his possession?

52
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,074
The location of our domestic nuclear arsenal.
The inventory's in the thousands.

53
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:37,357
Many weapons are in transit
as part of standard operations.

54
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,510
Why can't DOD secure these weapons?

55
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:43,878
A number are between checkpoints. It'd take
over an hour to account for all of them.

56
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,758
Listen, we've gotta remember,
Marwan only needs one.

57
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,671
All right. We'll get on this.

58
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:52,150
<i>Get back here as soon as you can</i>
<i>and help Audrey liaise with DOD.</i>

59
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,708
We need to account for every single weapon.

60
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,519
I'm on my way.

61
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,394
The coordinates for the third one are:

62
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,631
Latitude 37 degrees, 14 minutes,

63
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,756
longitude, 115 degrees,

64
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,638
21 minutes.

65
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,998
There it is. Jefferson City, Iowa.

66
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:22,234
- When is the warhead due to arrive?
- 7am local time. Five hours from now.

67
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,632
That puts it somewhere 200 miles east.
It's still in Illinois.

68
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,918
We can intercept it anywhere
from this point to here.

69
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,432
All right. Let's put our people in place.

70
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:44,591
Warheads in transit because of shift-and-hide
operations pose the biggest problem.

71
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:49,913
We can verify military traffic in coastal areas
from here. Find what DOD has in the Midwest.

72
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,030
Yeah, that's already underway. Audrey
said she should have it in a few minutes.

73
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,634
Look, Tony...

74
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,558
- Am I interrupting something?
- No, Chloe. What is it?

75
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,437
- Are you logged on?
- Yeah.

76
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:10,799
Look. 15 minutes ago, the credit card of Eric
Murphy was used at Western Gas in Torrance.

77
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,633
- Who's Eric Murphy?
- His real name is Yosik Khatami.

78
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,518
- He's affiliated with Marwan.
- How do we know that?

79
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,718
Our watch list. We put out a net asking
for anybody connected to Habib Marwan.

80
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,872
- We didn't expect any hits so soon.
- Why was he so careless?

81
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,155
Maybe he wasn't. Maybe it's a decoy.

82
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,119
It wouldn't be much of a decoy
because we don't know where he is.

83
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:33,636
- This was a mistake.
- Did the gas station have a camera?

84
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:37,190
- Yes. He's driving a Lexus.
Are we on the satellite?

85
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:42,559
Yes, we're monitoring them now.
If this guy's still on the road, we'll find him.

86
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:46,872
- Who do we have in the area to run point?
- Curtis left Division. He's headed here.

87
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,520
Divert him. Have Field Ops meet him there.

88
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,591
All right.

89
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,958
- <i>Audrey. </i>
- It's me.

90
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:03,511
- Hey. Are you on your way back here?
- Yeah. How much weaponry's accounted for?

91
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,309
72 per cent. We have problems
getting confirmations from the Midwest.

92
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,675
- Why?
- There were convoys shipping weapons

93
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,718
to be dismantled
under the arms reduction treaty.

94
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,553
A lot were rerouted
after the bombing this morning.

95
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:19,792
Use local channels. Weapon transports
check in with regional substations.

96
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,872
- Just call them directly.
- All right. I'll do that.

97
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,473
How are you holding up?

98
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,232
I'm OK.

99
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:31,471
What have the doctors told you about Paul?

100
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,197
They're having a hard time
keeping him stable.

101
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,636
Just hang in there. He'll fight through it.

102
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,631
Yeah.

103
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:48,192
- Tell Michelle I'll be there in 20 minutes.
- All right, will do. Bye.

104
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,595
- Yes?
- Marwan, it's... it's me.

105
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,830
- Is everything all right?
- <i>No. </i>

106
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,751
No, it's not. I...

107
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,035
I made a stupid mistake.

108
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,032
- They're gonna find me.
- What happened?

109
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:21,274
I stopped to get gas. While I was driving
away, I realised I used the wrong credit card -

110
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,079
the one with the name Murphy.
The one you gave me.

111
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,151
I told you to get rid of that one.

112
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,472
I was in a hurry, Habib. I had to make
arrangements for delivery of the warhead.

113
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,393
When that gets flagged,
they'll search the highways.

114
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,472
- I know. I'm not on the highway any more.
- Where are you?

115
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,552
Inglewood. I'm on my way to Prado's now.

116
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:43,349
You're closer to the marina.
Go straight there, I'll have him meet you.

117
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,069
<i>Prado will help you get out of the country. </i>

118
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:50,038
Thank you, Habib. Thank you.

119
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:59,155
Mr President, it may be precipitous
moving to the bunker now.

120
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,231
Working from the Oval Office

121
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:05,871
might exhibit a greater sense of confidence
in our abilities to handle this crisis.

122
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:09,350
The purpose of the bunker
is to protect the president, is it not?

123
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,318
- Yes, sir.
- Well...

124
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,791
I feel it is always wiser
to take the prudent course.

125
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,199
Will I be able to function at 100 per cent here?

126
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:58,989
- Absolutely, Mr President.
- What protection does this bunker afford?

127
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,798
Total.

128
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,189
You're 200 feet below the surface.

129
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:06,750
If the White House suffers a direct hit,
everyone would be safe,

130
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:10,355
as would communication infrastructure
to the rest of the country.

131
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,238
Let's hope that's not needed.

132
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,357
Yes?
- Mr Buchanan is on the line. He's asked...

133
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,479
Mr President,
Bill Buchanan from CTU is on the line.

134
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,194
Hello, Bill. What do you have for me?

135
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:39,955
I'm here with Michelle Dessler,
director of CTU Los Angeles,

136
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,110
and Tony Almeida, heading tactical.

137
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,792
Let's get started.

138
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:48,192
Have all of our armaments
referenced in the red chapter been secured?

139
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:51,670
Not completely, Mr President,
but we're working with DOD on it.

140
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,718
- What else?
- The man who choreographed today's events,

141
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,998
Habib Marwan, is at large. Most likely,
he is in possession of the red chapter.

142
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,674
- What are we doing?
We picked up a thread.

143
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:07,232
<i>We have a location where one of Marwan's</i>
<i>associates was detected 20 minutes ago. </i>

144
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:10,312
That sounds promising. What else?

145
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:15,520
<i> We're sifting through intel, hoping</i>
<i>to put together a pursuit scenario soon. </i>

146
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,151
So you're pretty confident you'll be able
to catch this terrorist, this Habib Marwan,

147
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,119
- before he strikes again?
- <i> It's not an exact science, sir. </i>

148
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,158
<i>All we can do is maximise</i>
<i>the probability for success. </i>

149
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:30,312
- <i>There are no guarantees. </i>
- Of course, I understand that.

150
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,834
We need to get control of the situation.

151
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:40,754
I can't govern from here indefinitely,
but I'm not going until it's safe.

152
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,671
<i> Sir. </i>

153
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:45,877
Their time is better spent
working up what they have.

154
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,952
I recommend we let them get back to it.

155
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,512
OK, Bill.

156
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,398
Call us when you have
something more concrete.

157
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,038
Yes, sir.

158
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:08,550
All right. Let's get back to work.

159
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:13,953
Wait a second. Does anybody else
feel uneasy about what we just heard here?

160
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,473
In what way?

161
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:20,156
Logan's supposed to be the man who speaks
to this country and exudes confidence,

162
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,993
not fear.

163
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,675
Air Force One was just attacked,
Keeler's in critical condition.

164
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:32,309
- Logan was just sworn in. Give him time.
- We don't have time.

165
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:36,234
We've got Khatami, heading toward the coast.
We have him on satellite.

166
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,993
Link this up to Curtis.
I want him running point.

167
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:45,269
Tell Curtis to remain discreet. I wanna know
what Khatami's doing before we take him.

168
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,277
Michelle.

169
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:12,432
I was out of line a couple of hours ago
about you and Bill.

170
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:16,790
It's your life,
and I've got no right to judge you.

171
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:21,113
I appreciate that.

172
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,876
Whatever tension there is between us,
I want to apologise for my part in it.

173
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:29,555
I'd like it if we could just let it go
so we could do our jobs.

174
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:33,189
Leave the past in the past, and move on.

175
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,679
Sounds good.

176
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,553
All right.

177
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,471
- Thank you.
- Yes, sir.

178
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,755
Curtis is about to arrive at the marina.

179
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,912
- Set up a satellite, also an audio link.
- I'll take care of it.

180
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,514
Thanks.
- You want me to run point?

181
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,559
No, Bill and I will do that,
but I want you in on this.

182
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:08,349
- To do what?
- I'd like your tactical input.

183
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:14,276
Fine. I'll have Edgar transfer
everything over to the situation room.

184
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,351
Edgar.

185
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:23,633
I get the feeling Tony's not entirely
comfortable with the configuration today.

186
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:27,110
We haven't seen each other for a long time.
It's uncomfortable.

187
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,716
The difference is you seem to be able
to stay on point. I'm not so sure about him.

188
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:35,031
I am. He'll be fine.

189
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,955
- He's alone.
- What's he doing?

190
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,315
Looks like a meet. He's waiting for someone.

191
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:34,631
- Is the marine unit in place?
- They're behind the jetty.

192
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:50,196
The man he's meeting's just arrived.
He's walking towards him.

193
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,032
- Is it Marwan?
- I can't tell.

194
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,395
Remember, Curtis, we need them both alive.

195
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,436
I copy.

196
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:01,310
All right, teams, I'll close up for the pier.
Keep them contained, but do not shoot to kill.

197
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,870
Repeat, do not shoot to kill.

198
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,071
Dammit! Teams, respond. Who is that?

199
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,879
This is McKellan.
It looks like a private patrol.

200
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,633
All right, hold your positions.

201
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,597
Yosik.

202
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:32,195
Prado. You're late.
I've been standing here waiting for you.

203
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,635
I'm here now. Let's go.

204
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,995
- Come on. What are we waiting for?
- Wait.

205
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:44,277
- What's the matter?
- Someone's here.

206
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,714
It's Miller. U-base is clear.

207
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,475
It's OK. It's just harbour security.

208
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,393
No, something's wrong. They're onto us.

209
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,789
Yosik, now!

210
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,879
The man he's meeting is not Marwan.

211
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,839
- Is anybody else there besides them?
- No, unless someone's on the boat.

212
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,310
Marine units, move into position.

213
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,278
<i>All teams, move in. </i>

214
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:54,078
- We're OK. We should just get out of here.
- There was a police officer there.

215
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:59,393
I told you, that's harbour security.
They stop by all the time.

216
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,394
Who the hell is that?

217
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,833
This is CTU.
We have you completely surrounded.

218
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:23,993
- <i> Yes. Where are you?</i>
- They found us. They're gonna get us.

219
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:28,756
Yosik, you can't let that happen.
You cannot allow yourself to be captured.

220
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,990
I understand.

221
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,958
Also you have to kill Prado.
He knows too much.

222
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,600
I'll do what's necessary.

223
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,834
Yosik! Yosik!

224
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:46,117
Shots fired! Shots fired! Move in.

225
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,670
Come out with your hands up.
You're surrounded. There's no escape.

226
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,228
Coming out!
Drop the gun!

227
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:56,074
Put the gun down!
Step off the boat. Get off the boat.

228
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,152
There's a man inside.
I shot him. He was gonna kill me.

229
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:03,791
He was trying to steal my boat.
It was self-defence.

230
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:07,316
Put your hands on your head.

231
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,879
- Who are you? Who are you?
- Oh, Jesus.

232
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:15,238
My name's Joe Prado.
I'm innocent. I have nothing to hide.

233
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:24,352
Where's Yosik?
- He's dead. His phone was lying next to him.

234
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,476
- Get him out of here.
- Let's go.

235
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,949
- Secure the boat.
Yes, sir.

236
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:33,352
Yosik's dead. We have the man he was
meeting. He says his name is Joe Prado.

237
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,158
- Bring him in.
- Will do.

238
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:38,516
We recovered Yosik's cellphone.
I'll report to you en route.

239
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,876
Good work, Curtis. We're standing by.

240
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,559
Go ahead.

241
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,438
What do you want to do?

242
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,711
Control the situation.

243
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:56,316
Make sure Prado doesn't talk
to the authorities. He can hurt us.

244
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,393
- How do we get to him?
- We can't. Not directly.

245
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,511
- <i> Hello. </i>
- This is Marwan.

246
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:18,149
- <i>Yes, Marwan?</i>
- Can you reach Amnesty Global at this hour?

247
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,073
- <i>What do you need?</i>
- An attorney.

248
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,391
Tell them that an innocent man
is being held without charges

249
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,234
and is about to be tortured
at CTU Los Angeles.

250
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:34,918
<i>By God's grace, President Keeler survived. </i>
<i>But more than 75 others did not. </i>

251
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,073
<i>I share in your grief and anger</i>
<i>over this tragedy. </i>

252
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:42,277
<i>My family and I feel no differently</i>
<i>than every one of you. </i>

253
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,874
<i>We are shocked, saddened,</i>

254
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,235
<i>and maybe a little afraid. </i>

255
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:52,189
<i>These terrorists have displayed once again</i>
<i>their indifference toward human life. </i>

256
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,350
<i>They will pay for what they have done. </i>

257
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:57,477
- Bill, excuse me.
- <i>However, we must endure... </i>

258
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:00,552
- There's a convoy missing.
- What?

259
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,553
It was headed from Illinois to Iowa.
It disappeared inside the border.

260
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,155
Disappeared?
- They were due to call in. They didn't.

261
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,390
I tried on comm sat, there was no reply.

262
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,391
- Satellite?
Nothing.

263
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,712
- What was on the trucks?
- A nuclear warhead.

264
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:23,639
<i>Our faith and our resolve will prevail. </i>

265
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:36,711
<i>... the files I sent. Have Prado's</i>
<i>information for me as soon as I get back. </i>

266
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:40,076
OK, we've got the prints.
I'll run them through our databases.

267
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,752
<i>Thanks. </i>

268
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,876
What do we know about the prisoner?

269
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,996
Just the name he gave - Joe Prado.

270
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,117
Curtis uploaded his prints.
I'm running through them.

271
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,158
Prep Holding
so Curtis can begin interrogation.

272
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,629
I want this man broken in minutes, not hours.

273
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,918
Clear all directories.
Put all resources into finding this warhead.

274
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,309
Mike, I wish I'd known about this sooner too.

275
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,233
Look, I'm not pointing fingers here.
I'm on your side.

276
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,552
But the president is not going to be happy
that his statement can be invalidated.

277
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:13,111
I don't know what to tell you. We're
putting everything into finding this warhead.

278
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,395
All right. Let me get back to you.

279
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,550
Move!

280
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:25,118
Inside. Let's go. Move. Move, move!

281
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,549
Get in, get in.

282
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,713
We have it. We're heading out now.

283
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,231
Sir.

284
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,988
General Thomas told me
we're missing a warhead.

285
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:00,039
- I just heard some details from Buchanan.
- When did this happen?

286
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:06,036
- It disappeared between 1:45am and 2:15.
- And none of our satellites picked this up?

287
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:09,829
It was mountain terrain at night.
People are analysing the imagery,

288
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,878
but it's going to be hard to find.

289
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,190
What will we do if we don't find Marwan?

290
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:21,877
Our people are doing everything to contain
him. It's going to be difficult for him to leave.

291
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:27,193
It's difficult to shoot Air Force One with
our own Stealth fighter, but he managed that.

292
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:31,239
Who knows what they're planning?
I'm sure he's gonna come after me next.

293
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,709
There's no indication that that's his plan.

294
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:39,796
You don't know that. We don't have
enough information to know what his plan is.

295
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:44,872
Head of Secret Service
is on his way over now.

296
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,110
He has a revised plan,

297
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,876
and I'm certain it will ease your mind
about your safety.

298
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:03,870
That's the bastard from the marina,
helping the terrorists.

299
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:06,520
I guess.

300
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,591
Sir, holding room B is ready.

301
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,955
I'd like to get him in a room for a few minutes.

302
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,519
What?

303
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,956
He'd talk to me in about two seconds.

304
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:20,431
Oh, you wanna hurt him to get revenge
for your mother dying. I can understand that.

305
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:25,036
...images processed immediately.
Take him to Holding.

306
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:28,715
- Did Edgar run the prints?
- Name checks out. Joe Prado, ex-marine.

307
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:32,918
No criminal record. But over
the last five years, no record of employment.

308
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,798
- Which means he's a criminal or a mercenary.
- Right.

309
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:39,759
- I'll find out if he knows about the warhead.
- All right.

310
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,354
Tony.
- What have you got?

311
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:45,557
I found the convoy. I just got off
with Iowa Highway Patrol.

312
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:48,712
Military transport was ambushed.
Everyone's dead.

313
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,872
- What about the warhead?
- Gone.

314
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:56,317
Find out what they'd need to transport it.
Tell law enforcement to put up perimeters.

315
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,676
Check airstrips or clearings
where they might put a chopper.

316
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,751
Yeah.

317
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:10,310
Remember he's an ex-marine.
He won't cave easily.

318
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:16,839
I need to establish that even though we're in a
government building, I'll go as far as it takes.

319
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:20,799
- How are you gonna start?
- I'll use Richards.

320
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,117
OK.

321
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,840
I told you I'm not talking to you, pal.

322
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:41,037
I haven't been charged,
I haven't done anything wrong.

323
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,759
I killed in self-defence.
He was stealing my boat.

324
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:48,834
We both know that's a lie. So let's not waste
each other's time. What do you say, Joe?

325
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:53,072
- I'm not saying anything to you.
- Highly unlikely.

326
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,190
What the hell is this?

327
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,311
- Yes?
- <i> Where's Curtis?</i>

328
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,472
- He's just about to start with Prado.
- <i>Tell him to stop. </i>

329
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:22,472
- What?
- <i>That's an order. Come to the floor, now. </i>

330
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:25,950
- It was self-defence. You can't do this.
- <i> Curtis. </i>

331
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:29,510
- What?
- Buchanan wants to see us before you start.

332
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,794
Wait till I get back.

333
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,190
- What's this about?
- I don't know.

334
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:01,319
We have a problem.
This is David Weiss from Amnesty Global.

335
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:06,997
I have a court order protecting the rights
of Joseph Prado whom you have in custody.

336
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:10,868
This US marshal is here to assure
I'm taken to the prisoner immediately.

337
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,110
- Ridiculous.
- That's your opinion.

338
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,875
But Mr Prado's rights will not be violated.
Take me to him now.

339
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,839
- We have no choice, Curtis.
- A warhead's missing. This is our only lead.

340
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:26,950
I'll get into this with the Justice Department.
In the meantime, do what he says.

341
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:48,118
When can I expect his call?
It's extremely important.

342
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:52,318
I understand that, but I need to talk
to the judge. Please have him call me back.

343
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,039
- Mr Buchanan.
- Do you have those hourlies for me?

344
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:58,271
- No, I don't. But I'm here on another matter.
- What?

345
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:01,796
I heard Prado's interrogation is on hold. Why?

346
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,996
You have a job to do.
Please get back to it.

347
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:08,471
I know I'm not supposed to interfere, but
considering what I've been through today -

348
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,949
my mother dying because of these terrorists -

349
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:14,237
I wanna know why we're letting
some lawyer protect Prado.

350
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,993
We're gonna fix it,
but it's gonna take some time.

351
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:20,595
- That's time we don't have.
- Edgar, stop.

352
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,797
I'm trying to cut you some slack,
but get back to your job.

353
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:28,829
You need to put all that other stuff
on hold for a while, please.

354
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,070
Yes, sir.

355
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,879
Buchanan. Yes, I'll hold for the judge.

356
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:41,590
- You're supposed to be doing the hourlies.
- I don't know why everybody's telling me.

357
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,716
I have a photographic memory.

358
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:47,349
How could I forget?
You tell me, like, every other day.

359
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:51,513
I don't like what's happening - some
PC lawyer's holding us up from our job.

360
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:56,469
Your job is to do the hourlies.
You're holding yourself up.

361
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,590
- Chloe.
- Have you heard about the warhead?

362
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:10,478
Yeah. FBI link up
with Iowa Sheriff's Department?

363
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:13,597
- Yes.
- OK, good. Who's questioning the prisoner?

364
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,875
- Prado, the guy Curtis brought in?
- Yeah.

365
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:18,428
- No one.
- What are you talking about?

366
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:22,911
An attorney came in with an order saying
we weren't allowed to be alone with Prado.

367
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,151
Buchanan's on the phone
with the judge who signed the order.

368
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,710
I'll be right back. I don't believe this.

369
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:34,920
I disagree. This does not fall outside
the boundary of the Patriot Act.

370
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,752
- Thanks.
- What's going on?

371
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,957
You've got a key witness.
We should be pressing this guy.

372
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:43,476
Judge Norton won't budge.
We have to take it to an appellate judge.

373
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:47,599
- Does he know what the stakes are?
- He does, but Prado's got no record.

374
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:51,468
What about the fact he was meeting
a terrorist in the middle of the night?

375
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,913
Circumstantial.

376
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,470
We need to interrogate this prisoner.
I don't care about the order.

377
00:28:56,560 --> 00:29:00,439
I agree, but his attorney's with him,
and a marshal protecting his rights.

378
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:04,115
- Where's his attorney?
- Holding, with Prado. Don't make it worse.

379
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,997
I just want to talk to him.

380
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:10,039
- How much longer do I have to stay?
- I'm trying to get you out.

381
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,270
My office is filing a complaint.

382
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:15,113
They have nothing on me.
I was alone on my boat.

383
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,112
I don't even know this man
that they were going after.

384
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,794
Come in with me now.

385
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:30,513
- Who are you?
- Bauer, Department of Defence. And you are?

386
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,716
David Weiss, Amnesty Global.

387
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:38,751
- Why is the suspect not in restraints?
- Amnesty's order supersedes our authority.

388
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:42,037
My client is cooperating.
He's not trying to go anywhere.

389
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,429
He wants to be treated like any US citizen.

390
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:48,354
Your client aided and abetted
the people who attacked the president.

391
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:51,238
- You don't know that.
- As a matter of fact, we do.

392
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,709
Then charge him.

393
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:01,109
May I speak with you privately?

394
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:04,350
Get the door.

395
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:15,429
You and I know your client isn't clean, and
that he conspired to steal a nuclear warhead.

396
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,193
All my client wants is due process.

397
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:22,114
Mr Weiss, these people
are not gonna stop attacking us today

398
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:25,909
until millions and millions
of Americans are dead.

399
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,232
I don't wanna bypass the constitution,
but they're extraordinary circumstances.

400
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:35,269
The constitution was born out of
extraordinary circumstances, Mr Bauer.

401
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:40,514
This plays out by the book.
Not in a back room with a rubber hose.

402
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:45,358
I hope you can live with that.

403
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,390
- Sir, can I help you?
- No, it's all right.

404
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:21,115
- How'd you get here so fast?
What?

405
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:27,709
- Who asked you to represent Mr Prado?
- I don't have to give you that information.

406
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:31,156
From his arrest,
did the suspect have time to call a lawyer?

407
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,231
No.

408
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:41,273
Marwan called Amnesty Global.
This is his play.

409
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:44,830
That means Prado knows something
Marwan doesn't want us to hear.

410
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:50,916
- We still can't get around that court order.
- We need to call the president now.

411
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:56,633
We cannot have leaks
regarding this missing warhead.

412
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,029
I've contacted General Wilson in Iowa.

413
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,749
He's sealing off the roads
while we clean up the ambushed convoy.

414
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:05,673
What about those Highway officers
who discovered it?

415
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:09,070
Wilson's brought them in
and is explaining the situation.

416
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:14,234
The good news is this is happening in the
middle of the night. The country's still asleep.

417
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:16,989
Yes?

418
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:23,315
<i> CTU Los Angeles is on the line</i>
<i>for President Logan. They say it's urgent. </i>

419
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,960
Thank you, gentlemen. That'll be all.

420
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:28,959
Walt.

421
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,031
Stay.

422
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:44,234
Put him through.
- <i> Go ahead. </i>

423
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:48,154
- This is Bill Buchanan. I'm with Jack Bauer.
- <i>Yes. What do you have for me?</i>

424
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:53,030
In the process of trying to track down this
warhead, we've brought in a prime suspect.

425
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,954
- What have you learned?
- Well, that's the problem. Our hands are tied.

426
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,918
Amnesty Global has interceded on his behalf.

427
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,994
- Interceded? On what grounds?
- He's a US citizen with no previous record.

428
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:07,913
- Why is he a suspect?
- <i>We found him with Yosik Khatami,</i>

429
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,991
<i>a man linked to today's events. </i>

430
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:13,197
It doesn't violate any law
to question a suspect.

431
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,840
Mr President, if I may?

432
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:19,195
Go ahead, Mike.

433
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,316
- Jack, it's Mike Novick.
- Hi, Mike.

434
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:24,710
Am I correct in assuming
this suspect is unlikely to respond

435
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:27,234
to the kind of Q and A
his lawyer would permit?

436
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:31,791
Correct. If we want information, we're gonna
have to do it behind closed doors.

437
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:34,872
- Torture him?
- I'm talking about what is necessary

438
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,269
to stop this warhead being used against us.

439
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,915
Give us a moment, Bill.

440
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,514
Mike, what do you think?

441
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:53,071
I think we need to do whatever it takes
to find Marwan.

442
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,557
Walt?

443
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:00,108
Weigh in.

444
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,919
- Well, this makes me nervous.
- Why?

445
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,231
Should this man be innocent,
as he claims he is,

446
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:10,359
your first act as president
is to sanction his torture.

447
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:13,398
That'll forever haunt your presidency.

448
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:28,359
All right, gentlemen.
Here's what I'll agree to.

449
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:34,037
I'll call a session with members of the
Justice Department, and we'll discuss this.

450
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:36,190
I'll have an answer in 20 minutes.

451
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:40,876
- This thing could be over in 20 minutes.
- That's as far as I'm willing to go right now.

452
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:45,272
With all due respect, sir,
please let us do our jobs.

453
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:58,872
I'll get back to you as soon as I can.

454
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:10,550
- I'll have Curtis start the interrogation.
- We can't afford to be wasting time.

455
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,108
You heard. He won't let us touch this guy.

456
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,714
The president's not here. You are.

457
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,598
If I authorise this, they'll know.
We'll all be out.

458
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:21,638
What if I find a way
that wouldn't implicate anyone but me?

459
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:25,076
- I'm not gonna authorise that, Jack.
- You don't have to.

460
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:28,118
- What do you mean?
- Accept my resignation.

461
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,998
- And if I do that, what then?
- Release the suspect.

462
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:34,516
- Release him?
- We don't question him, we don't charge him.

463
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:37,910
He won't need a lawyer or a marshal.

464
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,390
You're gonna take him on as a private citizen?

465
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,956
- <i> Yes. </i>
- How far away are you?

466
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,713
<i>32 miles. </i>

467
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,478
When you get there,
you'll meet with Morrison.

468
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,757
- Is he going to configure the detonation?
- <i>Yes. </i>

469
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,876
I've given him the codes.

470
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:24,949
OK.

471
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,797
You have to follow the plan exactly, Sabir.

472
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,599
We cannot give them time
to start an evacuation.

473
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,672
- Yes, Marwan. I understand.
- No delays.

474
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:37,399
<i>It will be done. </i>

475
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:50,036
- Hey. When did you get back?
- A few minutes ago. Thanks.

476
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:53,999
- I could use your help on the DOD interface.
- I can't help you now. Sorry.

477
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:57,038
- What are you doing?
- I'll tell you when I get back.

478
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,838
Jack?

479
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,911
- Jack?
- Audrey, please.

480
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:10,159
What are you trying to pull? You wanna
torture me, now you're throwing me out.

481
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:14,358
- Right.
- They tried to fight the order and couldn't.

482
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:18,319
No, that's not what this is.
They're doing something.

483
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:22,757
- Don't be so paranoid. We're not interested.
- I want protection when I get out.

484
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:27,118
- The marshal can escort you back...
- No! You know what - change of plan.

485
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,794
I don't wanna leave here until I know I'm safe.

486
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:35,273
If you don't leave, I'll have to arrest you for
trespassing in a secure government building.

487
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:39,911
And once that happens,
not even your attorney can protect you.

488
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,878
Correct me if I'm wrong, David.

489
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,350
He's right.

490
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,795
- What's going on?
- He's been released.

491
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:06,348
- Why?
- I don't know. It came from Buchanan.

492
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:09,034
- Why are you letting him go?
- Not now, please.

493
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:13,591
- He's with the people that killed my mother.
- Not now.

494
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:21,752
- Cheer up. You're a free man.
Yeah, right.

495
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:24,832
- The marshal's gonna take you home.
- No! I can't go home.

496
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,911
I gotta go somewhere public.

497
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:32,393
Fine, tell him where you wanna go.
Don't let anyone know you're there.

498
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:37,838
Here's my card. You call me
if anyone from CTU tries to bother you.

499
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:41,434
Yeah, OK.

500
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,428
You're gonna be fine.

501
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:12,790
Make a sound and I will blow your brains
all over the windshield.

502
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,997
Handcuff your left arm to the dashboard, now.

503
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,431
Now we're gonna talk.

504
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:44,356
Now, you and I both know your heart
isn't in this. You just wanted the money.

505
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:47,079
I don't want you. All I want is Marwan.

506
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:50,152
Marwan? I don't know
what you're talking about.

507
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:56,156
Yeah. Well, I'm running out of time here,
so why don't we just cut to the chase?

508
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:58,910
What?

509
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,709
- Where's Marwan?
- I don't know!

510
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:21,228
Where is Marwan?

511
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:25,233
- Where's Marwan?
- I don't know! I swear I don't know.

512
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:30,189
OK, OK, OK. Marwan's... Marwan's
gonna be at a place called The Hub tonight.

513
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:33,078
- Where is it?
- It's... It's just...

514
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:37,870
- Where is it?
- Just east of downtown. East of downtown.

515
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:42,472
This will help you with the pain.

516
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:16,271
