24 - Season 7
Episode 17

4
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:11,560
Previously on 24 ...

5
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:15,490
Livy, it could take weeks
to find Ethan's replacement.

6
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:19,580
In the meantime, I'm going to
need a provisional chief of staff.

7
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,580
I would like that to be you.

8
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:23,740
I have Larry Moss calling for you.

9
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:28,880
Mam, we have evidence Juma allowed Starkwood to use
Sangala as a base to manufacture biological weapons.

10
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:30,690
Are you saying these
weapons are on US soil?

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,930
We suspect they're at the
Starkwood headquarters in Virginia.

12
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:36,810
And you're not suggesting that Starkwood intends
to use those weapons to attack this country?

13
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,560
Given their actions today, we need
to move on Starkwood immediately.

14
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:43,600
They're coming and they'll be
coming with everything they've got

15
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:49,090
and the only thing that's going to stop them
is getting these weapons ready to deploy.

16
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:51,380
Tell me what the FBI knows.

17
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:54,710
I don't know anything, Mr. Hodges.

18
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,230
Get him out of here and
do what you have to do.

19
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:03,860
I'm not spending the rest of my life in
prison because Jonas Hodges has lost his mind.

20
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:06,040
- You know where the weapons are?
- Yes.

21
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:07,540
Where's Jack?

22
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,470
He managed to secure  the
weapons, but Starkwood got him back.

23
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,160
Jack was exposed.

24
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:15,150
There has to be something
that you can do to help him.

25
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,070
There's no cure.

26
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,240
We got a location on the weapon.

27
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:20,220
We're getting ready to
stage a raid on the compound.

28
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:21,990
I want to go.

29
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,870
I'm sorry. I can't allow it.

30
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,620
I'm the only one who's seen the canisters.
I know exactly what we're looking for.

31
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:27,590
But you're sick.

32
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:30,400
We have no idea when you're
going to start showing symptoms.

33
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:31,910
You're right.

34
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:38,750
Where are the damn weapons?

35
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,190
He played me.

36
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:43,590
Little old Seaton bought us some time.

37
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:46,610
We're going to do a point by point
search of this entire compound.

38
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,270
There are biological
weapons on this facility.

39
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:55,740
We're not going anywhere without them.

40
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:59,300
You try to advance any
farther, you will be fired upon.

41
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:05,280
The following takes place
between 12:00 A.M. and 01:00 A.M.

42
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:14,420
I count three platoons at least.

43
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:16,140
Everything mil-spec.

44
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:18,150
Yeah. They were waiting for us.

45
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,470
This was one big trap.

46
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:23,080
Renee, we would really use
those satellite overheads.

47
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,730
Copy, Larry. What have we got?

48
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:27,030
Nothing. The subnet's been crashing.

49
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,890
Okay, wait, wait, wait. Here we go.

50
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,820
I've got sat five retasking now ...

51
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:33,050
Somebody talk to me.
What are you seeing?

52
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,060
Larry, you've got hostiles on all sides.

53
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:36,830
Damn it. Find me an opening.

54
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,860
I'm looking, but there's no way through.

55
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:42,100
Okay, heads up.
Is everybody seeing this? Larry?

56
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:46,410
Yeah. Yeah. We're seeing it.

57
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,350
It's Hodges.

58
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,500
The men are at the ready, sir.

59
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:05,290
I appreciate your presence.

60
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:07,860
Where else would I be?

61
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:11,620
- Who's in charge here?
- I am.

62
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,720
Agent Moss.

63
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:16,090
You need to move your men
and allow us to proceed.

64
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:20,240
I want you off our property and
I want you to release my man.

65
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,100
You have no right to take him hostage.

66
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,720
I have an order from the
president of the united states.

67
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,170
To search this building.

68
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:31,140
For weapons that do not exist.

69
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,600
Have you looked?

70
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:37,750
Are there weapons of mass destruction?
Are there weapons of any kind?

71
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:41,610
Is there anything in here at all?

72
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:51,450
Agent Moss, who dreamed up this charade?

73
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,890
Give me a name.

74
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:56,570
Let's get to the bottom of this.

75
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:59,160
You want to talk to me, Mr. Hodges?

76
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:01,110
Get these guns off my head.

77
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:03,980
You think you have a gun at your head?

78
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:05,120
You know what I've got?

79
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:08,100
I've got the united states
government sending SWAT teams

80
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:10,310
and attack helicopters in
the middle of the night.

81
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:14,970
I've got a government that I
served faithfully for 30 years

82
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:19,290
dreaming up BS
accusations so politicians

83
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:23,070
too cowardly to show their
faces can dismantle my company.

84
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,400
That's what I've got.

85
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:33,980
You've got five minutes to get
these-these helicopters flying out of here

86
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:36,150
with all of you on board.

87
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,410
You don't want to do this.

88
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,590
Five minutes.

89
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:43,480
And I want my man back.

90
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:52,150
- Renee, you get that?
- Yeah, we did.

91
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,240
- And what options do we have?
- In five minutes?

92
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:57,670
I know there's no time to bring in more
tac support, so give me something else.

93
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,690
All right, Larry, give me a second.
Stand by.

94
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:04,100
That's it.

95
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,640
I want to show you something.

96
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:08,590
Hodges just gave us five
minutes to clear the base.

97
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:11,820
We lost that situation. We were outmaneuvered
but I think I found us a new way in.

98
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:15,280
Look. These are Senator Mayer's files.
This is Douglas Knowles.

99
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:16,670
He's the chairman of Starkwood.

100
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:19,150
He was actually helping the
senator with the investigation.

101
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:21,730
He is the one who brokered the
deal to open the company's books.

102
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,370
What, another insider?
Didn't we just get burned?

103
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:24,820
Just listen.

104
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,630
Knowles was loyal to
Hodges for almost 20 years

105
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:29,390
and now he's secretly helping
the senator take down Starkwood?

106
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:32,190
He's scared of something.
This man wants to help us.

107
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:34,270
It's worth a shot.

108
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:36,950
Yeah. Make the call.

109
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,470
- Knowles.
- Mr. Knowles, my name is Jack Bauer.

110
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,390
I got your number from Senator Mayer.

111
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:49,820
Senator Mayer is dead.

112
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,760
Yes, sir, I know. I was with him when
he was killed by one of your employees.

113
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:55,010
A man named John Quinn.

114
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:01,050
You have no idea how much I
was hoping someone would call.

115
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,990
I'm sorry, sir. I don't understand.

116
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,390
Things are very out of control.

117
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:07,740
Are you aware of what's
happening on your base?

118
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:09,950
I'm watching it with my own eyes.

119
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:12,870
The FBI is pinned down.
They say they're looking for bioweapons.

120
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,700
Sir, Jonas Hodges is in possession
of a military-grade bioweapon.

121
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:19,780
A prion variant developed
in Africa with General Juma.

122
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:21,670
Well, it's not where they think it is.

123
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,790
They're all standing in
front of an empty hangar.

124
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:26,870
The FBI was deliberately led to the
wrong location by a man named Seaton,

125
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:29,160
but I promise you, sir, the
weapon is on your base.

126
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,660
I was contaminated when trying
to intercept the canisters.

127
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:34,370
They were ferried back to Starkwood
approximately 90 minutes ago.

128
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:38,230
90 minutes ago Jonas was handing
down his new strategy to the board.

129
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:42,020
Stonewall the government, no
cooperation whatsoever.

130
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,890
I can't believe this is happening.

131
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:47,330
Sir, this is happening and I promise
you the weapons are on your base.

132
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:50,140
Do you have any idea
where they might be?

133
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,340
I think I might.

134
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,560
Mr. Knowles, I want to put you in
touch with one of my men in the field.

135
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:56,250
- Can I call you right back?
- Yes.

136
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:58,200
Thank you. Go.

137
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,460
Some of the men were unhappy
drawing down on federal agents.

138
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:04,640
It's understandable.

139
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:07,960
I had hoped not to
include the rank and file.

140
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:10,130
You can count on them.

141
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:13,800
Let's show our guests the door.

142
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:16,420
Let's move!

143
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:18,280
Into position.

144
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,930
Jack, I'm on comm.

145
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:29,350
You're on with me and Agent Walker.

146
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:31,380
Hodges' men have
repositioned themselves.

147
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:33,150
Okay, we're going to have to move fast.

148
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:35,770
Larry, I want you and your men
to pull out on Hodges' timetable.

149
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:37,610
Tony, you're going to need
to find a way to stay behind.

150
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,690
We're going to get your vectors over to
a man that we contacted inside Starkwood.

151
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:43,630
His name is Douglas Knowles. He
believes he knows where the weapons are.

152
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,210
Isn't this how we got into this mess?

153
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,800
Almeida and some
supposedly friendly contact?

154
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:49,200
Knowles is chairman
of the Starkwood board,

155
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:51,940
but he was cooperating with Senator
Mayer's investigation of the company.

156
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:54,270
Larry, he is all that we've got.

157
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,670
All right, I got 400 eyeballs
trained on me right now.

158
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,940
How the hell are we supposed
to get Almeida to stay behind?

159
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:03,130
Larry, I need you and your men to create
a diversion to cover Tony's escape.

160
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,730
Look, we need to make this work.

161
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:08,340
If you all get on those helicopters together, we
are going to loose this weapon for good.

162
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:14,620
Larry, are you on board with this?

163
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,340
We got to go.

164
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:20,320
Larry, we need to know, are you on board?

165
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,600
I'll do what I can.

166
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,400
Take his bag.

167
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:30,690
All right, let's go. We're standing down.
You're coming with me.

168
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:33,120
Hey, wait a minute.
This wasn't part of the deal.

169
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:35,620
What deal? As far as I could tell, he
couldn't care about you one way or the other.

170
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:37,190
Moss.

171
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:40,620
You take these handcuffs off of me
or it's going to get really ugly.

172
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,770
Soldier!

173
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:52,920
Get the hell out of here, Moss.

174
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:55,560
You don't want to test us.

175
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:58,810
Let's go!

176
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:39,570
Don't move. No!

177
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:42,400
Doug Knowles.
Jack Bauer sent me. Come on.

178
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,820
That street's solid security cameras.

179
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,320
I'll take you to a restricted area.

180
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:57,090
It's on the east perimeter.

181
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,490
There's a good chance
the weapons are there.

182
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:02,210
The place is crawling. I don't
know how we're going to make it.

183
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,890
I'll take care of that.

184
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,460
Jack, I'm with Knowles.

185
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:09,690
I'm going to need satellite
support on the east perimeter.

186
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:14,030
Jack, I need support. Do you copy?

187
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:17,440
- Jack ... Renee ... Anybody?
- Copy, Tony.

188
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,520
Come on, lets go.

189
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:23,000
I've got you just off the landing pad.
No hostiles in your immediate vicinity.

190
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:24,830
Proceed at your own discretion.

191
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:27,310
Copy that. Which way?

192
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,480
Come on.

193
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:35,610
Jack. You all right?

194
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:38,170
Yeah, I'm fine.

195
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,680
Tony and Knowles have connected.
We're good.

196
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:41,360
It's time to call the
white house with an update.

197
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:43,210
Okay, good. I'll be right there.

198
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,260
Madam president, excuse the interruption.

199
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,550
Jack Bauer is on line seven.

200
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:10,600
Mr. Bauer, tell me you
have the bioweapon.

201
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:12,550
Madam president, I'm
afraid that's not the case.

202
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:15,980
Our search was stopped by armed
mercenaries on Starkwood's base.

203
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:19,750
Agent Moss and his men were forced to withdraw from
a firefight they most certainly would have lost.

204
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,200
Are you saying Hodges men were
ready to fire on federal agents?

205
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,580
Yes, ma'am, that's correct.

206
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:27,640
My god! Who does he think he is?!

207
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:32,100
Madam president, despite the setback,
I am confident the weapons are still there.

208
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:34,040
I reached out to Starkwood's chairman.

209
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:36,060
He's willing to cooperate.
He's with Tony Almeida now.

210
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:40,080
They are moving towards a secure area on the
base where we believe the weapons are being held.

211
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,380
Very good. Tim, what's our troop status?

212
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:45,560
Mobilizing. The secretary of defense
says they're still several hours out.

213
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:50,430
At which point we have a war on our hands
against 1.500 mercenaries armed with bioweapons.

214
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:52,960
Madam president, I do believe that
a surgical air strike will work

215
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,790
as long as we can pinpoint the
exact location of the weapon.

216
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:58,500
- And you can do that?
- Yes, I believe we can.

217
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,420
Mr. Bauer, you've seen the
canisters containing the bioweapons,

218
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:03,130
you know what they look like,
is that correct?

219
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,220
Yes, ma'am.

220
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:08,670
Then we'll need you to verify the
canisters once Almeida has located them.

221
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,970
No more mistakes.

222
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,260
We're gonna need visual confirmation
from you, Bauer-- eyes on.

223
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:16,020
Jack, we have got to get this part right.

224
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:18,300
I understand. Anything else?

225
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,640
Jack, I have been told that you
were exposed  to the pathogen.

226
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:28,010
How you doing?

227
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:31,040
Right now I'fine, madam president.
Thank you for asking.

228
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,360
Thank you for your service.

229
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,510
I'm not giving up on you.
Keep me informed.

230
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:39,640
Yes, ma'am. Let's go.

231
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:52,290
I don't have a lot of time.
What's going on?

232
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,580
That's what I've been trying to ask you.
I called three times.

233
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:56,180
It's kind of crazy here right now.

234
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:58,490
Unless it's urgent,
I gotta call you back.

235
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:01,640
I'm hearing rumors that the
joint chiefs have been called in.

236
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,280
It's not a big deal.

237
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:06,100
They're just doing a final assessment
before lowering the alert level.

238
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,960
Olivia, don't do this.

239
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:10,660
- What? I'm telling you the truth.
- Really?

240
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:14,310
Because I've got a source in
the port authority container yard

241
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:17,010
who's using terms like
"weapons of mass destruction,"

242
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:20,460
so naturally I'm wondering if that's why
the joint chiefs are having a meeting.

243
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:22,920
Look, I can't talk about it.

244
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,410
It's obviously a question
of national security.

245
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:27,560
But you have my word I'll
tell you soon as I can.

246
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:29,800
I want to know now.

247
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:34,550
I just gave you a big story, Ken.
You'll have to wait. I gotta go.

248
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,480
Don't hang up on me, Olivia.

249
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:40,850
That'd be a big mistake.

250
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,930
What's that supposed to mean?

251
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:45,620
You want me to say it, fine, I'll say it.

252
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:47,540
Think how your mother
would feel when she hears

253
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:51,550
that you forced out her chief of staff
so you could take over his position.

254
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:54,830
He was incompetent.

255
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:57,930
Yeah, well, it won't play
that way on the morning news.

256
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:01,060
So, talk to me. Now.

257
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,230
I can't talk here.

258
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:07,930
I'm in the Roosevelt Continental.
Room 1271.

259
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:10,510
You've got half an hour.

260
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,890
Agent Pierce, please get a car ready.

261
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,940
I have to make a quick run.

262
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:30,340
All right, Jack, we're here.

263
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:33,300
Knowles says there's been increased
activity in this area for several days now.

264
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,890
I'm looking at about a
half a dozen buildings.

265
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,100
- Could be any one of them.
- Copy that, Tony.

266
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:39,440
Hold on, we're getting infrared up now.

267
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:42,700
I'm counting seven buildings
in your immediate vicinity.

268
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:48,360
The building directly southeast of your
current position is showing no infrared signal.

269
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:50,680
I'm guessing they're
using a blackout shield.

270
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:52,460
All right, we'll try there first.

271
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,100
You see any patrols coming our way?

272
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,120
Negative, you're clear.

273
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:58,540
Okay, let's go.

274
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,970
Jack, Knowles' key card isn't working.

275
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:17,230
We're gonna need
electronic support here.

276
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:20,750
There should be an R-6 interface
module on the back of your comm device.

277
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:23,640
- It's a card key.
- Yeah, I know what that is, thank you.

278
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:27,880
I'm plugging in now.

279
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:32,360
Okay, we're up. Cormac z series.

280
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:37,240
We're looking at a five digit key
protected by an AES block cipher.

281
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,630
Running combinations.

282
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,380
Okay, Tony, you've got a
vehicle coming your way.

283
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,830
It's east of you about a hundred yards.

284
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:46,990
Take cover down there.

285
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:51,770
- How much longer?
- How much more time do you need?

286
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:54,750
I only have two out of five digits.

287
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,050
We're pretty exposed here.

288
00:15:58,170 --> 00:15:59,180
Jack?

289
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:01,310
It's all right, I'm fine.

290
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,630
Come on.

291
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:18,790
Two more numbers, Tony.

292
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:22,950
What are we gonna do?

293
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,100
We still got two digits to go.

294
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:27,610
Move in for a closer look.

295
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:30,220
- We're not going to make it.
- Sit tight.

296
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,230
Doug,where you--
Doug!

297
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:50,400
Hold your position. May I see some ID?

298
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:54,130
Doug Knowles.

299
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,460
Dammit

300
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:01,260
One to go.

301
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:04,710
I apologize, Mr. Knowles.

302
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,660
Mr. Hodges has ordered the base
cleared of all nonessential personnel.

303
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:11,480
Nonessential personnel?
I'm chairman of the board.

304
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:15,370
I realize that, but we're dealing with
a heightened security situation here.

305
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:17,940
So, I need to know what
you were doing in this area.

306
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:22,420
Jonas called a late night board
meeting, that's what I'm doing here.

307
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:26,740
- Sir, that meeting ended nearly two hours ago.
- We got it. We're in.

308
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:29,770
I don't have to explain
myself to you, you now.

309
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:33,240
I'm sorry, sir, but you do.

310
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:34,920
Sir, I don't believe you're hearing me.

311
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:37,520
No, I don't you're hearing me!

312
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:43,400
Look, I built this company! And I don't need
you telling me where I can and cannot walk!

313
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:44,980
Understood?

314
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:48,190
You're gonna have to come with me, sir.
Right this way.

315
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:55,630
I'm in. But they got Knowles.

316
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,210
Do you think he's gonna say anything?

317
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,770
I don't know.

318
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:01,860
But I better get in and out as fast
as possible just in case he does.

319
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:05,220
Okay, Tony, the president needs a visual on
the weapons before she'll launch an attack.

320
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:08,400
She needs your eyes on the
canisters and a confirmation by Jack.

321
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:11,120
Copy that.

322
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:13,620
- I'm moving.
- Good.

323
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:17,080
Jack?

324
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:19,110
Stay here, I'll be right back.

325
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:27,610
Jack! Jack? Jack! Jack? Jack?

326
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:31,550
Get me the medic!

327
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:42,450
Yes, sir.

328
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,440
We just found Mr. Knowles alone
just outside the restricted zone.

329
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:49,330
Did he have an explanation?

330
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,610
Yes, sir, he said he was walking.

331
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,400
Walking.

332
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:56,480
Should I take him to Stokes
for interrogation, sir?

333
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:59,790
You're suggesting what,
soldier, that we strap him down,

334
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:02,330
extract a confession,
because he was walking?

335
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,690
He's the chairman of the board.

336
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:08,940
I was just requesting instructions, sir.
What you'd like done.

337
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:11,720
I'd like you to take him to his office.

338
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:15,710
Make sure he's comfortable.
And stay with him until I arrive.

339
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,770
Yes, sir. Will that be all?

340
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:21,220
Call zone nine, have them
double down security.

341
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:24,450
Let's make sure that
Mr. Knowles was in fact alone.

342
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,840
Yes, sir.

343
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:40,520
How much longer?

344
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:42,420
Half an hour.

345
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:44,750
Good.

346
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,950
I'll need to know the minute it's done.

347
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,280
Yes, sir.

348
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:57,030
Aaron, I'd like you to wait
in the hall,if that's okay.

349
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:00,980
Ms. Taylor, you tasked me
with handling your security.

350
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:04,890
I can't allow you to enter a
hotel room I haven't vetted.

351
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:10,600
Aaron, I appreciate the concern.

352
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:14,820
But you can see the door from
here, I have you on speed-dial,

353
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:18,460
and I can scream very loudly
when the occasion demands.

354
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,310
I just need two minutes
to wrangle a reporter.

355
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:23,440
Really, I'll be fine.

356
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:26,780
All right, I'll be here if you need me.

357
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:46,390
Want a drink?

358
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,160
No.

359
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:51,760
I assume you don't mind if I do.
It's been a day.

360
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:57,000
I gotta tell you.

361
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,980
I don't like being threatened.

362
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:01,200
It was unfortunate. I apologize.

363
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:03,430
We've known each other a long time, Ken.

364
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:05,880
- I thought we had an understanding.
- We do.

365
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,460
And I want to keep it that way.

366
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:13,230
We both do. Am I right?

367
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:18,090
Okay, so, I told you, I have this source.

368
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,660
Cop out at the port
authority container yard.

369
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:21,540
Okay.

370
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:23,890
He told me he saw these
professional assassin types

371
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:26,640
get into an intense firefight
out there a couple hours ago.

372
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:30,570
According to him, someone hijacked
a WMD out to god knows where.

373
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:34,370
- That's true.
- Yeah.

374
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:37,380
Yeah, I want to know all about it.

375
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:45,020
Look, if you think all you've got to do is
nod your head confirming what I already know,

376
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:47,210
then we've got a problem.

377
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:50,020
It's national security, Ken.
I can't tell you.

378
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:52,080
I'm saying you can.

379
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:55,140
If this story breaks,
it would create a panic.

380
00:21:55,170 --> 00:21:56,730
People would be hurt.

381
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:59,930
If you knew what it was, you'd
understand why it's got to stay a secret.

382
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:02,300
Right, exactly. I'd understand.

383
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:04,870
Have a little faith, okay?

384
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,320
All right.

385
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,400
There is a bioweapon
in the container yard.

386
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:13,560
That's what they were fighting over.

387
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:15,710
It was developed by Starkwood in Africa.

388
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,740
- Starkwood?
- Right.

389
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:20,710
They moved it to their base
about 30 miles from here.

390
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:26,630
So it's there right now.

391
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:33,020
So this is what the joint chiefs
are discussing, what to do about that.

392
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:37,020
Olivia...

393
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:47,070
The president ordered an air strike

394
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:51,790
as soon as the exact location
of the canisters was known.

395
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,270
So you see why you can't run with this?

396
00:22:57,540 --> 00:23:00,670
Really, Ken, you can't.

397
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,860
A lot of lives are at stake.
The entire plan depends on surprise.

398
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:06,600
You get that, right?

399
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:16,450
Maybe you're right.
Maybe I need to kill this story.

400
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:20,030
Thank you.

401
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:24,960
What I mean is maybe
somebody could convince me.

402
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,260
What are you saying?

403
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,510
You know what I'm saying.

404
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,880
You're very beautiful when you get
all patriotic. I ever tell you that?

405
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:37,880
- That's over. We agreed.
- You agreed.

406
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:41,710
Really, I don't want to do this.

407
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:46,210
Ken ...

408
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:49,710
Then say no.

409
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,350
This is pandopamine which
should control the shaking.

410
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:09,080
Here, apply pressure.

411
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:12,450
You can give yourself an
injection once every two hours.

412
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:14,030
More if needed.

413
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:15,450
You think I'll need more?

414
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:17,240
In all likelihood, yes.

415
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:22,860
The onset of symptoms so soon after exposure suggests
the bio-agent is more virulent than we thought.

416
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:26,260
All we're doing here is
just masking the symptoms.

417
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,690
I understand.

418
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:29,870
There's something you may
want to consider, though.

419
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,010
What's that?

420
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:34,100
Bryden University has been funding
some studies on prion diseases.

421
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:38,000
The work is purely experimental at this
point, but it does suggest treatment.

422
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,180
That's good news.

423
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,910
I don't want to get
anyone's hopes up here.

424
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:42,780
We're talking a slight chance.

425
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:46,480
A possible treatment using stem cells
from a genetically compatible donor.

426
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:49,520
An immediate family member would
make the best donor candidate.

427
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:52,150
I saw your file. It says
you have a daughter, right?

428
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,680
I don't want my daughter
involved in this.

429
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:56,800
- Jack, if there's a chance.
- Mr. Bauer ...

430
00:24:56,810 --> 00:24:59,110
Doctor, thank you for
everything you've done.

431
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:01,770
Excuse me. I need to get back to work.

432
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,550
Jack ...

433
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,620
This is none of your business.

434
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:12,640
It's my business when you're having
a seizure in the middle of the FBI.

435
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:14,970
You heard the doctor.
The medition will mask the symptoms.

436
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,500
Why won't you even talk about this?

437
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:18,600
- Talk about what?
- The experimental procedure.

438
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:20,540
Because there's nothing to talk about.

439
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:22,930
She's your daughter, and you're
not even gonna let her know?

440
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:24,720
That's right.

441
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:27,130
So you're just not even gonna try?

442
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:30,510
Renee, I know you're trying to help, but you
don't know what you're talking about here.

443
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,640
My daughter and I, we don't talk, okay?

444
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:36,090
So, please, just let it go.

445
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:41,220
It should be her choice.

446
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,320
Well, it's not.

447
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:46,470
I'm the one who's dying. It's my choice.

448
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:54,910
No sign of the target yet,
but Tony's working on it.

449
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:57,760
- You look better.
- Thanks.

450
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:00,720
Tony, can you hear me?

451
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:01,960
Jack, you okay?

452
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:03,810
Yeah, I'm fine.

453
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,080
Okay, Tony, we're seeing new
activity outside the building.

454
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,620
Two vehicles, eight hostiles.

455
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:10,290
Looks like a security detail.

456
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,560
You think Knowles gave him up?

457
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,240
Tony, they're moving straight
for your point of entry.

458
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:20,290
Eight hostiles and closing.

459
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:22,580
- Yeah, I hear them.
- You want to regroup?

460
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:25,680
No, I want to get this over with.

461
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:38,410
We're clear.

462
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,610
We're clear.

463
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:12,370
I haven't seen you here before.

464
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:15,370
They just sent eight of
us over here, sir.

465
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:17,180
Why, is something wrong?

466
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:20,450
No, sir.
Just, you know, precautions.

467
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:23,460
Right, right.
Can't be paranoid enough.

468
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:33,080
I'm in the main building.

469
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:35,210
Copy, we're with you.

470
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,260
Tony, it's Jack.

471
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:41,000
I've got you at 125 feet MSL, approximately
40 feet underground. Is that correct?

472
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:42,830
That's right. I'm four floors down.

473
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:46,660
We've got no information on any kind of
subterranean floors for that building.

474
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:48,250
Believe me, they're here.

475
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:52,180
Epoxy-hardened walls,
poured concrete ceilings.

476
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:06,760
I have a visual on the weapon.

477
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,970
Sending images for verification now.

478
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:13,160
Copy that.

479
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:26,240
Okay, those are the canisters.

480
00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:29,290
I'll notify Admiral Smith the
target is located and confirmed.

481
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,800
Tony, those are the canisters.

482
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:38,770
Jack, it looks like they're transferring the pathogens
from the canisters into some sort of delivery system.

483
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:42,070
- It's on the move.
- Copy that. It doesn't matter.

484
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,620
Renee's phoning in the coordinates.
Everything's gonna be dust in the next ten minutes.

485
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:49,000
- Get out of there now.
- Copy that. Withdrawing.

486
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,460
Okay, men.

487
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:12,970
You want to explain this, Jonas?

488
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:15,470
I'm arrested by our own security force.

489
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:18,730
Held captive in my own
office like a prisoner.

490
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:23,810
They won't allow me a phone call, even to
you, to find out what the hell is going on!

491
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:28,910
Well, that's a lot of
complaints, Doug. You done?

492
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,520
You were supposed to be home hours ago.

493
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:34,610
Why'd they find you snooping around?

494
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:37,030
I saw the FBI raid.

495
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,720
They say we have bioweapons.

496
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:44,020
Which they did not find.

497
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:45,710
That's not the point.

498
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:48,100
Is it true?

499
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:52,360
Remember when I first brought
you out here 20 years ago?

500
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:54,720
There was nothing here. Nothing.

501
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:59,460
And out of the damn
mud, we built this place,

502
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:03,410
the largest private army in
the hemisphere, maybe the world,

503
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:08,870
and we pulled america's ass out of
the fire again and again and again.

504
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,490
Answer the question!

505
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:14,980
I am.

506
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:20,420
Every day we've done things that the
government itself could not or would not do.

507
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:23,240
"Get this done", that's what
they said, "here's your mission".

508
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:25,520
Nobody asked how anything
was gonna be done.

509
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:27,990
Nobody wanted to know.

510
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,710
All anyone wanted was
results, and we delivered.

511
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,190
No one's questioning that.

512
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:36,460
No one's questioning that?

513
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:38,390
You're not insane, are you?

514
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:41,440
The senate, the committees, the president.

515
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:46,670
Every chattering nonentity in washington is out
there with their standard operating procedures

516
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:49,900
saying
"how was this done? How was that done?"

517
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:54,690
Tearing at us, trying to bring
us down, every one of them.

518
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:58,420
I kept this country strong.
I kept it safe.

519
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:02,010
And I will not be persecuted for that.

520
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:08,540
Jonas, you cannot start a war against
the people you're supposed to protect.

521
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:13,690
We were at war, Doug, the moment
they decided to dismantle us.

522
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:18,950
And as for particular weapons,
as for your question, let me rephrase it.

523
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:21,800
Are we prepared to defend ourselves?

524
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:25,160
We are.

525
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:27,810
Jonas ...

526
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:32,660
You can't take on the
federal government.

527
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:38,080
Yeah, well, you never were
one for thinking big.

528
00:32:38,930 --> 00:32:42,430
20 years I treated you like a son.

529
00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:45,310
20 years.

530
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:48,730
A little loyalty ...

531
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:51,710
wasn't that the least I deserved?

532
00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:43,060
Yes.

533
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:46,510
Sir, we just got an alert from
one of our radar intercepts.

534
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:51,060
There's a squadron of F-18's heading
our way out of virginia beach.

535
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:54,540
- Sir?
- What's the ETA?

536
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:56,130
Less than ten minutes.

537
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,690
- What's our readiness?
- How many?

538
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:02,270
We have three loaded.

539
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:04,900
Place the call to the president.

540
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:07,860
I'll be there momentarily.

541
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:24,310
You probably think I'm the
scum of the earth right now.

542
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:31,010
All I care about is that you
don't run the Starkwood story.

543
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:33,220
You're a real sport.

544
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,830
Taking one for the team like this.

545
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,840
Look at me.

546
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:49,810
You won't run it, right?

547
00:34:52,410 --> 00:34:55,510
- I'm sorry, Livy.
- What?

548
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,720
I have to run it.

549
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:03,100
Breaking something this big will
put me over the top in New York.

550
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:06,450
I'll make sure nobody knows
any of it came from you.

551
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:09,590
You lying son of a bitch.

552
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:11,730
Come on, please.

553
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:14,770
I did what I needed to do
to get ahead-- just like you.

554
00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:17,400
There's no comparison.

555
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:19,650
Running that story
will harm the country.

556
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,510
I've been in Washington
a lot longer than you.

557
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:24,980
You'll see, this is how
the game is played.

558
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:29,160
Actually, Ken, this is
how the game is played.

559
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:33,140
What do you mean?

560
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:51,780
You run that story, or ever
try to blackmail me again,

561
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:56,370
and I'll make sure everyone
knows just how you get your leads.

562
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:59,650
I think your wife will
be especially interested.

563
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:04,410
From everything you've told me,
that's gonna be one nasty divorce.

564
00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:06,960
You bitch.

565
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:08,570
Find a new beat, Ken.

566
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:11,440
I don't want to see you
around the white house again.

567
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,300
Sorry, I've got to take this.

568
00:36:27,701 --> 00:36:28,801
Hi.

569
00:36:28,810 --> 00:36:30,500
Where in the world are you?

570
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:32,130
I'm sorry. I had a meeting on K street.

571
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:34,040
I had to run interference
with a reporter.

572
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:35,810
Are the press on to this?

573
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:37,000
Not anymore. I took care of it.

574
00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:38,190
I need you here, Livy.

575
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:42,060
We've had confirmation on the bioweapons,
and the air strike is happening now.

576
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:44,500
I'll be there in five minutes.

577
00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:57,310
Where are we, admiral?

578
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:02,720
The F-18's have been loaded with bunker-buster
ordinance and will be in range in seven minutes.

579
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:06,300
And what's the risk of the pathogen
spreading to the surrounding areas?

580
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:10,410
Minimal. We're using white phosphorous
charges, which burn at 5,000 degrees.

581
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:12,410
More than enough to
incinerate the pathogen.

582
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,730
And that's been confirmed by the CDC?

583
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:16,820
It has.

584
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:24,650
Weapons are ready?

585
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:26,780
Yes, sir.

586
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:30,670
The call to the president?

587
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:33,260
The call is in process.

588
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,910
This is a historic day, gentlemen.

589
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:39,150
A great day for Starkwood.

590
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,040
Too bad Mr. Knowles can't be joining us.

591
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:07,660
Weapons control status: Yellow tight.

592
00:38:07,730 --> 00:38:11,440
Fighters entering the IP. Engage
airspace coordination area.

593
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:12,570
Roger that.

594
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,790
Stand by.

595
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:16,150
Madam president, command
and control is reporting

596
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:20,260
that a phased array radar system is
active inside the Starkwood compound.

597
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:22,460
Meaning what exactly?

598
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:25,010
They know we're coming.

599
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:28,790
Is there any evidence of an
antiaircraft artillery threat?

600
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,970
Intelligence is indicating no
such capability on the ground.

601
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,480
Madam president, there's a phone
call for you. It's Jonas Hodges.

602
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:43,700
Put him on speaker.

603
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:45,720
Ma'am, he's requested
a private conversation.

604
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:49,840
He says he's established a
proprietary line in the ops room.

605
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:52,430
A proprietary line?

606
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,090
How did he manage that?

607
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,780
I have no idea.

608
00:39:23,290 --> 00:39:24,210
Hello.

609
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:29,220
Madam president, let me begin by saying
that I am truly sorry it's come to this.

610
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:33,350
But I have to insist that you turn your
planes around immediately.

611
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:37,880
You're in no position to
issue ultimatums, Mr. Hodges.

612
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:40,040
Well, maybe I am.

613
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:46,130
You remember several years ago, madam
president, Starkwood was deployed to Pakistan.

614
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:49,450
Oh, I remember it very well.
I fought that deployment.

615
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:51,140
And you lost.

616
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:55,250
You'll also recall that we requisitioned
a missile system at that time--

617
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,810
python fives.

618
00:39:56,840 --> 00:40:00,060
Well, three of those missiles
are now loaded with the pathogen

619
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:03,510
and aimed at cities on
our eastern seaboard.

620
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:09,030
You're bluffing.

621
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:13,830
As a sign of good faith, I'm
willing to show you that I'm ...

622
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:16,490
that I'm not bluffing.

623
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:23,670
You see that? Madam president?

624
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:36,700
You call this good faith? You are
waging war on your own country, Jonas.

625
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:39,730
Well, of course,
I wouldn't see it that way.

626
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,090
What do you want?

627
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:47,810
Well, we can have that conversation
a little later on at the white house.

628
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:51,380
You think we're going to just
sit down and discuss this?

629
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:56,670
Yes I do, in the oval office, in
confidence, within the hour.

630
00:40:57,120 --> 00:41:00,920
But in the meantime, I think
it is to both of our advantage

631
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:05,480
that the american people do not know
the exact circumstance of this standoff.

632
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:09,790
So you will keep this conversation to
yourself, and turn the planes around.

633
00:41:09,830 --> 00:41:12,510
And if you do not comply, madam president,

634
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:17,240
I will have no choice but
to launch those missiles.

635
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:20,710
Mr. Hodges ...

636
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:25,380
And remember, I can detect any
action you take against our facility.

637
00:41:25,410 --> 00:41:28,060
You have 30 seconds.

638
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:31,770
Mr. Hodges ... Mr. Hodges!

639
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:02,620
Abort the air strike, Admiral Smith.

640
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:04,250
Madam president ...

641
00:42:04,290 --> 00:42:06,540
Just do as I say.

642
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:12,210
Ma'am, with all respect ...

643
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:15,990
Damn it, Admiral, abort the
air strike immediately!

644
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,490
This is Admiral Smith. I have an
abort order from the president.

645
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:20,900
Take fighters off target.

646
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:23,940
Repeat: Take fighters off target.

647
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:26,570
Stand by for confirmation code.

648
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,820
Roger that.

649
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:37,330
We're standing down, madam president.
