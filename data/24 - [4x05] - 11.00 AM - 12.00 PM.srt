1
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:18,750
I am the Secretary of Defense of the United
States of America. You will listen to me.

2
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,552
Put down your weapon.

3
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:32,351
If another one of my men dies,
your daughter will be killed.

4
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,877
- We need to get out of here. You're in danger.
- From who?

5
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,838
Don't ask questions, just come with me.

6
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,512
Debbie, what's wrong?

7
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,319
Debbie, Debbie, what's wrong?

8
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,352
What did you do to her?

9
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,636
- O'Brian.
- Is the satellite up yet?

10
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,837
No, I have to reposition
without Driscoll noticing. Where are you?

11
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,356
I'm in a Mercury Mart. I staged a robbery.

12
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:04,035
Tell those officers
to put their guns down and stand back.

13
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:06,795
- I need you to help me.
- With what?

14
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,553
- I've been in contact with Jack Bauer.
- What?

15
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:14,873
- That's right. So either help me or turn me in.
- This could get me fired.

16
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,871
I know you were working with her.

17
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,748
- What do you want?
- I want your attention whenever I need it.

18
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:25,159
Chloe, why are you logged on
to an active DOD satellite?

19
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,312
- All right, you're done here.
- I was gonna quit anyway.

20
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,799
I want you to call Jack Bauer now.

21
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,475
- Driscoll wants to talk.
- Stand down. It's over.

22
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,518
Erin, Hasan is free.
He's looking for a car and a phone.

23
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,434
<i>Once he has those things</i>
<i>he'll lead us straight to Heller. </i>

24
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,439
Son of a bitch.

25
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,592
Get out of the car.
Get your hands up

26
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,274
and step out of the vehicle.

27
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,799
Do we still have a sat visual on Kalil Hasan?

28
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,077
West of the 14 on Route 11.
Average speed, 62 miles per hour.

29
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,355
I want traffic workups.

30
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,591
We can't let anything prevent him
from reaching his destination.

31
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,399
Key the tactical teams to Jack's location.

32
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,519
- Want me to pre-empt that with Division?
- Yes, we'll run point.

33
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,672
I can pull up those tactical teams for you,
if you want.

34
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:27,630
You can't. That requires a level-three channel.
You don't have that kind of clearance.

35
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:31,633
I have a Sergeant Paulsen
from the Sheriff's Department on line one.

36
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,109
He says it's important.

37
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,914
Sergeant Paulsen.
This is Erin Driscoll at CTU.

38
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,477
I have a man named Jack Bauer in custody.
He claims he works with you. Is that true?

39
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,791
- Yes, it is.
- <i>He just robbed a convenience store. </i>

40
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:54,509
Claims it was part of some
undercover operation to delay a suspect

41
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,353
until satellite coverage could be established.

42
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,797
- That's also true, Sergeant.
- It'd be nice if you communicated with us.

43
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,599
There were
some national security issues involved.

44
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,797
I'm sorry for any inconvenience.
May I speak to Mr Bauer?

45
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,880
All right. Uncuff him.

46
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,831
Thank you.

47
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,434
- Tell me that you didn't arrest Hasan.
- No.

48
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,954
He's still in the vehicle, we're tracking him.

49
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:28,318
An intercepted phone call indicated
he's headed for the site where Heller's held.

50
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,119
You'll need me
to coordinate things on the ground.

51
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,193
We can get Heller and Audrey out of there,
but we need to work together.

52
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,592
<i>We have to find Heller before this trial starts. </i>

53
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:44,398
That's the right move, Erin.
He's our only option.

54
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,517
All right, you're in, but you coordinate
through me. And Jack, make this work.

55
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:54,991
I will. Please advise Sergeant Paulsen
of the new chain of command.

56
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:58,117
- Yep.
- In my capacity as director of CTU,

57
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:02,352
I'm vesting Jack Bauer with the authority
to control this part of the operation.

58
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,396
Consider him in charge.

59
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,550
- Yes, ma'am.
- Thank you.

60
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,074
You're the new boss. Tell me what you need.

61
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:13,233
The vehicle the hostile was driving
was stolen. If there's an APB on it,

62
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,880
- I need you to get CHP to cancel it.
- Get on it.

63
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,349
I left my CTU vehicle at the convenience mart.

64
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:22,228
- I'll have it brought right over.
- Thank you.

65
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,308
- Hasan's making another phone call.
- Patch it through to Jack.

66
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,677
- Bauer.
- It's Edgar Stiles.

67
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:52,072
Hasan's making another phone call.
I'm patching it to you.

68
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,599
- <i> Yes?</i>
- It's Kalil. I'm on my way.

69
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,478
- How much longer?
- About a half an hour.

70
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,358
<i>The broadcast must begin on time. </i>

71
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,194
- Any problems?
- Nothing I couldn't handle.

72
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,555
How are you coming with the servers?

73
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:11,110
Duman and Farez are managing,
but they could use your help.

74
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,839
- I'll be there soon.
- All right.

75
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,433
- Did Heller sign the confession?
- Yes.

76
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,593
He didn't want to, but we used his daughter.

77
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:25,353
Did you kill her?

78
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,634
<i>Not yet. </i>

79
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,190
- What's the ETA on my vehicle?
- Any second, Agent Bauer.

80
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,314
I'll see you soon.

81
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,476
Play it back.

82
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,509
- Tell your men to stay on channel three.
Got it.

83
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:12,474
Dad, you did what anyone else
would have done in your position.

84
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:18,952
- I embarrassed my country.
- You signed a piece of paper.

85
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:23,272
All lies. Everyone will know
that you signed it under duress.

86
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,033
It's more than a piece of paper.

87
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,669
This trial is gonna be a spectacle,
broadcast all over the world.

88
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:33,070
Designed to humiliate
and degrade this country.

89
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,833
Dad,

90
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,229
there's still time.

91
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:43,872
There's no sense in deluding ourselves.
There's less than an hour.

92
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,759
If we're gonna do anything,
we have to do it now.

93
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,638
We've done everything that we can.

94
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,756
Not quite.

95
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,434
What do you mean?

96
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:02,959
What if I'm not alive?
They can't put me on trial.

97
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,873
If I'm dead,
their goals go right out the window.

98
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:09,396
And they'll be viewed
as nothing more than common assassins.

99
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,313
- Dad.
- Listen to me.

100
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,234
Even if I say what they want me to say,
they're not gonna let me go.

101
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:19,278
They're gonna put me
in front of a camera, humiliate me,

102
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,512
and then they're gonna kill me
with the whole world watching.

103
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:27,309
There are people on the outside
looking for us. You cannot give up.

104
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:31,109
I have to do something while I still can.

105
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,754
And I need you to help me.

106
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,913
Help you?

107
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,120
The chain between your handcuffs.
See if you can get it up and around my neck.

108
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,760
- No.
- I can't do it myself.

109
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:50,150
I don't have any leverage.
But you can pull from back there.

110
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,629
- Dad.
- I'm counting on you to help me.

111
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,678
- Stop it. Stop it. Stop it!
- Give it a try at least. Try it!

112
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,876
I won't do it.

113
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,549
I won't do it, Dad.

114
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,357
There's a gas pipe.

115
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,796
- If we could break it...
- No.

116
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,550
Break that, you die too.

117
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,639
Do you think
that they're gonna let me out of here alive?

118
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,472
Do you?

119
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:40,154
They're gonna kill me, too.

120
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,517
Dad.

121
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,360
Together we can do this. We can do it.

122
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,317
OK?

123
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:08,114
Please.

124
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,555
Let's try it.

125
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,958
Almost there. OK.

126
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,156
That's good.

127
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,749
- You ready?
- Yeah.

128
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:56,196
- I love you.
- I love you, too, honey.

129
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,115
I want a full analysis on both these voices.

130
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:20,273
- OK. I'll have it done in ten minutes.
- OK. Good.

131
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,397
- Edgar.
- What, Marianne?

132
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:28,199
- What's a level-three channel?
- A log on for all systems,

133
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,510
tactical, district and division.

134
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,353
- I want it.
- What do you mean?

135
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:39,436
- I want clearance for a level-three channel.
- Only Driscoll can authorise that.

136
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,476
I don't care. I want it.

137
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:50,317
Just because you overheard Chloe and me,
doesn't mean I'm your bitch.

138
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,399
I'm done being scared of you.

139
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,876
- Ms Driscoll. It's Marianne.
- <i>Yes, Marianne. What is it?</i>

140
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:10,794
I have further information regarding
Chloe circumventing your authority.

141
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,998
- <i>I'm listening. </i>
- I don't think she was acting alone.

142
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,753
<i>Who was she working with?</i>

143
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,319
I'm not sure. I found an echo on her call log.

144
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,710
Every time she spoke to Jack,
there was someone else on the line.

145
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:31,351
<i>That's an automated behaviour. </i>
<i>It doesn't mean anyone else was on the line. </i>

146
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,908
<i>Is that the extent of your suspicions?</i>

147
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,156
Yes. I'm sorry to have bothered you.

148
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,240
- You're sick.
- You're gonna go to Driscoll,

149
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,550
and you're gonna tell her
you need some help.

150
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:49,679
And you're gonna ask her to issue me
a level-three channel clearance.

151
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:08,278
- Unit Three, this is Bauer. Do you copy?
- <i> Copy. </i>

152
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:11,989
- Back off another 200 yards.
- <i>Roger that. </i>

153
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,832
- <i> Jack. </i>
- Yeah.

154
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,150
The marines are leaving base.

155
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,391
Have Chloe collate the satellite images.

156
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:22,074
Chloe's in a holding room.
She's been suspended.

157
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:26,312
- We could use her help.
- It's under control. Curtis can collate them.

158
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,516
Chloe was just doing what I asked her to.

159
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,672
- She was supposed to be working for me.
- I understand, but...

160
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,833
Jack, it's one thing
for you to disobey me in the field,

161
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,957
but for someone who works for me
here at CTU to betray me...

162
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,508
I can't reactivate her.
It's a nonstarter.

163
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,558
Anything else?

164
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,596
No, nothing else.

165
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:09,157
- We have a situation here.
- I realise that. I can do the math.

166
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,633
- The math?
- The protocols were violated.

167
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,589
Someone has to take the bullet.
Jack's indispensable right now, and I'm not.

168
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,195
- Took a lot of guts to do what you did.
- I trusted Jack.

169
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:27,196
A lot of people around here trust Jack.
Doesn't mean they'll risk their careers for him.

170
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,388
I have a suggestion.

171
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,677
I'm gonna leave this room, call Admin.

172
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:39,350
They'll fax over some resignation papers,
and you sign them.

173
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,671
- And then what?
- And then nothing.

174
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:45,479
- I walk out?
- You walk out.

175
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,230
No jail? No sanctions?

176
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,232
That's right.

177
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,471
Though if you need a letter
of recommendation for your next job,

178
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,870
you probably should get it from Jack, not me.

179
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,439
Right.

180
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,875
Sound like a plan?

181
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,712
Yes.

182
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:21,399
For God's sake, pull yourself together.

183
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,869
She knew nothing.
You didn't have to kill her.

184
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:27,794
Yes, I did. Because you didn't
have the courage to kill her yourself.

185
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:31,509
Courage? To poison a girl
who did no harm to you at all?

186
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,595
Your father's home.

187
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,790
What are you doing? She's already dead.

188
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,599
If he doesn't see a bullet wound,
he'll ask questions.

189
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,150
Do you want him to know
you tried to help your girlfriend escape?

190
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,629
Do you want him to know
you failed him again?

191
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,280
Move away.

192
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:04,074
Take it. Take it.

193
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,789
Behrooz, take it! Take it.

194
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,558
This has to stop, Behrooz.
You are my son, and I love you,

195
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:16,029
but I cannot let you destroy everything.

196
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:21,194
Everything we've worked so hard to achieve.

197
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,199
I know this was difficult for you.

198
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,953
But it was necessary.

199
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:55,555
He'll dispose of the body tonight, after dark.

200
00:15:55,640 --> 00:16:01,237
Meanwhile, move her car.
Park it somewhere where it won't be seen.

201
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:04,790
Then come straight back here. Navi.

202
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,393
What?

203
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,950
- You got your level-three channel clearance?
- Yes, I did.

204
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:03,036
So we're done, right? I mean, I don't think
I should have to keep doing things for you.

205
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,548
Why do you need a level-three clearance?

206
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,110
You may be happy tapping
at a keyboard forever, but I'm not.

207
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:17,194
I've an opportunity here to get ahead,
and I intend to use it.

208
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,915
That's mine.

209
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,555
I'll be right back.

210
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:47,473
I'm more insulted you thought I wouldn't
notice than by the fact you spied on me.

211
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,630
Driscoll ordered me to do it.

212
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:54,794
Next time, use a Newman filter so the subject
doesn't see red lights flashing everywhere.

213
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,836
Amateur.

214
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,797
Bye, Edgar.

215
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:04,510
Could you cover for me for just a second?

216
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,276
Chloe.

217
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,875
Could you guys give me a moment, please?

218
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:15,113
- I'm really sorry this happened.
- Don't worry.

219
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,557
- Driscoll doesn't know you were helping me.
- She doesn't?

220
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:23,394
I'm the one who got you into this.
I'm not gonna sell you out.

221
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,152
Thank you.

222
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,435
You're a geek, Edgar.

223
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,080
But you're a good guy. Stay that way.

224
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,869
- I don't really have a choice.
- I guess not.

225
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,997
Good luck today. You're gonna need it.

226
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,552
Assuming he continues driving west,
what are our potential target areas?

227
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:23,714
Hasan will reach one of four residential
communities and two industrial areas.

228
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:28,191
Data mine those areas. Search for any
suspicious activity in the last six months.

229
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:31,556
Citizen complaints,
known associates, everything.

230
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:34,837
Jack, the hostile's stopping
on an intersection.

231
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,873
OK. I got him.

232
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,072
Yo, Mohammed.

233
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:22,472
That's your name, right?
Ain't that what they call all you people?

234
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:25,870
- I'm just trying to get home.
- Be nice if all y'all went home.

235
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,190
Three men have approached Hasan's vehicle.

236
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:32,114
- Edgar, can you enhance this?
- Hang on.

237
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:36,631
- I don't want any trouble.
- Too late, Mohammed.

238
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,995
Don't slip up. I'm watching you.
Say nothing, got that?

239
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,038
You three. Stay right there.

240
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,956
The police have got to stay clear.

241
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:57,032
I ordered a cancellation
of the APB on the truck.

242
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,590
It may not have gotten out yet
to all the local CHP branches.

243
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:04,559
If they detain Hasan, he'll never
lead us to Heller. Put me through to CHP.

244
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,234
Sarah.

245
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:10,198
I have a priority call for local dispatch.

246
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:18,317
- Do you wanna move this vehicle, please?
Yes, sir.

247
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,674
Step out of the truck, please, sir.

248
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,711
What's going on here?

249
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,758
Working some things out
between him and I. That's all.

250
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:37,434
- Is that right?
- Yes, sir.

251
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,956
You three, stand by your car.

252
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,270
Come on.

253
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:48,153
We're gonna lose him. Get me CHP now.

254
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,712
Wanna tell me what's going on here?

255
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,155
There's really no problem, Officer.

256
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,834
They're upset
about what happened this morning.

257
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:59,798
Sorry about that, sir.

258
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,838
- May I go now?
- Just bear with me one minute.

259
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,993
- Why don't you go ahead and call this in?
- Copy that.

260
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,670
Jack, I have local CHP dispatch.

261
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:19,194
- Patch 'em through.
- <i>This is Officer Calvert. </i>

262
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,840
I cancelled an APB
on a yellow pick-up truck,

263
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:25,833
licence plate number four,
Los Angeles, Independent, nine, four, five.

264
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,673
<i>I see it in the system. </i>
<i>I haven't had a cancellation. </i>

265
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:31,194
One of your officers
is questioning the driver.

266
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:35,831
It is imperative that
that driver not be detained any longer.

267
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,354
We'll get you on your way
as soon as possible.

268
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:46,319
It's just routine. Don't let those guys
get to you. They're just punks.

269
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,675
Yeah. I understand.

270
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:54,357
I think everybody's been a bit jumpy today,
with everything that's going on.

271
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,398
Thanks for your patience.
It won't be another minute.

272
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,710
<i> 6214, come in. </i>

273
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,677
LA6214. Copy.

274
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:06,309
- <i>6214, there's a 10-22 on the 2-15.</i>
- Roger that.

275
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,879
<i>10-1.</i>

276
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,550
We're all clear.

277
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,596
Have a nice day, sir.

278
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,750
Thank you, sir.

279
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,830
He's moving.

280
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,829
- He's making another call.
- Pipe it through to Jack.

281
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:44,229
<i> Jack, Kalil's making another call. </i>

282
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:47,558
Finish the set up, and let's do a test.

283
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,469
Yes?

284
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:53,120
- <i> We may have a problem. </i>
- I'm listening.

285
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,112
The police ran the plates
of the vehicle I'm driving.

286
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,760
- And?
- They let me go.

287
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:01,070
- Jack, are you getting this?
- Yeah.

288
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:05,073
- <i>What is the problem?</i>
- This is a stolen car.

289
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:08,277
- Maybe the owner hasn't reported it yet.
- Maybe I'm getting help

290
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,954
from people who wanna make sure I get there.

291
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:13,031
Do not jump to conclusions.

292
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,157
A police officer was approaching me,
his hand on his gun.

293
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,800
He got a call, suddenly there's no problem.

294
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,117
We can't take any chances.

295
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:31,352
He's not gonna lead us to the site. The best
we can do is take him alive and break him.

296
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,398
All units. Move in. I repeat, move in.

297
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:44,075
OK, I've got a visual.
Set up a roadblock at mile-marker 15.

298
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:49,109
It has been an honour
working with you, Omar.

299
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,998
The honour has been mine, Kalil.

300
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,719
Come on.

301
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,677
<i>Allah Akbar. </i>

302
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,871
<i>Allah Akbar. </i>

303
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,155
No!

304
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,549
He drove head-on into another vehicle.

305
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:40,234
He was our only lead.

306
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:03,749
Edgar, were you able
to trace the call?

307
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:07,992
OK. We're gonna switch gears,
since we've lost our only lead.

308
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,356
Kalil Hasan committed suicide
en route to Heller's location.

309
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,159
Have they recovered anything
that might help?

310
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,516
It's too soon to tell.
They're still putting out the fire.

311
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,114
How much time do we have before this trial?

312
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,714
Ten, fifteen minutes.

313
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,472
- Sarah Gavin.
- <i>It's me. </i>

314
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,915
- It's Jack.
- Put him on speaker.

315
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,274
<i> Go ahead. </i>

316
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:31,238
I'm sifting through the wreckage,
there's not much intact.

317
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:35,029
Hasan said he was 30 minutes
from his destination 20 minutes ago.

318
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,315
- Do we have a maximum perimeter?
- Edgar?

319
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,709
A radius of 60 miles, centred at Acton.

320
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:42,678
We're dispatching choppers
to survey the area.

321
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:46,116
That'll take too long.
Use the satellites, conduct a thermal scan.

322
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:50,034
Won't work. There's a high
concentration of electric power transmitters.

323
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:52,395
<i>The satellite can't distinguish the servers. </i>

324
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:57,634
Those transmitters have been there for years.
Lay a scan against the previous grid pattern.

325
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:00,109
We can identify any new thermal activity.

326
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,555
- We can start the scan immediately.
- Do it.

327
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,349
We're using the satellite
to check the thermals. Keep the line open.

328
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,475
Hurry.

329
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:11,109
The clinic wanted me to tell you
that your daughter has arrived.

330
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,838
Thank you.

331
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:17,869
All right. Everyone reset your systems.
Let's get back on track.

332
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:22,476
I have to take care of something. Check in
with Division, they're expecting an update.

333
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:26,348
- Everything all right?
- I had to bring my daughter to the clinic.

334
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:29,432
- Is she OK?
- She's fine. Call Division.

335
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,555
What are you working on?

336
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:44,871
Personnel allocations
and tactical generals for the teams.

337
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:50,239
Every time I look over here,
you're talking to Edgar. What's that all about?

338
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,949
Just trying to learn the ropes, Curtis.

339
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:59,869
Today is not the day
to make career moves on people, Marianne.

340
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:04,112
You should be thinking about how to help us
stop Heller from being executed.

341
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:07,272
- Come on, Curtis. Give me some credit.
- Save it.

342
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:13,356
I know how you think. Just leave everybody
alone, and help us get through today.

343
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,559
Mark.

344
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,677
Thank you for helping me out.
They said Maya's arrived.

345
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:27,469
She's in the exam area.
We're about to do a workup.

346
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,833
She's been on Thorazine.
She stopped taking it.

347
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:34,674
- How long ago?
- Based on this morning, at least a few days.

348
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:37,433
- What?
- She was fixating on a neighbour's kid.

349
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,954
- What does she do?
- She walks into their yard,

350
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,110
gets verbally abusive.

351
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:45,670
- We'll take good care of her.
- Thank you.

352
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:54,875
- Maya.
- I'm so happy to see you. I was going crazy.

353
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,030
Why did you go over to Evan's?

354
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:03,832
I know you said not to,
but he was throwing things against the fence.

355
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:08,710
Maya. He plays with a ball.
He's seven years old, sweetheart.

356
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,758
I don't care how old he is.
He should know better.

357
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:15,879
Are you gonna talk to his dad about this?

358
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,349
Come here.

359
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,955
Look at me.

360
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:30,551
You're not thinking clearly, honey.
You've got to put it out of your mind.

361
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:35,316
Dr Kaylis is gonna help,
and you're gonna feel better very soon.

362
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:38,437
- Why don't we go home, right now?
- We can't, honey.

363
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,476
Why not?

364
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:46,914
There's a little trouble here in LA,
and I have to take care of it.

365
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,834
- Are you gonna be OK?
- Yes, I'm gonna be OK.

366
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,591
And you're gonna be OK.

367
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:56,513
I love you so much.

368
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:00,518
- I love you too, honey.
- I love you.

369
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:03,751
It's gonna be OK.

370
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,193
Shh.

371
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:09,953
It's OK. It's OK.

372
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,793
- Yes.
- <i> Kalil is dead. </i>

373
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,632
Dead? How?

374
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:21,272
He was being followed here.
He martyred himself. Without hesitation.

375
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:24,796
And the servers? Have they been
reconformed for the broadcast?

376
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,316
Duman is doing his best.
I think we'll be all right.

377
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:32,552
- If you need help, I can come.
- No, no, no, no. It is too risky.

378
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:37,589
If the servers don't work correctly, we're
in trouble. This trial is only the beginning.

379
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:40,558
I know that as well as you, my friend.

380
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:45,589
But there's no need to worry.
Everything will go as planned.

381
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,753
- You've checked out the briefcase?
- It's fine.

382
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,877
I was afraid it might be damaged,
in the train crash.

383
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:56,111
The case is very strong.
There's no problem.

384
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,794
Good. Then you can get started.

385
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:05,315
Gas.

386
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:08,198
I smell gas.

387
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,316
Heller.

388
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:21,157
Get them out. Now! Come on.

389
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,670
Hurry. Let's go.

390
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,955
Take them out.

391
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,835
Come on.

392
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,798
Put them down. Put them down now.

393
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:41,831
Hurry. Open the door. Now!

394
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:45,754
Come on. Do whatever it takes to revive him.

395
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,316
Keep trying.

396
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,553
I know you.

397
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:18,598
She recognised me.
She has to be killed.

398
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:21,114
She will. In good time.

399
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,751
Go do your job.

400
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,193
Go.

401
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,237
- <i> Jack, it's Erin. </i>
- Yeah.

402
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:35,710
We got the results from the scan.
One site matches the criteria.

403
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:39,634
- Where?
- An old industrial park, three miles from you.

404
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:42,678
- Exact address?
Off a service road, south of Brock.

405
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:45,672
I'll set up the area.
Where's the marine strike force?

406
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,399
20 minutes away. This trial starts any minute.

407
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,550
I'll get back to you soon as I'm on site.

408
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:54,076
Download the schematics of the building
and send them to me.

409
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,354
Edgar's on it.

410
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:13,279
- Pick the rest of these up later.
Yes, Mr President.

411
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:16,477
- What is it, Robert?
- CTU thinks it's identified the location

412
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,710
where the terrorists are holding Heller.

413
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:21,234
- Where?
- A compound in Santa Clarita.

414
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:25,836
There is a problem. The teams may not
get there in time to prevent the broadcast,

415
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:31,677
and even they do, there is a good chance the
secretary will be killed in any rescue attempt.

416
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:36,470
Well, we have no choice
but to hope and pray that you're wrong.

417
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:40,951
We do have a choice.
The secretary's death would be tragic,

418
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:45,272
but his execution on American soil,
broadcast to the world, would be far worse.

419
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:49,194
It would be a humiliation for the country.
Perhaps the worst in our history.

420
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:54,308
I'm well aware of that. But unless you have
some solution, I'm missing the point.

421
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:57,233
The solution is, we make a pre-emptive strike.

422
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:00,039
Assuming we locate the site in time,
we destroy it.

423
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:05,069
- We kill our own secretary of defense?
- To prevent the public spectacle of his death.

424
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,754
He's going to be killed anyway.

425
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,869
Jim Heller is a good friend.

426
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,519
A loyal public servant.

427
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:27,230
You expect me to kill him to save face?

428
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:30,551
Not yours, sir. The country's.

429
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:34,679
If we look impotent in this situation,
we'll only encourage more attacks.

430
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:39,356
And if I may say so, sir, having known
Jim Heller many years myself, if he were here,

431
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:44,468
- he'd be the first to endorse this plan.
- The public will never accept it.

432
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:48,394
All the public will know
is the secretary died during a rescue attempt,

433
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:54,476
which is more palatable than letting him
be executed with the whole world watching.

434
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:32,508
It's a woman. I don't know her.

435
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,151
God.

436
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,913
- Who is she?
- It's Debbie's mom.

437
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,151
- Go back. Stay there until she leaves.
- What are you gonna do?

438
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,834
Go.

439
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:54,909
- It's the girl's mother.
- What?

440
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,152
- Mrs Araz?
- Yes.

441
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:03,870
- I'm Karen Pendleton, Debbie's mother.
- Oh, good to meet you. Call me Dina.

442
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:07,748
It's good to meet you. My husband and I
are very fond of Behrooz.

443
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:12,470
He's one of the few boys who seem to know
the meaning of "please" and "thank you".

444
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,915
Oh, I'm looking for Debbie.

445
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:19,596
This is my husband Navi.
This is Debbie's mother.

446
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,911
- Oh, she's a very lovely girl.
Thank you.

447
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,073
We got a call from our dermatologist.
She missed her appointment. Is she here?

448
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:29,435
We haven't seen her since yesterday.

449
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:33,229
- She was on her way to see Behrooz.
- There must be a misunderstanding.

450
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:37,074
- Perhaps she stopped off.
- No, she knew she had this appointment.

451
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:39,720
It'll take weeks to reschedule.

452
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:44,198
- Is Behrooz here?
- He is studying.

453
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,396
- Maybe he knows where she is.
- I doubt it.

454
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:52,635
He hasn't left his room all morning.
School is very important to him.

455
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:00,074
That's her phone. I know the ring.

456
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,958
Many... Many phones sound alike,
Mrs Pendleton.

457
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:08,478
No, she downloaded that ring specially.
It's one of her favourite songs.

458
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:13,076
- No, that's definitely her phone.
Mrs Pendleton.

459
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:18,353
It was my phone. Debbie and I downloaded
the same ring when we started going out.

460
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:21,591
Oh. Do you know where she is?

461
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:25,033
She said she had
a doctor's appointment this morning,

462
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:28,396
and we're supposed to go to the movies later.

463
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:33,075
I'm sorry about this. I'm just worried.

464
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,434
If you do see her, will you have her call me?

465
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:39,353
- Oh, yes. Of course.
- Of course.

466
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,959
- I told you not to interfere.
- It was her phone. I shut it off.

467
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,235
He took care of it, Navi.

468
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:52,073
She went away because she believed him.

469
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,469
Let's hope so.

470
00:37:56,520 --> 00:38:00,069
Get in the car. Follow her.
Make sure she doesn't go to the police.

471
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,355
All right.

472
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,714
Have you worked up the rescue approach?

473
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,836
We're running up scenarios now.

474
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:30,629
What are the probabilities of finding
the secretary and his daughter?

475
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:34,679
The data's fuzzy, but at best guess,
they're in the west end of the building.

476
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,671
- Together?
- We don't know.

477
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:40,196
We need a team split -
one for the secretary, one for his daughter.

478
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:42,714
We discussed that, but it was rejected.

479
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,712
- What are you talking about?
- It comes from the president.

480
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:50,351
There'll be very little time to secure
the hostages. Our priority is to get Heller.

481
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:55,230
- That doesn't make sense.
- I don't like it, but those are the orders.

482
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:59,593
Jack, they're about to begin the broadcast.

483
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,989
I'm almost there.

484
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,308
Dammit.

485
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:32,957
<i> We are about to embark on a process</i>
<i>of justice that will forever change the world. </i>

486
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:37,636
Our people will finally be liberated
from the tangle of corruption

487
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:40,518
<i>that has been choking them for centuries. </i>

488
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:44,639
<i>No longer will justice</i>
<i>be the propagandist tool of the power elite. </i>

489
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:47,837
<i>It will once again</i>
<i>become the instrument of the people,</i>

490
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,718
<i>delivered through true believers,</i>

491
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:57,273
whose courage to use the sword has made
this day not only possible, but inevitable.

492
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:01,672
I've taken the liberty of having a laser-guided
missile programmed and prepped.

493
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:07,517
- All that remains is for you to give the order.
- How long between my order and impact?

494
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:12,196
The fighter's in the air, it needs
to get in range. No more than ten minutes.

495
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:17,832
<i>... without prejudice. For we will be judged,</i>
<i>the same as our enemies,</i>

496
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,434
<i>as our prisoner shall be judged today. </i>

497
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:23,353
Do it. Let Driscoll know.

498
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:28,594
<i>Today is the day</i>
<i>the United States of America will be tested... </i>

499
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,671
<i> It's been authorised, ma'am. </i>

500
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,955
Yes, I understand.

501
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,159
Yeah?

502
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:52,471
- <i> Ms Driscoll for you. </i>
- <i> What's your position?</i>

503
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:53,913
I'm on site.

504
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,311
Jack, stand down.

505
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,913
What are you talking about?

506
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,118
The president wants to take out
the building with a missile strike.

507
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:05,431
- With the secretary and his daughter inside?
- Yes.

508
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,192
Let me speak to the president.

509
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,510
I've been trying to get through to him.

510
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:12,910
<i>I'm sorry. You're gonna have to clear the area. </i>

511
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:17,558
<i> Jack, don't go in there alone. </i>

512
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:21,519
<i> Jack, talk to me. </i>
<i>The air strike's already been ordered. </i>

513
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,795
<i>Get out of there. </i>

514
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:55,232
