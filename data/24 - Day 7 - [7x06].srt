1
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:16,190
Without you, sangala has no leader.

2
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,690
These people, they work
for duba, don't they?

3
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:23,020
Mr. Matobo, we've accessed the
air intake to your safe room.

4
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:25,440
We are feeding in
ammonium dysterate gas.

5
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,270
- If yyou will die.
- Ule...

6
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:36,770
get him out of there!
Get the woman, too.

7
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,340
- Mr. Taylor.
- Sam.

8
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:39,480
I can't stay long.

9
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:42,230
They killed roger and made
it look like a suicide.

10
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:44,090
Who are they?

11
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,040
I don't know who they are.

12
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:47,250
They just said that they would
kill me if I said anything.

13
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:50,570
Roger was tasked witauditing
the brokers in his department.

14
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:51,970
It's all here.

15
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:55,350
Account numbers, trading
records, everything that he knew.

16
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:59,090
Roger was looking into
things he shouldn't have.

17
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,660
You killed my son.

18
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:05,830
It's tetradyzine, sir.

19
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:08,670
It's a neuromuscular paralytic.

20
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:13,200
The situation here is in control.
Are you tracking ms. Roth?

21
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:14,500
Yeah.

22
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:16,730
Time to get her back to her apartment.

23
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,030
Ms.Roth. henry taylor sent me.

24
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,420
Mr. Taylor's been looking
into the matter you discussed.

25
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:25,100
He believes you're in imminent danger.

26
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:28,070
He wants me to place you
in protective custody.

27
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:31,470
Larry, it's renee.

28
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:33,900
I've got a visual on them loading
matobo and his wife into a truck.

29
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,090
Where the hell is swat?

30
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:36,160
They're still about five minutes out.

31
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:37,480
Drop the gun.

32
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:39,900
Far as I can tell, she's alone.

33
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:42,420
Damn you, bauer, you son of a bitch.

34
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,300
Nichols wants her out of the
way before we deliver matobo.

35
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:49,220
- Come on.
- Yeah.

36
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:50,880
Turn around.

37
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:54,340
Trust mei'll get you through this alive.

38
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:09,810
*********

39
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:14,120
I want three more teams combing
the site where matobo was abducted.

40
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:15,860
Pull them in from
regional if you have to.

41
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:16,900
We're going to expand the search.

42
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:20,950
Coordinate with metro police to set up a
point-by-point grid encompassing a ten-mile radius.

43
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:21,900
And talk with nsa.

44
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,920
I want to back all of this up
with synchronized satellite sweeps.

45
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:25,830
I'll do what I can.

46
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,520
What does that mean?

47
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,250
Well, every time I ask for something,
they pull their cloak-and-dagger nonsense.

48
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:32,110
I have to get approval for
every little scrap of data.

49
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:35,460
Janis, this isn't easy for anybody.
Just, please, make it happen.

50
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:37,440
Yes, sir.

51
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,400
We know that another
attack could be imminent.

52
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:45,760
The only way to stop it is to find almeida
and bauer and take control of the cip deve.

53
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:56,240
for those of you who haven't heard,
renee walker was abducted by these people.

54
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:02,880
We're the only chance she's got.

55
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:06,860
So, let's get to work.

56
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,880
What have you got?

57
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:14,530
- Audio forensics cleaned up the recording.
- Okay.

58
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:17,530
Walker is extraneous.

59
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,680
Kill her before you get here.

60
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,790
Okay, we'll be with you soon.

61
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,170
Be quick about it. Dubaku's anxious
to get his hands on the prime minister.

62
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,460
Been combing through it, looking for
a tag that will give up their location.

63
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,300
So far, nothing.

64
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,530
Is there anybody else
you can put on this?

65
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:32,600
Larry, I don't think it's worth it.

66
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:33,520
There's nothing here.

67
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,380
All righ fine, help
janis coordinate with nsa.

68
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:38,140
I'm sorry about renee,
larry. She was a good agent.

69
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:41,510
We don't know that she's dead yet!

70
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:44,490
All right?

71
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:11,760
Are you sure thiss it?

72
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:15,440
- She's going to run out of air.
- Tony said near the backhoe.

73
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:17,800
Here, here.

74
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,450
I got her, chloe. I got her.

75
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,390
Alright, herehe is. Here she is.

76
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:37,130
She's not breathing.
Give me the adrenaline.

77
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:09,050
It's all right. You're
okay... you're okay.

78
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:11,870
Who are you?

79
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,300
We're working with jack.

80
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:16,080
He told us where to find you.

81
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:19,080
It's gonna be okay. Take deep breaths.

82
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,670
You're gonna be okay.

83
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:33,060
We're close to the rendezvous
point. What's your eta?

84
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:40,350
Good. We'll see you then.

85
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:51,310
It's all set.

86
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,430
Nichols is on his way with the diamonds.

87
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,430
is somethi bothering you, jack?

88
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:05,950
No, I was wondering...

89
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:09,340
why you never told tony
how you got him out of ctu.

90
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:15,850
How did you do it?

91
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,330
Christopher anderson.

92
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:23,090
Christopher anderson tried to kill him.

93
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:26,840
Anderson had nintention of killing tony.

94
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:30,550
He purposely missed the
artery when he injected him.

95
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:33,560
It was just enough to slow his heart to the
point where you'd think that he was dead.

96
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:35,850
My job was to...

97
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:39,190
extract and revive him and...

98
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,800
use him against you.

99
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:45,080
And?

100
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:50,540
By the time I stabilized him, you had
already killed anderson. Mission had failed.

101
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,580
So, my team went dark.

102
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:55,620
Why did he juslet tony go?

103
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:59,130
Tony chose to stay with us.

104
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:07,820
He was consumed with hatred and anger over
what the government had done to michelle.

105
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:15,950
Anyway... I talked to him.

106
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,270
More importantly, I listened to him.

107
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:27,970
Pretty soon, we came to
realize that... I was right.

108
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,410
About what?

109
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:34,530
That the rules had changed.

110
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:41,130
And there was nothing
such as honor left.

111
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:48,460
That we would have to
take care of each other.

112
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:53,960
Like brothers.

113
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:55,790
Mr. Emerson.

114
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,900
Yeah?

115
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,960
We're almost there.

116
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:02,390
How is the deal gonna go down?

117
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,130
Don't worry, jack.
You're about to find out.

118
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,720
Are you ready?

119
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:25,650
Yeah.

120
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:27,330
Are you sure?

121
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,740
Yeah.

122
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,000
Go help litvak with the door.

123
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,160
- Go get the matobos.
- Yeah.

124
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:14,600
you better tell me what
the hell's going on.

125
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:16,320
Drop the gun, david.

126
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:18,500
You know, I just couldn't
figure out your play,

127
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:21,560
so I tried to give you some
time so you'd come clean,

128
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:23,750
'cause we are like
brothers, right, tony?

129
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:25,150
Put the gun downdaviD.

130
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:28,430
You actually think that I would let
you steal those diamonds from me?

131
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,300
It's not about the diamonds.

132
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,960
It's about killing innocent people.

133
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,830
I can't let you finish this.

134
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,230
Take a shot.

135
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,210
Put down the weapon or I will kill him.

136
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,570
- Tony, take a shot!
- Shut up, jack!

137
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,700
- Put it down, tony, or he's dead.
- David, I don't want to kill you, but I will.

138
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:43,950
Damn it, tony, drop the...

139
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,940
- you okay?
- Yeah.

140
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,210
David.

141
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:15,150
Okay, you say that bauer and
almeida are working undercover,

142
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:17,410
but ctu has been shut down, so, I mean,

143
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,030
if you're telling the truth,
who's running this operation?

144
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:22,670
We are. We're not
working with any agency.

145
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:27,930
We believe there's been widespread infiltration
of the government by dubaku and the juma regime.

146
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,590
Okay. I need to contact my boss.

147
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,060
- He needs to know that I'm okay.
- You can't do that.

148
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:37,000
- Why not?
- Dubaku has informants in the fbi.

149
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:40,090
If they find out you're alive, they'll
know jack is working against them.

150
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:42,990
You don't know who you can trust.

151
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:44,190
I can trust agent moss.

152
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:47,470
You're not listening to me.
You cannot contact the fbi.

153
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:50,440
You will jeopardize this operation,
and I won't let you do that.

154
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,970
Well, I don't work for you; I work
for larry. Now give me a phone.

155
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:55,740
Sit still, please.

156
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,310
We're nearing the endgame.

157
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:03,370
Dubaku is the key to finding out who
in the government has been corrupted.

158
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,910
Luckily, we have something he wants.

159
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,790
Matobo.

160
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:13,420
He's our best chance to locate
dubaku, reacquire the cip module

161
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,310
and get to the bottom of
the government corruption.

162
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:18,860
Until all that happens,
you have to stay dead.

163
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:22,810
- yeah.
- Did you find agent walker?

164
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:25,140
Yeah, we got her, jack.
She's fine. Where are you?

165
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:28,670
Northwoods airfield. Litvak is dead.
Emerson's been wounded. Nichols is en route.

166
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,530
I need you to get over here now.

167
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:32,070
- Have you talked to matobo?
- Not yet.

168
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,650
He needs to agree to this,
jack. We can't do it without him.

169
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:37,270
I'll get him to agree.
Just get over here.

170
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:47,730
it's all right.

171
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,340
What the hell is going on?

172
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:54,620
Mr. Matobo, I'm not going
to hurt you or your wife.

173
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:58,380
I know how scared you are and I know what
you've been through, but we are here to help you.

174
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:01,120
What in god's name are you
talking about? You kidnapped us.

175
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:03,250
We had to to gain dubaku's trust.

176
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,730
That's the man we're after.
We're trying to stop him.

177
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:08,440
I want to call my people.

178
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:11,240
I can't let you do that,
not until you hear me out.

179
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:14,490
Sir, we have a plan to stop dubaku,
but we can't do it without your help.

180
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:16,410
We don't have much time.

181
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,170
Please. Come with me.

182
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,580
Mr. Dubaku.

183
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:29,580
I'm heading to the meeting place.
They're bringing matobo now.

184
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:31,830
- And his wife?
- Both of them.

185
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,250
Once you have matobo,
you know what to do.

186
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:37,920
Emerson's team is now
a loose end. Tie it off.

187
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:40,100
Are you sure about this?

188
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:43,150
We may need their services again.

189
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:49,000
I would rather keep my diamonds, and
almeida has proved to be a liability.

190
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:54,080
So. Any response from the white house?

191
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:55,700
Not the one we wanted.

192
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:58,550
American forces are still in position.

193
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,950
President taylor must
know we have matobo.

194
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:03,440
She can't attack sangala without him.

195
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:05,680
The country will collapse.

196
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:10,300
Taylor may be holding out hope that
she can somehow retrieve matobo.

197
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:14,170
Or she doesn't believe we are
willing to carry out our threats.

198
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:18,270
She will only respond when
there are dead americans.

199
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,940
I'll call you when I have matobo.

200
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:22,940
These gentlemen are at your command.

201
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:31,770
There are still 1,300 planes in the air.

202
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,890
Which region do you want targeted?

203
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:38,830
Washington, dc.

204
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,940
Yeah. Yeah.

205
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,640
I understand, bob.

206
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:03,970
All right, thanks.

207
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,920
That was bob cornell at nsa.

208
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:09,250
They've detected
another firewall breach.

209
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:10,420
There's been another attack?

210
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:13,940
Not yet, but they believe the
cip device is being utilized.

211
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:17,610
We have to assume dubaku is
initiating another attack.

212
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,270
It's safe to say this won't
be another warning shot.

213
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:23,450
This time dubaku's gonna
make sure that people die.

214
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:30,970
I want to speak personally with all
first responders across the country.

215
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,640
They need to know to brace for the worst
and that they have our full support.

216
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:40,230
Instead of preparing for it, maybe we should be
trying to preempt this attack, madam president.

217
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:45,620
The deadline dubaku gave us for withdrawing
our troops from sangala has passed,

218
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:48,270
but if we made some kind of gesture...

219
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:52,350
began an immediate pullback, it might
keep dubaku from pulling the trigger.

220
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:55,450
We've discussed this,
ethan. It's not an option.

221
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:57,810
I won't be dictated to by this madman.

222
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:01,810
Madam president, we can't
invade sangala without matobo,

223
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:05,330
and there's very little
chance of him being recovered.

224
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:07,440
Why are we risking american lives?

225
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:10,110
I've told you my reasons.

226
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:14,890
I implore you: Withdraw our
forces before it's too late.

227
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:19,540
You asked me to be your advisor
because you trust my opinion.

228
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:21,710
Well, I'm giving it to you now.

229
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:24,560
- We're out of options.
- We're not, ethan.

230
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:29,830
The nsa is attempting to localize what part
of the infrastructure is being targeted,

231
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:34,340
and the fbi is still trying
to track down the cip device.

232
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:41,280
I'll keep an open channel
with both agencies.

233
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:43,600
- I'll keep you apprised.
- Good.

234
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,650
Let me see it. Let me see it!

235
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,830
This wasn't about the diamonds, david.

236
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:07,070
You crossed a line I
wasn't willing to cross.

237
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:10,930
I'm sorry.

238
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:13,770
You're looking for forgiveness...

239
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:18,150
go to hell.

240
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,490
You... live with it.

241
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:32,310
You're asking us to risk our lives
to be delivered into dubaku's hands,

242
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,580
based on nothing but
what you have told us.

243
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,170
Everything I have told you is the truth.

244
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:39,010
Dubaku is in this country,
and we need to find him.

245
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:40,460
You have as much at stake as we do.

246
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:42,360
He's attacked both our countries.

247
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:44,310
Listen to him, ule.

248
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:48,750
You told me yourself president taylor
will not commit forces to sangala

249
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,070
until these attacks are stopped.

250
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:53,310
But how can we trust this man?

251
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:56,080
Because he has no reason to lie.

252
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:07,280
I will do what you ask,
but I will go alone.

253
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:09,560
Dubaku wants you and your
wife. That's the deal.

254
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:13,140
No. I will not put my wife
in the hands of that monster.

255
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:15,920
I will be honest with you, sir.
He wants your wife as leverage.

256
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:18,710
If I don't deliver both
of you, he will back out.

257
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:19,950
Leverage.

258
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:23,850
You mean he wants to torture her to make me tell
him what I know about the resiance in sangala?

259
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:27,820
Yes, sir. And we won't let that
happen. We'll be following you.

260
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:31,460
Still, you can't promise me that
she won't be harmed, can you?

261
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:34,780
Can you?

262
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,870
I won't do it.

263
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,800
May I speak with my husband?

264
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:44,850
Of course, ma'am.

265
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:49,650
- I want to do this, ule.
- What?

266
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:53,230
I am ashamed that I opened
the door to the safe room.

267
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,260
I want to do what is
right for our country.

268
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:57,670
Absolutely not.

269
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:00,200
You can't stop me, ule.

270
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:03,340
Sangala is my country, too.

271
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:07,510
I have been by your side for 22 years.

272
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:10,670
I am not going to leave it now.

273
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,690
Mr. Bauer.

274
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,940
We will do this together.

275
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:31,330
Thank you.

276
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:33,760
You are both very brave.

277
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:36,810
We'll need to go soon.
Excuse me for one moment.

278
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:48,260
Tony.

279
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:51,100
The matobos are gonna work
with us. We've got to go.

280
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:59,380
Tony.

281
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:11,700
Let's get the bodies out of sight.

282
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,560
We're locked onto the faa node.

283
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:25,180
Begin rerouting the targets.

284
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:31,570
Rsa 471, turn right, heading 274.

285
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:35,020
Descend and maintain flight level 270.

286
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,070
Call the white house.

287
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:47,160
The latest report from the nsa.

288
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:49,710
- I can summarize it for you.
- Go ahead.

289
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:53,380
They'vhad no luck in
localizing the firewall breach.

290
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:55,870
Dubaku's attack could hit anywhere.

291
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:58,170
What about the fbi?

292
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:03,650
they've dedicated every available
agent to the manhunt for matobo.

293
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,440
They're no closer to finding him.

294
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:07,180
Uh, excuse me.

295
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:12,130
We're at a deaend, madam president.

296
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:15,400
You need to order the pullback,
and you need to order it now.

297
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:17,040
Can it be traced?

298
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:19,980
Okay. Hold on.

299
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,200
Madam president.

300
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,410
What is it, tim?

301
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,890
I've just been forwarded
a scrambled call.

302
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,560
It's from colonel dubaku.

303
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:28,830
He's demanding to speak with you.

304
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:34,910
I'll take it.

305
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,240
This is president taylor.

306
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:43,140
Madam president...

307
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:46,930
I'm disappointed that you have
not taken my demands seriously.

308
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:50,130
Your forces are still in
position near my country.

309
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:55,520
Colonel dubaku,i assure you we've had very
serious discussions regarding your demands.

310
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:57,940
The time for discussions is over.

311
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:02,510
The deadline for your forces to
begin their withdrawal has passed.

312
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:04,740
Go to the window.

313
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:07,460
Look to the southwest,madam president.

314
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,410
What?

315
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:11,650
See what you have done.

316
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:15,400
Colonel dubaku,if you're
endangering one american life...

317
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:16,540
oh,my god.

318
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:19,770
Go,madam president.

319
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:31,090
You son of a bitch.

320
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:33,340
Comply with my demands within the hour,

321
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:36,980
or 10,000 more americans will die.

322
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,160
Is the cabinet still assembled?

323
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,480
Yes,madam president.

324
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:43,420
Was flight 131 out of chicago.

325
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:46,280
240 passengers,ten crew members.

326
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:49,310
They collided with a small
commuter jet carrying 21 people.

327
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:52,720
There's also a high probability
of casualties on the ground.

328
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:56,760
The aircraft went down in a residential
neighborhood near edgeborough.

329
00:22:58,330 --> 00:22:59,750
Thank you.

330
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:11,080
we've also just gotten word that congressman
brighten and his wife may have been on 131.

331
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:12,160
We're waiting for confirmation.

332
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:14,200
How many planes are still in the air?

333
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:16,440
Over 1,300.

334
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:19,980
Madam president,this is a
catastrophic loss of american lives,

335
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:20,750
and it's only going to get worse.

336
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:23,210
We have to withdraw our forces
before the next deadline.

337
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:25,400
I'm forced to agree,madam president.

338
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,650
Go ahead,tim.I want
to hear what you think.

339
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:40,730
We're simply not prepared to contend with
the scope of damage these people can inflict.

340
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:43,600
The tragedy we've just witnessed is
nothing compared to what could happen

341
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:46,220
if they begin targeting
more sensitive installations:

342
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:49,070
Power grids,nuclear facilities.

343
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,950
We're talking deaths in
the hundreds of thousands.

344
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:55,520
All in support of a policy that
cannot possibly succeed without matobo.

345
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:57,380
He's the only man who
can stabilize sangala.

346
00:23:57,390 --> 00:24:00,770
Without him,the entire
operation is pointless.

347
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:16,580
There's still a chance that prime
minister matobo will be recovered.

348
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:20,830
And while that chance
exists,I'm not giving in.

349
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:25,250
Admiral smith,your strike force will remain
in position and at full battle readiness.

350
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,260
Yes,madam president.

351
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:29,010
Madam president,you're guaranteeing
another attack on our country.

352
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:32,810
We will not be blackmailed,joe,and
we will not be held hostage.

353
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:35,000
This country does not
negotiate with terrorists.

354
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:37,610
Tell that to the families of the dead!

355
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,350
Do you have any idea what
the public reaction will be

356
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,600
when word gets out that
these are acts of terrorism?

357
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:43,230
Brought about by your
reckless foreign policy?

358
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,650
I can guarantee there will be
a call for your impeachment...

359
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:47,940
- that's enough,joe.
- I will not stand by and let this happen.

360
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:51,800
Then you can turn in your
resignation,joe,because I'm not changing my mind.

361
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:56,400
Now sit down or leave.

362
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,030
I'm sorry,madam president.

363
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:14,070
You people think about
what you're doing here...

364
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:17,510
about the cost you're willing to pay.

365
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:42,040
Gentlemen,ladies...

366
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:48,840
I know that there are many of you
here who agree with secretary stevens.

367
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:53,440
If I can't alleviate your doubts,

368
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:57,410
I can at least help you
to understand my reasoning.

369
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:05,660
When I took the oath of office,I swore
to myself,and to the american people,

370
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:10,620
that this country would continue to
be a force for good in this world.

371
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:14,490
We're a nation founded on ideals,

372
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:19,410
and those ideals are
being challenged today.

373
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:28,470
Now how we respond will not only define
this administration,but an entire generation.

374
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:33,560
And not just americans,but sangalans,

375
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:38,750
and anyone else who looks to
us for guidance and strength.

376
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:43,800
I won't fail them...

377
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:48,210
and neither will you.

378
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:57,840
we're in for some tough times ahead.

379
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:01,040
Let's make sure we're ready.

380
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:12,080
Thank you,everyone.

381
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:09,040
- Hey,jack.
- They're over there.

382
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:11,470
I want you to put a wire on
mr. Matobo as fast as you can.

383
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,560
Go.

384
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,040
You okay?

385
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,070
What do you think,jack?

386
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:25,530
You shot me and buried me alive.

387
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:27,970
If we hadn't,emerson
would have killed you.

388
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:30,340
I'm sorry we had to keep you in the
dark,but we didn't have a choice.

389
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:31,910
Yes,you did.

390
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,430
You could have trusted me.

391
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:38,390
If I had told you everything back at
the fbi,would you have believed me?

392
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:55,980
Have a seat,please,sir.

393
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:10,490
What's that?

394
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,960
It's a transmitter.I'll be
affixing it to one of your teeth.

395
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:17,700
We'll know exactly where
you are at all times.

396
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:19,350
You won't be alone.

397
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:21,300
Are you with the fbi?

398
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:23,760
No,I'm a
stay-at-home mom.

399
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:25,460
Open your mouth,please.

400
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:29,190
Wider.Good.

401
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,560
Chloe acssed the fbi server.

402
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:34,730
Dubaku brought down two planes
just outside the capital.

403
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:37,210
Over 270 people were killed.

404
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:39,730
He's threatened to kill 10,000 more.

405
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:41,160
We have less than an hour to stop it.

406
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:43,060
- How long before nichols gets here?
- Ten minutes.

407
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:44,520
Here's your com.

408
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:45,830
Thanks.

409
00:29:56,650 --> 00:29:58,200
You all right?

410
00:29:58,210 --> 00:29:59,540
Yeah,just a little dizzy.

411
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,530
- You should take a seat.
- I'm fine.

412
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:03,940
Hey,come on.

413
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:05,730
Take a seat.

414
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:11,050
So it's really true?

415
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:12,810
Yeah.

416
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,570
I've devoted my life to the bureau
and you just expect me to believe

417
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:18,350
that it's corrupted--that the
entire government's been corrupted?

418
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,850
Not all of them.

419
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:22,550
But until we find out
who,we can't trust anyone.

420
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:25,360
And the four of you really
think you can stop this?

421
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:26,660
We have to.

422
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:28,820
It's as simple as that.

423
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:35,150
Ethan...

424
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:37,070
can we...

425
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:42,440
The president is
completely alone on this,

426
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:44,830
and she's going to get a
lot of americans killed.

427
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,660
You've got to find a way
to talk some sense into her.

428
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:49,650
We're both on the same side here,tim.

429
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:52,560
And I'm going to need your help
if we're going to change her mind.

430
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:54,550
How do you propose we do that?

431
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:57,310
There is someone she'll listen to.

432
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:00,500
Maybe we can convince him to help us.

433
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,320
- go ahead.
- I just dropped her off.

434
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:56,020
She's on her way up.

435
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,050
Okay,stay in the car and keep watch.

436
00:31:58,060 --> 00:31:59,690
I'll call you when it's done.

437
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:56,360
mr. Taylor,how did you get in here?

438
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:03,930
the agent you sent just brought me
by to get a few of my things for...

439
00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:11,530
mr. Taylor,are you all right?

440
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:17,480
Mr. Taylor,are you okay?

441
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:25,450
Mr. Taylor,unless you tell me
what's wrong,I don't know what...

442
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:33,160
help me.

443
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:34,730
help me.Please.

444
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:00,090
yes,mr. Kanin.

445
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:02,390
Agent gedge,I'm looking
for henry taylor.

446
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,650
He's not answering his
phone.Is he with you?

447
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:07,030
You can't talk with him right now,sir.

448
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,920
Why not?Where is he?

449
00:34:08,930 --> 00:34:11,810
Well,he's meeting with samantha
roth in her apartment,sir.

450
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:14,240
For what possible reason?

451
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:16,230
I don't know,sir.He didn't tell me.

452
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,800
Why aren't you with him?

453
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:21,100
Mr. Taylor insisted on
meeting with her alone,sir.

454
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:23,690
I'm in the car.I'm just
outside the building.

455
00:34:23,970 --> 00:34:25,720
I don't give a damn what he insisted.

456
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,180
We went through this,agent gedge.

457
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:29,280
You were supposed to
keep him away from her.

458
00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:30,650
What the hell were you thinking?

459
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:32,060
I'm sorry,sir.

460
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,600
I'm not interested in your apology.

461
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:37,120
Just pull him out of there and have
him phone me as soon as possible.

462
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:08,960
Don't try to speak,sir.

463
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:11,900
There's nothing left to say.

464
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:44,400
We will wait here.

465
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:46,870
All right.

466
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,660
They're coming.One car
from the service road.

467
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:57,940
How many peopl

468
00:35:57,950 --> 00:35:59,590
I can't tell.The windows are tinted.

469
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,120
Copy that.

470
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:28,040
How are you doing,tony?

471
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:30,550
All right.

472
00:36:31,610 --> 00:36:33,790
I was glad to hear you're still with us.

473
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:36,520
Where's emerson?

474
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:38,870
You're not going to be
dealing with him today.

475
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,830
What do you mean?

476
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:42,410
He's dead.

477
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:44,850
So's litvak and bauer.

478
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:47,490
I got them in a back
room.You want to say hi?

479
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:51,180
You better start telling me
what the hell is going on.

480
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:55,660
I decided I'd rather not split the cut.

481
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:59,310
I don't understand.I thought
you and emerson were friends

482
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:02,810
yeah,that was before he
left me to rot with the fbi.

483
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:09,340
You want matobo or not?

484
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:11,020
- Where is he?
- Close.

485
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:14,390
I want to see him,and his wife.

486
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,160
Diamonds.

487
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,290
Matobo.

488
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:54,270
He's in the back of the truck.

489
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:12,950
Keep your tracks clean.

490
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,450
We might call on you again.

491
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:40,870

492
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,590
Let's put that behind us.

493
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:48,140
You got what you want.

494
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,330
Now,get the hell out of here.

495
00:38:50,810 --> 00:38:52,630

498
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:38,410
Get everyone ready to move out.

499
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:13,910
Gedge...

500
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:38,260
gedge.

501
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,910
Don't do this.

502
00:40:57,070 --> 00:40:58,590
Please...

503
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:10,260
the white house still has not complied.

504
00:42:10,270 --> 00:42:12,850
American force are still in position.

505
00:42:13,270 --> 00:42:17,520
I think this president is not
just stubborn; she's insane.

506
00:42:17,530 --> 00:42:19,290
What do you intend to do?

507
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:20,740
Exactly what we promised.

508
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:22,690
