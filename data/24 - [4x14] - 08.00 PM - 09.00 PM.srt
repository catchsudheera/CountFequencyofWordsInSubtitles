1
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:19,395
We know you printed a document
before the EMP detonated. Where is it?

2
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,869
You decide when the pain stops.

3
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,398
Drop your gun or I'll kill him.

4
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,997
Paul, where's the data printout?

5
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,354
I hid it.

6
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:35,079
- Is this it?
- Yeah. It's in code.

7
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,718
I couldn't make any sense out of it.

8
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,358
We need to get it back to CTU.

9
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,155
I appreciate you carrying the ball
until Michelle got here.

10
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,754
Why don't you
bring everyone up to speed?

11
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,877
The man responsible
for planning today's attacks, Habib Marwan,

12
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,554
has been a long-term employee
of McLennan-Forster.

13
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,712
Jack and Paul Raines
went to inspect his computer files.

14
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,678
As they were doing so,
an EMP bomb was detonated,

15
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,637
wiping out the company's database.

16
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,188
We have to assume
whoever detonated the EMP

17
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,874
wants Jack and Paul eliminated.

18
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,237
- Why are we going here?
- Weapons and ammunition.

19
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,798
Get out of here!
The next one won't miss.

20
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,792
I'm a federal agent. Look, we need your help.

21
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:14,995
Who's after you?

22
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,196
It has to do with the terrorist attacks.

23
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,555
I have evidence
that I need to get to the authorities.

24
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:23,189
<i> If you're fighting the people who</i>
<i>caused today's bloodshed, we'll help you. </i>

25
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,638
<i> It's time. </i>

26
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,196
- Jack!
- I'm here.

27
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,191
- You safe?
- Yeah.

28
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,590
I need you to get this to CTU.
It needs to get decoded immediately.

29
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,509
Jack, look out!

30
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:53,839
Paul? Paul! Get me a medic.

31
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,191
<i> It's time for you to go. </i>
<i>Are you ready?</i>

32
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,919
Yes, of course.

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,551
Proceed as planned. The President
of the United States is on a tight schedule.

34
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,358
We can't be late.

35
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:24,069
He's bleeding out. Tell 'em
we need two litres of A-positive haemo.

36
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,639
Roger that.

37
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:29,872
Come on, Paul.
Stay with us. We're almost there.

38
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,398
- Hello.
- <i>Audrey, it's me. </i>

39
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,153
Oh, Jack. Thank God you're all right.

40
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:48,518
Audrey, I need you to listen to me.
Paul's been shot.

41
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,878
<i>Audrey?</i>

42
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,199
<i>Audrey?</i>

43
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,349
How bad is it?

44
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,991
The medics are working on him.
We'll be there in a few minutes.

45
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,798
Jack, how did this happen?

46
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,678
One of the gunmen tried to shoot me.

47
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,274
Paul pushed me out of the way.

48
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,555
<i>He saved my life. </i>

49
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,148
Audrey?

50
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,793
I'm here. I just...

51
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:26,793
- Jack, I don't know what to say.
- You don't have to say anything.

52
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,998
Surgeons are standing by.
We're gonna do everything that we have to.

53
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,516
- <i>You understand that?</i>
- Yeah, I understand.

54
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,350
I'm sorry.

55
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,668
I gotta go.

56
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,035
- See you in a minute.
- Yeah. OK.

57
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:56,830
Mr President, all the evidence we've gathered
confirms that this one man, Habib Marwan,

58
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,718
is responsible for everything
that's happened today.

59
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:04,555
The train derailment, my abduction,
the sabotage of our nuclear power plants.

60
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,313
Does evidence suggest
he is planning more attacks?

61
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:12,599
I'm afraid so. NSA is reporting a spike in
chatter. They're sifting through the intel now,

62
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,990
trying to determine
potential targets and time frames.

63
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:19,550
- Trying is not good enough.
The chopper is about to land.

64
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,631
We need to pre-empt further attacks.

65
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,918
I understand, sir. Our best chance
of doing that is by capturing Marwan.

66
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,037
- How close are you?
- Jack Bauer recovered a document

67
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,193
we believe contains contact data
on Marwan's network.

68
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,158
CTU is using it to track Marwan.

69
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,392
- And if that fails?
- <i>We just have to hope that it doesn't. </i>

70
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,198
Jim,

71
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,876
today's events are continuing
to generate an unprecedented level of fear.

72
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:52,476
I'm not sure the social and civil fabric
of this country can withstand another attack.

73
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,835
- <i>We need to make provisions. </i>
- Provisions?

74
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:59,391
The civil unrest that I believe is inevitable
in the event of another strike.

75
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,994
Are you saying
we should impose martial law?

76
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,834
General Wakefield will meet with you
in LA to discuss our options.

77
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,832
- When?
- Now. His plane landed.

78
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:12,515
He'll be calling you
to confirm a secure location.

79
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:17,390
- And, Jim, keep this between us.
- Of course, Mr President.

80
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,836
He's still falling.

81
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:52,914
He's losing pressure. I need ten
cc's of adrenaline, no compression. Let's go.

82
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,195
Paul. Paul, can you hear me?

83
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,350
- Paul.
- We gotta get him to surgery now.

84
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,034
- Paul.
- Let's go.

85
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,395
I'm sorry.

86
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,193
Please tell me he's not gonna die.

87
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,271
Come here.

88
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,677
Please.

89
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,273
Jack, tell me.

90
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,158
We don't know. We just don't know.

91
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,668
- Jack, are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

92
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:31,389
- We pulled a name off the list you sent us.
- Who is it?

93
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:34,552
Someone on our watch list.
We had no idea he was with Marwan.

94
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,712
Come on inside. We'll talk you through it.

95
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,710
You need to stay out here
while your husband's prepped for surgery.

96
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,189
Please, can I just talk to him for a second?

97
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,078
Paul, hey. Hey, it's Audrey.

98
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,355
Listen to me.

99
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:57,153
I just want you to know
that I'm here, OK? I'm here.

100
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,236
We need to prep him now.
- I will be here when you get out of surgery.

101
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,356
Paul?

102
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,318
Get him prepped and ready.

103
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:19,639
Joseph Fayed, professor
at Green University, chemical engineering.

104
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,995
Came to the US in 1985.

105
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,640
We're sending in a tactical team
to pick him up.

106
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,233
- That's a mistake.
- Why?

107
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:31,075
Marwan's vetted his inner circle carefully.
That man'll die before he says anything.

108
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:36,029
You're probably right, Jack,
but what can we do besides arrest Fayed?

109
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,908
Send someone in undercover.
They might lead you to Marwan.

110
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,958
We don't have time to put
one of our people undercover.

111
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:46,555
I'm not talking about one of our people.
Dina Araz.

112
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:50,394
We've granted her son immunity.
We have nothing left to offer her.

113
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,597
Maybe not. I'll talk to her
while you mobilise a tactical team.

114
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,194
If I can't get her to cooperate, send them in.

115
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:02,276
It's simple - we either find Marwan, or we will
not be able to stop what he's planning next.

116
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:21,478
Meet them at the hotel, Old River Road,
half a kilometre from the base.

117
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,676
- When?
- Leave now.

118
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:28,072
I'll need his flight package,
including clearance and identification codes.

119
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,391
You'll have whatever you need.

120
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,395
Is that all you've got?

121
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:52,713
- For now it is.
- Come on, I haven't seen you in two weeks.

122
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:57,191
Yeah, I've gotta get to the base.
I'm flying tonight.

123
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,874
Damn. I'm gonna be late as it is.

124
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,909
- Oh, look at me. I'm all wrinkled.
- I wouldn't worry about that.

125
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,748
Hello.

126
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,149
<i> I need to talk to John. </i>

127
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,993
- It's for you.
- What?

128
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,828
It's your wife.

129
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,514
But it's your cellphone.

130
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,673
Laurie.

131
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,639
They say they'll kill the children
unless you do what they want.

132
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,712
- What's going on, Laurie? Who's there?
- I don't know.

133
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,315
Listen to me, Laurie.
Whoever's there, you put them on the phone.

134
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,630
Please don't let them hurt the children.

135
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,948
<i>Laurie. </i>

136
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,031
Laurie, put...

137
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,714
Put your clothes on, John.

138
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:11,876
Curtis is prepping the tactical teams, which
means you have five minutes to do this.

139
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,752
Do you recognise this man?

140
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,673
- No.
- He's connected to Marwan.

141
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,713
I don't know him.
I already told the other agent.

142
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,679
Marwan doesn't permit
communication between cells.

143
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:45,834
His name is Joseph Fayed.
He's a professor at Green University.

144
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,878
You know more about him than I do.

145
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:53,395
He's also our only way to reach Marwan.

146
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,313
We can't do that without your help.

147
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,709
Why should I help you?

148
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:03,430
I've already gotten
all I'm going to get for cooperating.

149
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,833
That's not necessarily true.

150
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,393
I know you love your son.

151
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,996
You've already shown me that today.

152
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,310
But unless you help us get to Fayed,

153
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:28,838
that'll be the last time you see him
for the rest of your life.

154
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,670
- Dessler.
- <i> The teams are in place. </i>

155
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,752
All right. Have them stand by.

156
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,592
Tactical teams are ready.
They can be at Fayed's house in ten minutes.

157
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,752
Let's give him another minute.

158
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:49,550
I'm offering you freedom. You and Behrooz
will go into a witness protection programme.

159
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,598
You'll be given new names,
identities, everything.

160
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,558
This is what you told me you wanted.

161
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,672
I'm offering you a life with your son.

162
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:05,551
Right now, the only question is
which life do you want?

163
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,588
We're out of time.

164
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,429
What do you need me to do?

165
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,074
I need you to go to Fayed, and tell him
that you need to speak to Marwan.

166
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,073
He won't let me through his front door,
let alone get near Marwan.

167
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,869
He will when you tell him
that you've got a hostage that can help him.

168
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:46,872
A hostage? Who?

169
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,236
Me.

170
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,115
So what's this all about? What are you doing?

171
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,829
- I'm delivering you to someone.
- Who?

172
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,388
- I don't know.
- You don't know who you work for?

173
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,677
- I work for myself.
- Somebody's paying you.

174
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:22,756
I don't ask them who they are,
and they don't tell me. That's how I stay alive.

175
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,710
All right. It's time.

176
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,233
If you don't cooperate, your family will die.

177
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,668
Do you understand?

178
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,514
It's all there. Get out of here.

179
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:15,198
Get your things. We've got a plane to catch.

180
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:19,429
Increased chatter indicates
Marwan is planning another strike.

181
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,592
It is imperative we locate him
before he triggers this.

182
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:27,913
We are mounting an undercover operation
to lead us to him through this man.

183
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,070
Joseph Fayed.

184
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:34,472
We've struck a deal with Dina Araz to
work undercover for us and approach Fayed.

185
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,235
- Marwan knows we have Araz in custody.
- We will use that to our advantage.

186
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,836
- Jack will run us through the cover story.
- The cover story goes as follows.

187
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:46,629
An hour ago, I was transporting Araz
to the federal detention centre.

188
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,349
My vehicle was attacked by members
of a terrorist cell run by Navi Araz

189
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,715
at the intersection of Sepulveda and National.

190
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,190
I managed to kill all of the attackers,
but during the engagement

191
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:59,795
Dina Araz secured one of the weapons
and took me hostage.

192
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,678
She'll take me to Fayed.
He'll take me to Marwan.

193
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:06,036
- Marwan takes the bait, we track you to him.
- Yeah.

194
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:10,671
They're gonna search both Jack and Dina,
which makes surveillance a problem.

195
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:15,436
We'll handle this passively. We'll use
satellite parabolics and laser aggregators.

196
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:18,910
You think Dina Araz'll be able
to play this convincingly?

197
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,357
She's lived in the United States
for five years while part of a terrorist cell.

198
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,908
Yes. She's an expert at deception.

199
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,150
As long as she doesn't deceive us.

200
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,391
This is our best
and only chance at finding Marwan.

201
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:36,076
No matter how well we fabricate this story,
Jack will be in extreme, immediate danger.

202
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:41,712
We have to be able to move in at the first sign
of trouble. There is zero tolerance for error.

203
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,000
- Thank you.
- Good luck, everyone.

204
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:52,833
Curtis, the detainees from McLennan-Forster
have been taken to Division.

205
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,036
- Run the interrogation.
- You got it.

206
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,951
Thank you.

207
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,838
Edgar, I want you to call LAPD and Caltrans.

208
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,559
Their logs need to reflect
that the ambush took place.

209
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,915
I need an exact time window.

210
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,719
He just finished telling us. An hour ago.

211
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,873
- I didn't know if there was an update.
- No, you weren't paying attention.

212
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:15,032
We can't afford for you
to lose focus at a time like this.

213
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,714
I'm sick of people saying
I don't know what I'm doing.

214
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:21,315
Especially people who
don't really work here.

215
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:28,038
Is there a problem with Edgar?

216
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:34,150
His mother was caught in a contamination
zone at San Gabriel. She took her own life.

217
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:38,358
Up till now he's been handling it well.
It might be catching up with him.

218
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:41,477
Do you think he can run
the comm part of this operation?

219
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:44,711
Based on what just happened? No.

220
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,350
I didn't see Chloe on the active roster.

221
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,796
- Yeah, well, Driscoll forced her to resign.
- Why?

222
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:55,668
Apparently, Chloe went against
Driscoll's orders, sided with Jack.

223
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:58,593
Turns out Jack was right.

224
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,671
Thank you.

225
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,394
Hello.

226
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:21,075
- Chloe. Michelle Dessler.
- Are you calling me from Division?

227
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:25,312
I'm back at CTU. Secretary Heller
asked me to take Erin Driscoll's place.

228
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,709
She got fired? That's too bad.

229
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,872
Tell Edgar to upgrade
the pattern-recognition software.

230
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,918
- He gets overwhelmed.
- I'll make sure he takes care of that.

231
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,753
- Thanks.
- <i>Listen, Chloe,</i>

232
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,912
<i>you're better at what you do</i>
<i>than anyone I've worked with. </i>

233
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,108
I need you here.

234
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,237
Thank you for saying that,
but I've had enough for today.

235
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,995
Chloe, this would be for Jack,
not just for CTU.

236
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:54,153
- What are you talking about?
- He's about to go into a high-risk operation.

237
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,152
<i>We need to mount massive</i>
<i>surveillance in little time. </i>

238
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,198
I'm not confident
that Edgar can do this on his own.

239
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:03,192
- Well, there's nothing I can do about that.
- Chloe,

240
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:07,193
I just need a few hours of your time,
and then you can move on.

241
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:11,956
I just wanna do everything I can
to ensure Jack's safety.

242
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,314
Fine. But it's just for today.

243
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:18,472
- Thank you, Chloe.
- You're welcome.

244
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,835
Set cars up at the ambush site
in case Marwan wants to verify.

245
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,514
Use dead bodies of terrorists
from Heller's rescue.

246
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:33,390
The follow team will stay as close as they
can, but you're flying without a net here.

247
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,233
If a hostile decides
to take you out without warning,

248
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,312
- there's nothing we can do.
- I know.

249
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:43,837
Audrey's still at the clinic.
There's time if you wanna say goodbye.

250
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,678
She's got a lot on her mind right now.

251
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:52,548
Jack, she should know
what you're about to do.

252
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,598
She's been through enough today.

253
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:11,794
Look over the time line.
We'll talk through the details.

254
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:16,158
I'm not doing anything until I see my son.

255
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:22,031
- We don't have time for that right now.
- Seeing my son is non-negotiable.

256
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,917
Tony.

257
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:36,115
Learn every aspect of the cover story.
Your life depends on it.

258
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,430
Don't worry about me.

259
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:49,159
You can see your son,
but only for a minute. That's all. Let's go.

260
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,635
Mom.

261
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,912
They wouldn't tell me where you were
or if I'd see you again.

262
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,389
We are going to be together.

263
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,840
What? They wouldn't let you come with me.

264
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:21,196
Everything has changed.
I agreed to do something for them,

265
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,158
and they'll let me go with you.

266
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,908
- What do they want you to do?
- Help them find Marwan.

267
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,515
- It's too dangerous.
- Oh, I can handle Marwan.

268
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:37,116
- Please, Mom, no.
- Don't worry. I'll be fine.

269
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,430
Please, Mom.

270
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,715
Mrs Araz, it's time.

271
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,913
- Is field surveillance in place?
- We have audio.

272
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,958
We should be able to hear inside the house.

273
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,918
That's assuming they get that far.

274
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,912
- OK. Thank you.
- Yeah.

275
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,797
Come on. Come on.

276
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:33,077
- Why aren't you going through?
Use a Danziger filter.

277
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:37,073
You can download it internally
if you know what you're doing. You're in.

278
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,515
- Why are you here?
- Michelle asked me to help.

279
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,991
- I'll cover your overflow.
- I can handle my assignment.

280
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,038
You can't, otherwise
Michelle wouldn't have called me in.

281
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,839
Edgar, I meant to tell you
before Chloe got here.

282
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,956
I can do my job. I don't need any help.

283
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,634
I'm not saying you can't,
but I'm not taking chances.

284
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:59,430
- I know we got off to a rocky start, but...
- Edgar, this isn't a debate. It's an order.

285
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,193
Brief Chloe so she can
run satellite with you.

286
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:05,750
Jack's approaching
the staging area now.

287
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:16,349
- Baron.
- Dessler. We're set on our end.

288
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,591
Teams are in place. Go in at your discretion.

289
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:23,355
Roger that. We'll leave this line open.

290
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,876
We are going in alone?

291
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,918
Our agents are conducting audio surveillance.

292
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,959
- What does that mean?
- Acknowledge that you can hear me.

293
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,713
Copy that.

294
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:02,598
- What are you doing?
- I have to make it look like I was injured.

295
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,238
Take my gun.

296
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,232
This has to look as convincing
as possible. Take my gun.

297
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:28,630
You must know that I want to kill you.

298
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,917
Yes, but you won't because of Behrooz.

299
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,391
Let's go.

300
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:45,635
- They're going in.
We're standing by.

301
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:02,196
- What if Fayed doesn't believe us?
- Then we're both dead.

302
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:05,909
<i>... people were evacuating</i>
<i>the San Gabriel Island area. </i>

303
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,549
<i>As you can see here</i>
<i>from footage that was shot earlier... </i>

304
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,749
<i>... people tried to evacuate. </i>

305
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,478
- Who is it?
- Joseph, it's Dina Araz.

306
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:29,199
- Who?
- Dina Araz. I'm a friend.

307
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,350
My husband is Navi. He's been killed.

308
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,635
I don't know what you're talking about.

309
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:37,793
- I need to speak to Marwan.
- I don't know any Marwan.

310
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:40,440
- Yes, you do.
- Go away before I call the police.

311
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:44,399
You won't call the police,
and we both know why.

312
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,998
- What do you want?
- I have a hostage.

313
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:54,029
Someone Marwan will want.
His name is Jack Bauer, he's a CTU agent.

314
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:57,396
Now, please let me in
before someone sees me.

315
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:09,033
Close the door.
Put your gun over there. Do it.

316
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,236
- How did you find me?
- My husband told me.

317
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:35,233
- I don't know your husband.
- He knew you.

318
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:40,075
- Tell me what happened.
- My husband was killed, and I was arrested.

319
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,435
They were transporting me to CTU.

320
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:46,479
I heard an explosion,
and the van we were driving crashed.

321
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:49,757
<i>It was our people. </i>
<i>They came to rescue me. </i>

322
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:56,393
<i>Everyone fell, except Bauer and me. He was</i>
<i>wounded, and I managed to get his gun. </i>

323
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,916
- <i> Where?</i>
- The intersection of Sepulveda and National.

324
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,230
Half a mile from here.

325
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:05,389
Don't move.

326
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,590
What is it?
- <i>This is Fayed. </i>

327
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,875
<i>A woman named Dina Araz came to me. </i>

328
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,270
- How did she find you?
- She claims her husband told her.

329
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,590
- <i>What does she want?</i>
- She has a hostage.

330
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:29,356
- <i>A CTU agent named Jack Bauer. </i>
- Jack Bauer?

331
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:37,269
- Can you break into the other side?
- No, the signal's scrambled.

332
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:42,271
Our people ambushed a vehicle
at the intersection of Sepulveda and National.

333
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,999
<i>Everyone was killed,</i>
<i>but she escaped with Bauer. </i>

334
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:47,674
<i>What do you want me to do?</i>

335
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,273
<i>Bring them to me. </i>

336
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:55,592
<i>I will call you back in five minutes</i>
<i>with the details. Be ready. </i>

337
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:58,752
- Do you understand?
- <i>Yes. </i>

338
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:02,115
I understand.

339
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,355
Marwan wants to see him.

340
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,830
- Baron, it's a go.
<i>- I heard. </i>

341
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:19,310
Set a follow grid.
We'll coordinate from our end.

342
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,189
- Evening, sir.
- Evening.

343
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,630
Pop the trunk for me, sir.

344
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,792
Since when are you searching
officers' cars at the gate?

345
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,075
Elevated threat level.

346
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,955
- OK. You're good to go, sir.
- Thank you.

347
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:17,510
- I'm on base.
- <i> Proceed as planned. </i>

348
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,149
- Let me talk to my family.
- Open the trunk.

349
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:26,552
- Let me talk to my wife.
- I said open the trunk.

350
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,995
Please. Let me talk to my family.

351
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:34,393
Your family is dead. And so are you.

352
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:24,119
Mrs Raines.

353
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:27,590
Your husband sustained bullet wounds
to his chest and abdomen.

354
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:31,229
We extracted one bullet,
but I called a neurosurgeon in from Cedars

355
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:34,756
- to help extract the second bullet.
- Why a neurosurgeon?

356
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:38,116
Well, the bullet is lodged
against his T5 vertebra,

357
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:41,158
and we want to avoid
any further spinal trauma.

358
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:44,312
I can't believe this is happening.

359
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:49,554
- I'll let you know as soon as I get any news.
Thank you.

360
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,114
Dad...

361
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:08,512
I don't think I realised
how much I care for Paul until now.

362
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:21,196
I know this is terrible timing, but
the president has called and I have to leave.

363
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:30,236
You'll be able to reach me on my number.
The doctors will keep me up to speed here.

364
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,318
OK.

365
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,789
I love you, Audrey.

366
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:38,599
And I'm proud to be your dad.

367
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,029
I love you, too.

368
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,957
Be careful.

369
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,753
- Where are you taking me?
- Shut up.

370
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,911
<i> How far are we going?</i>

371
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,195
<i> It won't be long. </i>

372
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:24,110
<i> You look nervous. </i>

373
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,951
What do you expect?

374
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:31,079
I wouldn't have contacted you
if I felt I had a choice.

375
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,754
And as a result, I have no choice.

376
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:38,516
We do whatever we have to for the cause.
So what's the problem?

377
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,875
There is no problem.

378
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,955
They're turning off Olympic.

379
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,998
Moving to the next subchannel.

380
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:51,071
He's turning onto a side street.

381
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:55,039
- <i>Collier Avenue. Hold that distance. </i>
- Understood.

382
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,633
He's heading towards the Broad Street tunnel.

383
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:06,712
He's slowing down. Baron, drop back.

384
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:09,553
- <i>We can't have him spot the tail. </i>
- We're backing off.

385
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:13,957
- <i>He's turning into the tunnel. </i>
- Maintain your distance.

386
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:22,915
<i> He's too far ahead. </i>
<i>We won't be able to hear what's going on. </i>

387
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,232
The tunnel is 400 yards long.
They'll be out of view for 20 seconds.

388
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:42,275
Pull in front of this truck.

389
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,948
- What's going on?
Get out of the car.

390
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:52,759
What are you doing?

391
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:01,114
- From Marwan.
- Yes.

392
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:20,720
This is taking too long.

393
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:25,634
- They're outta the tunnel.
- Do you have a visual?

394
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:28,792
That's it. We got him up ahead.

395
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,759
- Fayed's turning onto Napier.
- Napier loops back around to Olympic.

396
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:37,718
He just spent the last five minutes
driving in a circle.

397
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:41,031
Maybe he's trying to detect surveillance.

398
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:44,351
- Chloe, can you switch to infrared?
- Hold on.

399
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:52,109
- There's only one person in the car.
- They made a switch in the tunnel.

400
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:56,478
<i>The covert part of the operation is over. </i>
<i>All teams, move in on the target car. </i>

401
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,551
Alpha team, cut him off at the bridge.

402
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:01,632
Establish a perimeter.
Stop and search all vehicles.

403
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:05,110
- Anything on satellite?
- Nothing around the immediate area.

404
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,431
- Can you go back into archives?
- It'll take a few minutes.

405
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,636
- Do it.
- Baron, what's your status?

406
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,790
We're closing in now.

407
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:22,119
<i> We got him</i>
<i>surrounded on the bridge. I'll take the lead. </i>

408
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:26,951
- Passenger side.
- On the left.

409
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:30,274
Flank him.

410
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:35,309
- Get out of the car, and put your hands up.
Out of the car!

411
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,875
Bomb! Bomb! Bomb!

412
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,953
Oh, my God.

413
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:01,194
Marwan set us up.

414
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,751
- Almeida.
- <i>This is Alden. Baron's dead. </i>

415
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,910
So is Fayed. Is there any sign of Jack?

416
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,356
- No. Any other hostiles in the area?
- No, the area looks secure.

417
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,637
OK. I'll get you another backup team
as soon as I can.

418
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:33,917
- I have the archive satellite footage.
- Play it back.

419
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,232
OK. During the time Fayed's car
is in the tunnel, three vehicles exit.

420
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,915
- Check the van.
- Can you get me a licence number on that?

421
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,596
Not from the satellite. I'll check the traffic
cameras. Get me the Caltrans interface.

422
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:49,035
We have a socket open. Logging in.

423
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,996
Done.

424
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:58,315
OK, there's a camera
at the entrance to the tunnel.

425
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,039
Looking for the right frame.

426
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:09,917
Got it.

427
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,310
Send this out to all field teams.
I want support setting up the grid.

428
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,833
I'm on it.

429
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:18,230
We have an ID on a vehicle.
White Chevy van, late '90s,

430
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:21,471
licence plate - Charlie Victor Alpha 322.

431
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:31,036
Get up.

432
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,834
You've caused me a lot of trouble.

433
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,628
Sorry for your loss, Dina.

434
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,149
Navi was a great man.

435
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:13,829
I hope my men weren't too rough with you.
It was necessary,

436
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,115
in case you were under surveillance.

437
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,430
I understand.

438
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:21,796
But we weren't followed. I was careful.

439
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:26,392
- You're a good liar, Dina.
- What?

440
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:30,598
Fayed martyred himself.
The men who were following you are dead.

441
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:33,672
- What men?
- Enough with the lies.

442
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:39,394
Marwan, please believe me.

443
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,630
I did not betray you.

444
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,755
Prove it to me.

445
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,280
Kill him.

446
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,516
Just what I thought.

447
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:38,714
Get him out of here.

448
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:29,993
