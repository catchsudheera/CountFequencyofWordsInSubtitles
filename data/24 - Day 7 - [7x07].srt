4
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:14,350
Previously on 24...

5
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:17,290
That was bob cornell at nsa.

6
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:19,640
They've detected
another firewall breach.

7
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:20,810
There's been another attack?

8
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:24,380
Not yet, but they believe the
cip device is being utilized.

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,230
We have to assume dubaku is
initiating another attack.

10
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:28,160
Madam president.

11
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:29,390
What is it, tim?

12
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:31,880
I've just been forwarded
a scrambled call.

13
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:34,900
It's from colonel dubaku he's
demanding to speak with you.

14
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:37,910
The deadline for your forces to
begin their withdrawal has passed.

15
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:40,970
Go to the window. See
what you have done.

16
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:47,050
Comply with my demands within the
hour, or 10,000 more americans will die.

17
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,400
She's on her way up.

18
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,700
I'll call you when it's done.

19
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:56,360
Mr. Taylor, are you okay?

20
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,120
audio forensics cleaned
up the recording.

21
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:11,770
Walker is extraneous.

22
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:14,170
Kill her before you get here.

23
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:16,520
Larry, I don't think it's
worth it. There's nothing here.

24
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:18,450
All righT. Fine, help
janis coordinate with nsa.

25
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:20,750
I'm sorry about renee.
She was a good agent.

26
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,840
We don't know that she's dead yet!

27
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,320
I've devoted my life to the bureau
and you just expect me to believe that

28
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:29,080
the entire government's been corrupted.

29
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:30,360
Not all of them.

30
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:32,550
But until we find out
who, we can't trust anyone.

31
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:35,070
And the four of you really
think you can stop this?

32
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:38,090
We have to. It's as simple as that.

33
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,770
Dubaku wants you and your
wife. That's the deal.

34
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:44,900
You're asking us to risk our lives
to be delivered into dubaku's hands.

35
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,550
Listen to him, ule.

36
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:48,790
But how can we trust this man?

37
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:51,430
Because he has no reason to lie.

38
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,160
How are you doing, tony?

39
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:54,950
All right. Where's emerson?

40
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,960
He's dead.

41
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:58,460
You want matobo or not?

42
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,310
you got what you came for.

43
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:09,510
Now, get the hell out of here.

44
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,950
Did everything go smoothly?

45
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:13,310
We have the matobos,
that's what matters.

46
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:15,970
I heard about the planes on the radio.

47
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:18,370
The white house still has not complied.

48
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:19,440
What do you intend to do?

49
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:20,920
Exactly what we promised.

50
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,210
We're ready, sir.

51
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:23,850
Where's the target located?

52
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,210
Kidron, ohio.

53
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:26,300
Population?

54
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:30,560
Begin.

55
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:36,810
********

56
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,350
Larry.

57
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,680
We think this is the truck
the matobos were abducted in.

58
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,430
Where was this image taken?

59
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:49,760
Near northwoods airfield.

60
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:50,650
Were you able to track it?

61
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,930
Not beyond this sector. But they
were heading east on mckinley avenue.

62
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:57,480
All right. Make sure the vehicle I.D.Is
disseminated to all search teams and local agencies.

63
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:58,250
Yes, sir.

64
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,770
- Larry, I think I found something.
- Yeah?

65
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:05,230
I've been working nsa, trying to back-trace
the cip attack that took down the two planes.

66
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:10,000
And I found a code fragment which I think
could be residue from the cip intrusion.

67
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,610
I'm running a pattern match right now.

68
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:15,990
With any luck at all, we may be able to anticipate
where in the infrastructure they're targeting next.

69
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:16,940
And I need sean.

70
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:19,490
Janis, I don't want to waste
personnel on some wild-goose chase.

71
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:23,000
Dubaku's threatened to kill 10,000
more americans in the next 30 minutes.

72
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:25,790
I understand that, and I will
drop it the minute it feels cold.

73
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,980
All right, I'm going to brief the
white house. Keep me in the loop.

74
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:29,980
Sean.

75
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:37,380
Are you sure he's up to
running this operation?

76
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,390
- Larry's fine.
- Is he?

77
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,720
You're the one who told
me about him and renee.

78
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,560
This has got to be
hitting him pretty hard.

79
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:47,730
If I don't think larry can do his
job, I'll let you know, all right?

80
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:51,010
In the meantime, I need you
to open up a fresh socket.

81
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:11,180
You've reached agent brian gedge.

82
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:14,090
Please leave a message
and I'll get bk to you.

83
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:17,560
agent gedge, I expected
to hear from you by now.

84
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:21,580
It's urgent that I speak with the
first gentleman as soon as possible.

85
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:25,010
call me back, agent gedge.

86
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,130
This is extremely important.

87
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:28,970
Yes?

88
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:30,530
Larry moss with the fbi.

89
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,760
Where are we, larry?

90
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:34,850
We've I.D.'D a vehicle that we believe
was used in the matobos' abduction.

91
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:36,300
We're still trying to track it down.

92
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:38,070
And how long is that going to take?

93
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:40,130
I wish I could tell you, sir.
I don't have a time frame.

94
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:42,110
That's not good enough, larry.

95
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:45,170
Unless you get some results,
we're going to get hit again.

96
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:47,990
A lot of people are going to
die if you don't find dubaku.

97
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:51,380
With all respect, sir, I don't
need to be told what's at stake.

98
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:52,630
We're giving everything we can.

99
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,350
One of our agents has given her life.

100
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,740
Yes, I was told about
that. I'M... I'm sorry.

101
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:02,620
- I'll call you the minute we have something.
- We'll be waiting.

102
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,400
God...

103
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,000
The matobos have been
taken into a building.

104
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,480
546 adams.

105
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,010
- Okay, pull up the stats on that address.
- On it.

106
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,890
It's the ritter building,
four stories high.

107
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,370
The building is two years old.

108
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,670
- Give me the security specs.
- Give me a minute.

109
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,000
We're coming up on it.

110
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:32,150
I'm going to need your help.

111
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:56,650
I see you've chosen a target.

112
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:59,390
The boyd chemical
plant near kidron, ohio.

113
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:03,010
The cip device has enabled us
to take control of the main tank.

114
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:06,560
We're about to cause the
primary safety valves to fail.

115
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:16,390
Do you remember the last
time we saw each other, ule?

116
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:20,770
It was at a state
dinner in your residence.

117
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:23,460
We shared an excellent bottle of wine.

118
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:27,320
I offered my hand in
friendship and you...

119
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,180
slapped it away.

120
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:32,990
You gave me an ultimatum-- to
be the puppet for your military.

121
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:36,610
You could have had a long and
prosperous career as prime minister.

122
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,420
But now you're going back to
sangala as a traitor to your people.

123
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:41,150
I am prime minister.

124
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:42,880
I was elected by the people.

125
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,590
It's you and juma who are the traitors.

126
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:55,620
No.We brought order to sangala,

127
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:59,480
but you are trying to destroy
everything that we've built.

128
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:05,680
You'll be taken back to sangala, ule,

129
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:10,020
and you will give general juma the
names of all your fellow traitors.

130
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:13,280
I will never do that. Never.

131
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:25,370
believe me, you will.

132
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,140
Take them.

133
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:37,440
Any response from the president?

134
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:39,120
Not yet.

135
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:43,920
But once she sees dead americans lying
in the street, she will be less stubborn.

136
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:59,200
I'm inside, jack,
approaching the front desk.

137
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:01,060
Copy that.

138
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:04,990
Are the motobos still
on the third floor?

139
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:07,940
Affirmative, jack. They're being
moved. I'm just not sure where yet.

140
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:10,050
Copy that.

141
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,930
Good afternoon.

142
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,300
I'm agent walker with the fbi.

143
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:24,600
I don't have an appointment, but I'm here
to see mr. Roane of roane and associates.

144
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,660
- I'll let them know you're here.
- Actually, I don't want to be announced.

145
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:28,580
I'm here on official business.

146
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,630
All right.

147
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:33,370
So as far as you're concerned,
I was never here, understand?

148
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,800
Yes, ma'am.

149
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,370
Past security. Heading
toward the elevator.

150
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:44,060
We're on our way to
the service entrance.

151
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:56,880
Chloe, I'm on the third floor.

152
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,120
Law firm is on your left.

153
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:01,670
On your right is a suite of
offices where matobo's being held.

154
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,570
I see it.

155
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:05,500
Stairwell's down the
hallway to your left.

156
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,590
agent walker, we're at the door.

157
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,790
There's one guard outside
the suite, probably armed.

158
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,850
Bill, take the third
floor. Wait for my signal.

159
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:49,190
Go on.

160
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:07,080
Chloe, we're on the fourth floor in what
used to be the computer room. What now?

161
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:09,870
In the center of the room
there are two removable panels.

162
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:12,090
This should give you
access to the crawlspace.

163
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,960
Copy that.

164
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:30,110
Okay, we're clear. Let's go.

165
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,040
We're in.

166
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:05,490
I should never have
allowed you to come with me.

167
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,150
It was a mistake.

168
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:10,100
It was not your decision, ule.

169
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:15,600
We will be all right.

170
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:18,910
Jack bauer will be here soon.

171
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:26,750
Okay. We're at the heating unit.

172
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,850
Okay, jack, there's an airduct
leading off that unit; do you see it?

173
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:31,500
Yeah.

174
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,640
Follow that for about 30 yards
until you see an electrical junction.

175
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:37,730
Make a left, then another 20
yards you'll come to the vent.

176
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,200
This will give you a
view of the entire floor.

177
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,960
And the matobos?

178
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:44,980
They've been moved into a adjacent
room just off the main area.

179
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:47,660
Okay, copy that. Come on.

180
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:52,910
The entire nsa has been combing the firewall
searching for the next cip device breach.

181
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,730
If this were something, don't you
think they'd already know about it?

182
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,670
I can live without your
negativity today, sean.

183
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:02,590
There it is again,
that same code fragment.

184
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:07,040
"Kidron, ohio." What's in kidron,
ohio? Any sensitive instaltions?

185
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:08,500
Something dubaku might want to hit?

186
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:14,020
I don't know. Homeland has a high-value
target database; I'm cross-checking it now.

187
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:20,120
Okay. Okay, nothing in kidron itself,
but in the neighboring county there'S...

188
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:21,880
- boyd chemical.
- Boyd chemical. What do they make?

189
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:24,620
Insecticide. Please get me that number.

190
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,060
Hello? This is janis gold at fbi.

191
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:37,530
I need to speak to your plant
manager immediately, please.

192
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,090
Ma'am, as I just
stated I'm with the fbi.

193
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:43,330
Does that sound vaguely
important to you?

194
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:45,850
Now, connect me to john brunner.

195
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:53,230
Fbi? Uh, yeah, put her on.

196
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:56,040
This is john brunner.

197
00:12:56,050 --> 00:13:00,190
Hello. Mr. Brunner, this is
janis gold, fbi, D.C.Bureau.

198
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,600
What can I do for you?

199
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:04,580
We've been tracking some possible
breaches in the government firewall.

200
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:07,080
The firewall's designed to
protect installations like yours...

201
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,200
I know what it does, honey.

202
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:13,180
Um, we have tracked and isolated one
of these breaches in the kidron area.

203
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:16,750
I need to know are you
experiencing any problems right now?

204
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:18,830
As a matter of fact, we're
dealing with one right now.

205
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:19,650
What is it?

206
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:23,480
Three of our safety valves just
failed on the primary storage tank.

207
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,910
We're having trouble resetting them.

208
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:26,200
What's in that tank?

209
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:27,880
Methyl isocyanate.

210
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,980
It's concentrated
insecticide, highly toxic.

211
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,870
Can you-- what the
hell is this all about?

212
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:38,910
Mr. Brunner, I have reason to believe that
this is a terrorist attack on your facility.

213
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,130
Terrorist attack?

214
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:45,030
Yes, sir, I need you to initiate on-site
emergency procedures and stay on this line.

215
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,750
Shut down the tank.

216
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,100
- What's going on?
- Do it! Do it! My authority.

217
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:53,610
Damn. What is it?

218
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:56,220
- It's not responding.
- What do you mean? Try it again.

219
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,770
Nothing.

220
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,520
Pressure in the primary tank is rising.

221
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:07,750
Son of a bitch.

222
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,110
Mr. Brunner?

223
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:12,600
We cannot shut down the primary
tank and the pressure is building.

224
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:16,820
If we cannot stop this, we are
looking at atmospheric release.

225
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:18,460
Okay.

226
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:23,790
Get larry. Dubaku has targeted that
facility. We need to alert the president.

227
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:28,480
Mr. Brunner, you need to begin
evacuating people right now.

228
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:45,680
All right, agent moss, keep me
apprised. I'll speak to the president.

229
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:48,150
I just received an interagency alert.

230
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,070
The fbi just discovered
dubaku's next target.

231
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,900
A chemical plant, yeah. I just
got off the phone with larry moss.

232
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:54,840
I need to brief the president.

233
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:57,350
Has the first gentleman
spoken with the president?

234
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:00,650
Not yet. I talked to
agent gedge 40 minutes ago.

235
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:04,520
Mr. Taylor is the only person who can talk the
president into withdrawing our troops in sangala.

236
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:06,620
And that is our best way
to prevent this attack.

237
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:09,390
I know we need him. I'm
waiting for a call back.

238
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,180
The middle section's still
bothering me; read it again.

239
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:16,320
"Colonel dubaku and the juma regime have
killed "countless thousands of their own people,

240
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:18,550
"and now hundreds of
our fellow citizens.

241
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:21,640
They deserve your
prayers and your outrage."

242
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:25,940
I think the word "outrage" might be too strong
if you're trying to convey calm authority.

243
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:28,380
"Outrage" is the only word
to describe how I'm feeling,

244
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,580
and how every person in
this country will be feeling.

245
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:32,750
The american people deserve the truth.

246
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,990
Dubaku's already killed 300 americans.

247
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:37,930
God knows what else he has planned.

248
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:40,800
come in.

249
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:45,990
Could you excuse us, angela?

250
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,770
What is it?

251
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:57,270
The fbi believes they've detected
where the next attack will take place.

252
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:03,310
Dubaku's infiltrated a chemical
plant just outside of kidron, ohio.

253
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:06,600
He's causing the pressure on the
facility's primary tank to go critical.

254
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:11,940
If the tank erupts, over 3,000 gallons of methyl
isocyanate will be released into the atmosphere.

255
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:17,430
Given the prevailing winds, a very large,
very toxic cloud will sweep into town.

256
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,320
Methyl isocyanate is a
concentrated insecticide.

257
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:25,060
Even brief exposure causes severe lung
damage and chemical burns of the skin.

258
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:26,220
What's our time frame?

259
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:28,530
The tank could rupture
in less than 15 minutes.

260
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:29,950
They've begun evacuating?

261
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:32,650
We've already contacted emergency
responders on the ground in kidron.

262
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:35,200
It's just not enough
time to get everyone out.

263
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:39,540
Kidron's population's just over 30,000.

264
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:44,320
This projection says that
we could lose over 50%?

265
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:48,870
Oh, dear lord...

266
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:54,770
Right now, our only chance of stopping
this is finding dubaku and the cip device.

267
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,320
- You ready?
- Yeah.

268
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:05,120
Quietly.

269
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:09,360
Jack, I just intercepted an fbi alert
identifying dubaku's next target.

270
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:12,270
A chemical plant near kidron, ohio,
12 minutes from going critical.

271
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:15,420
There are 30,000 people in that
town, jack. We have to hurry.

272
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:18,210
Copy that.*****

273
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:21,390
Give me the scope out of the bag.

274
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:42,690
turning scope over to night-vision.

275
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:47,470
I don't see dubaku.

276
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:50,140
We've got nichols.

277
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,260
Three men with automatic weapons.

278
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:55,490
Three more over at the control
station, most likely armed.

279
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,700
Copy that.

280
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:01,080
That's dubaku.

281
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,490
We got dubaku. Chloe,
are you seeing this?

282
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:07,310
Yes. The control station looks like an
s-dart. 'S a reallypowerful processor.

283
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,610
It could be driving the cip device.

284
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:10,610
Copy.

285
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:14,350
Nsa's classified infrastructure team
is trying to plug the firewall breach.

286
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:15,220
Any luck so far?

287
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:16,620
None so far, but they're staying on it.

288
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:18,030
They have less than ten minutes left.

289
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:20,500
They're aware of that, sir,
but they're doing what they can.

290
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:23,320
Not now. What's going on at the plant?

291
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:25,300
I'm on with them now.

292
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:29,140
John? Did yotry flashing
the memory cards?

293
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,650
Three times, honey.

294
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:33,220
We're not in control
of the computer system.

295
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,390
I've already told my people
to get the hell out of here.

296
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:39,140
Normally, I don't allow people to call
me "honey," but we can disss thalater.

297
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:41,910
Yeah, well, it sounds like
you need to lighten up.

298
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:46,520
good, good. I'm heading
to the primary tank room.

299
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:49,150
I'm going to try to manually
release some of the pressure.

300
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:50,740
That's not going to stop it.

301
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:56,010
No, but it might buy us a few more
minutes so people can evacuate.

302
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:58,190
I've got a thousand
workers at this facility.

303
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,300
And I am responsible for their safety.

304
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:04,570
now look, I need you
to stay on the phone.

305
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:07,550
- I'm going to need some help.
- Absolutely. What c i do?

306
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:10,740
I don't have access to
the override schematics.

307
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:14,280
See if you can pull up the
operating procedures for tank one.

308
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:17,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got
it. I got it right here.

309
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:22,110
All right. Now look for the
emergency valve release sequence.

310
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:26,020
Okay. Uh, valve release.
I have it right here.

311
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:29,870
******

312
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:33,900
This, wait, this procedure is
going to release the chemical

313
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:36,700
right into the primary tank
room where you are right now.

314
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:39,390
I know that. I have respiratory gear on.

315
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:43,040
I'll be okay, just give me the sequence.

316
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,510
But how long will that protect you?

317
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:48,160
Don't worry about it, honey.

318
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:50,850
Uh, okay.

319
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:54,830
- Are you looking at the routing board?
- I am. Go ahead.

320
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:59,940
Set the bus switches to this
sequence from left to right:

321
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,240
Two.

322
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:03,580
Eight.

323
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,440
Seven.

324
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:06,700
Four.

325
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:09,050
Three.

326
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:11,080
Done.

327
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:15,630
The secondary flow valve should
be behind you and to your right.

328
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:18,780
I need you to turn
that clockwise please.

329
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:27,980
all right. All right, I got it.

330
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:33,190
Okay, that's one valve
down, three more to go.

331
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:47,930
Pressure inside the tank is approaching 400 psi.

332
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:49,530
How long before the tank ruptures?

333
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:50,710
Seven minutes.

334
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:52,330
We've got a problem.

335
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:53,320
What is it?

336
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,060
An alert.

337
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:56,740
Our hidden surveillance camera on the roof.

338
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,790
Almeida and bauer.

339
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,350
When was this taken?

340
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:01,810
20 minutes ago.

341
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:04,520
I thought you killed almeida and bauer?

342
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:05,400
Damn it!

343
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:07,380
You said this location was kept secret from everyone!

344
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:08,100
It was.

345
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:09,500
Then what are they doing here?

346
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:10,100
I don't know.

347
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:10,820
How did they find us?

348
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:12,400
I don't know!

349
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:14,580
600 psi and rising.

350
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:21,180
disengage the cip module.

351
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:23,100
Begin the offload.

352
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:26,610
What are you doing?

353
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:28,160
We're almost there.

354
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,290
We will continue this attack from another location.

355
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:34,410
Let's finish this.

356
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:35,860
We can handle them.

357
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:37,830
We need to get out of here now.

358
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:41,040
The cip module's disengaged,starting off load.

359
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:42,550
Hey,what the hell is that?

360
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:44,430
What the hell is that?

361
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:47,040
What's the matter?

362
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:51,040
The firewall breach just closed.

363
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:52,540
What?

364
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:53,850
What are you talking about?

365
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:56,910
No cip intrusion,the firewall is secure.

366
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:58,280
How?

367
00:21:58,370 --> 00:21:58,960
Nsa?

368
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:00,330
I don't know.

369
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:02,160
Bring the cip module.

370
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:04,240
Get motobo and his wife!

371
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:08,410
Bill,we should go with the second option on the assault.

372
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:09,350
Two-prong attack.

373
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:10,600
You and tony come through the main entrance.

374
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:11,620
We'll go in from here.

375
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,140
Copy.

376
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:15,270
Give me the c4 out of the bag.

377
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:40,980
Go!

378
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:49,750
Move.

379
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:51,900
Move!

380
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:15,760
get the cip device!

381
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:31,430
Clear!

382
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,960
All clear over here!

383
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:36,930
Get dubaku?

384
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:38,450
Negative!

385
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,610
Jack,I've got the cip device.

386
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:44,210
It's been destroyed.

387
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:45,160
Jack,it's renee.

388
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:46,170
The motobos are safe.

389
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:47,460
I'm taking them to the van.

390
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:48,470
Copy that.

391
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:49,570
I want you and bill to do a sweep.

392
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:51,030
See if you can find dubaku.

393
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:52,630
I'll cover the south side.

394
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:05,970
John?

395
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:07,660
John,are you still there?

396
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:10,320
yeah.

397
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:11,010
John,listen to me.

398
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,870
The terrorists are out of the system.

399
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,620
Please tell me what is happening right now.

400
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:23,380
automatic shutdown mode has kicked in.

401
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:25,560
Pressure's dropping.

402
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:28,850
I think we're gonna be all right.

403
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,220
Okay,that's great.

404
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,320
Now you-you gotta get out of there right now.

405
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:41,090
john?

406
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,650
I can't make the door...

407
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:47,050
I'm sending the rescue team.

408
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:48,240
A rescue team is on its way.

409
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:50,080
John,please stay with me.

410
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,680
Stay with me.

411
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:19,830
have they found dubaku?

412
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:20,950
Still searching.

413
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,220
First responders are five minutes away,jack.

414
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,020
Copy that.

415
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,840
Get up.

416
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:39,200
I said get up!

417
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:57,120
They're coming.

418
00:25:58,710 --> 00:26:00,950
Please don't make me do this.

419
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,920
I will go to your home,michael.

420
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:08,320
I'll make you wife watch as I kill your daughter,and then I will kill her.

421
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:10,170
So do as I ask.

422
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:12,760
Save your family.

423
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,870
Let me see your hands!

424
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:34,230
It's latham.

425
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:36,490
Where's dubaku?

426
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:38,000
I'm sorry.

427
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:42,530
cover!

428
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:50,030
Tony!

429
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,050
Bill!

430
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:52,370
Yeah!You all right?

431
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:54,420
Jack?

432
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:56,540
Jack?

433
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,870
Jack,can you hear me?

434
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,300
Yeah,yeah,we're okay.

435
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:01,690
What happened?

436
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:04,560
Latham was wired with explosives.

437
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:06,490
We still don't have dubaku.

438
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:07,260
What?

439
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,760
The cip device has been destroyed.

440
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:10,830
I want you to stay with the motobos.

441
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:12,980
Make sure they're safe.

442
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:14,780
jack the police are almost here.

443
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:16,620
If you get arrested,this entire operation goes out the window.

444
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:18,050
You have to get out of there.

445
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:19,120
Copy that.

446
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:19,800
He's gone.

447
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:21,470
We need to get back to the safe house.

448
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:22,790
Let's go.

449
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:40,500
sean,this stays both nsa and homeland have no idea why the breach at the kidron plant was stopped.

450
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:41,200
They're still looking.

451
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:42,380
We're working on it here also.

452
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:46,910
Janis is coordinating with a digital forensics team that she sent over to the plant.

453
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,120
This doesn't make any sense.

454
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:48,860
Why...

455
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:52,600
why would dubaku suddenly stop an attack when he was minutes away from causing mass casualties?

456
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,660
Maybe there was a malfunction in the cip device.

457
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:56,140
No,no,I don't want maybes,all right?

458
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:57,000
I want answers.

459
00:27:57,090 --> 00:27:58,330
We're doing everything we can,sir.

460
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:01,770
That's not good enough right now,is it?

461
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:03,180
I don't know what else to tell you,sir.

462
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:09,070
I know you're upset about renee,but getting angry at me is not going to make it go any faster.

463
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:12,550
If you think I'm yelling at you because of my history with agent walker,you are mistaken.

464
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:14,690
There are thousands of lives at stake here.

465
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:17,620
That's what concerns me.

466
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,750
Sorry,sir.

467
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:23,050
I want you and janis to work with nsa.

468
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:25,430
Find out where that cip device is being used.

469
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:29,400
If we find the device,weind dubaku.

470
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:43,300
I appreciate the call.

471
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:43,930
Thanks a lot.

472
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:46,190
Janis,larry wants you to interface with nsa.

473
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:49,290
See if you can back-trace that cip code fragment to its source.

474
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:50,830
I'll try.

475
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:53,630
Who were you talking to?

476
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,900
The head of the response team at the plant.

477
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:57,130
What did he say?

478
00:28:58,210 --> 00:28:58,970
Facility's clean.

479
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:01,200
A trace amount of the chemical was released,but not enough to do any damage,

480
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,640
and the site has been secured.

481
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,910
That's good.

482
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:05,300
What about the plant manager?

483
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:06,970
John brunner.

484
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:07,930
Is he okay?

485
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,600
No.

486
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:11,500
Will you do me a favor?

487
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:12,310
It depends.

488
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,120
I'd like to track down mr. Brunner's family.

489
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:17,790
I was the last one to speak with him,and I feel they should know how brave he was.

490
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:18,840
I'll see what I can find.

491
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:20,820
Thank you.

492
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:26,440
Janis,before you start sending flowers,you need to find out where that cip device was being used.

493
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:27,420
I know.

494
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:29,140
I'm on it.

495
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:52,260
Cleanup crews are already on site and we're continuing our evacuation of a one-mile radius around the chemical plant.

496
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,280
Casualties?

497
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:55,770
There was,in fact,one casualty,the plant manager.

498
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:59,720
13 other workers are being treated for chemical burns and inhalation of toxic fumes.

499
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:02,760
And there haven't been any other intrusions in the firewall?

500
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:03,720
No,ma'am.

501
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:05,650
It appears the crisis has been averted.

502
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:09,510
Except that no one's been able to explain how the firewall break disengaged.

503
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,480
Not yet.

504
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:12,520
The fbi has no idea how it happened...

505
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:13,470
it just happened.

506
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:15,880
And that's not an explanation.

507
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:18,310
Perhaps dubaku was firing another warning shot.

508
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,680
No,dubaku's already down two planes.

509
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:23,500
He's not afraid to take more lives.

510
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:26,420
In any event,we should be grateful.

511
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:30,610
I'm not one to accept good news unless I know where it comes from.

512
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:34,270
Until we have more answers,I want to maintain alert levels.

513
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,330
yes?

514
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:38,290
Madam president,I have admiral smith on line two.

515
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:39,290
Put him through.

516
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:40,610
Thank you,tim.

517
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:44,190
Admiral?

518
00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:48,030
I've been trying to reach agent gedge,and he hasn't picked up.

519
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:50,650
Yes,I'm sure I have the right number.

520
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:52,560
I just spoke to him over an hour ago.

521
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:57,140
He said he was outside samantha roth's apartment waiting for the first gentleman.

522
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,060
just find him.

523
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:03,190
I don't care who you have to pull off shift.

524
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:06,310
Still can't reach gedge.

525
00:31:06,410 --> 00:31:09,270
The secret service doesn't know where he is either.

526
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,620
I need to tell the president.

527
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:13,850
Maybe you should hold off.

528
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:18,960
The domestic threat's been lifted for now and she's on the phone with admiral smith.

529
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:26,540
I can't authorize the air strikes until our post-invasion plans are in place.

530
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:29,270
Finding a politically viable replacent,until that happens,

531
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:33,430
you need to keep your forces at full readiness.

532
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:36,980
The joint chiefs are getting impatient.

533
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:41,280
Madam president,we need to talk about your husband.

534
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:47,910
His theory about your son's death,he hasn't let it go.

535
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,820
What are you talking about?

536
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:56,630
He's been harassing roger's girlfriend,accusing her of complicity in the death of roger.

537
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:02,550
Henry and I went over it again and again with the fbi,and he swore to me he was past all that.

538
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:09,970
Well,he's found a private investigator who's feeding his conspiracy theory; taking advantage of him.

539
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:12,560
Please get henry on the phone.

540
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,970
I'm afraid I can't do that.

541
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:18,480
Henry's unreachable.

542
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:20,350
I don't understand.

543
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:24,360
Agent gedge hasn't been answering his phone.

544
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:27,140
Now,I wouldn't get too worried yet.

545
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:31,020
You're telling me my husband's gone missing?

546
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:35,580
Secret service has put out an apb.

547
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:38,340
They're going to ms.Roth's apartment.

548
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:43,520
Whatever's going on,i will find out soon enough.

549
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:50,230
Secret service dispatcher: This is a priority order code charlie zero charlie.

550
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:52,730
We need an immediate 20 on agent gedge.

551
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:58,950
All available field agents proceed to his last known location: 404 wilkinson drive.

552
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:15,010
you're making a mistake.

553
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:17,040
Think about it.

554
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:17,770
Shut up!

555
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:19,340
You haven't killed anybody yet.

556
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,860
You don't need to do this.

557
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:25,780
Gedge's plan to frame me is already blown.

558
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:32,260
If you kill me,they'll know it was murder,and they'll trace it back to you.

559
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,260
go ahead.

560
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:44,120
Where's agent gedge?

561
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:46,020
I can't reach him.

562
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:47,790
Gedge is dead.

563
00:34:47,890 --> 00:34:49,010
What happened?

564
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:51,280
Everything was going according to plan...

565
00:34:51,390 --> 00:34:52,220
but something went wrong.

566
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,800
Taylor killed gedge; I don't know how.

567
00:34:55,430 --> 00:34:56,560
Where's mr. Taylor now?

568
00:34:56,650 --> 00:34:58,370
He's right here.

569
00:34:58,690 --> 00:35:01,200
Don't kill h,bring him to me.

570
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,640
Yes,sir.

571
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,690
Prime minister matobo,ma'am,please come with me.

572
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:24,840
Chloe,pull up the ritter building on a satellite grid.

573
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:28,070
Look for any sign of dubaku leaving the site.

574
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:29,520
We've got to find him.

575
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,630
It's going to take me 20 minutes to task the satellite.

576
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:33,370
Then don't waste time talking about it.

577
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:37,530
Pull up satellite and traffic cams,street corners and metro stations.

578
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:38,320
What's the priority?

579
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,360
I can only do one thing at timE.

580
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:40,120
Satellite!

581
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:41,460
Fine.

582
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:43,690
Bill,we need to rethink this.

583
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:44,570
What do you mean?

584
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:46,570
You were set up to surveil an undercover operation.

585
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:47,750
Your cover's been blown.

586
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:48,950
The police are after us.

587
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,990
We are not equipped to look for one man in a city of millions.

588
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,830
We neeadditional resources.

589
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:55,170
What are you suggesting?

590
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:58,320
It's time to contact outside agencies.

591
00:35:58,410 --> 00:35:59,650
The government?

592
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:00,390
Yes.

593
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:01,980
I thought you said the government couldn't be trusted.

594
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:03,370
Right now,we don't have a choice.

595
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:04,210
It can't be trusted.

596
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:06,830
We can't trust anybody,that's why we're working on the outside.

597
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,840
President taylor can be trusted.

598
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:10,350
I'm not questioning that,prime minister.

599
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:12,560
It's the people around her who can't be trusted.

600
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:13,910
Mr. Buchanan,jack's right.

601
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:15,490
We need help.

602
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:17,070
It's too dangerous.

603
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,700
We can limit the flow of information.

604
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:21,200
Prime minister matobo can get us past the president's outer circle--

605
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:23,780
that way,we can at least explain to her why and what we're doing.

606
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:24,700
I think jack's right.

607
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:26,120
We left a lot of clues in that building.

608
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,590
We're vulnerable; we can't do this on our own anymore.

609
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:35,640
Am I supposed to remain in hiding with you,pretend that my wife and i are still being held hostage or dead?

610
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:40,170
I need to return to the white house and help the president save what's left of my country.

611
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,940
Let my husband do this.

612
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:44,110
Let him call president taylor.

613
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:47,010
She will listen to him.

614
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:54,210
Bill,you want to find dubaku,make the call.

615
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:05,350
All right.

616
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,630
Get me the white house.

617
00:37:11,850 --> 00:37:17,610
Representatives from boyd chemical have assured local authorities that the immediate crisis s passed.

618
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:22,140
However,this has done little to calm the nerves of the citizens of kidron,ohio,

619
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:25,480
many of whom have taken shelter in neighboring communities.

620
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:29,570
Again,we have confirmed one fatality inside the plant itself.

621
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:33,890
13 others,all boyd employees,are being treated at local medical centers...

622
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:35,110
- Madame president,- yes?

623
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:37,750
I have prime minister matobo callg foyoU.

624
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:38,820
Matobo?

625
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:39,920
Yes,ma'am.

626
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:41,230
You're tracing it?

627
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:44,080
We tried,madame president,but it's a secure line.

628
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:46,000
Put him through.

629
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:47,880
Prime minister?

630
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:49,180
Yes,madame president.

631
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:50,440
Are you all right?

632
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,400
Thank god my wife and i are both fine.

633
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:53,730
We were rescued.

634
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:55,010
By whom?

635
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:56,150
Where are you?

636
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,490
In a safe place.

637
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:02,090
Madame president,you need to listen to me.

638
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:05,300
The people who rescued us,they have acquired the cip device.

639
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:10,040
It has been destroyed,and your country is no longer under immediate threat.

640
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:13,510
Who are these people,and tell me how this happened.

641
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:17,640
I will tell you everything in person,but,uh,this must happen privately.

642
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:19,750
I must speak to you alone.

643
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:21,510
Why alone?

644
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,870
They will bring me to you,madame president.

645
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:26,000
We will arrive in ten minutes.

646
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:28,270
I'll be waiting for you.

647
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:32,420
They tried to trace the call,but the line held.

648
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:38,330
Ethan,I need to see you right now.

649
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:47,190
Yes,madame president?

650
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:50,120
I just spoke to prime minister matobo.

651
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:51,910
What?

652
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,320
He's safe.

653
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,040
How?

654
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:54,810
What happened?

655
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:55,760
He'll let us know when he gets here.

656
00:38:55,850 --> 00:38:57,060
He's on his way now.

657
00:38:57,130 --> 00:38:58,960
He wants a private meeting.

658
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:03,260
Bring him in through the south entrance,and keep this to as few people as possible.

659
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:04,910
All right.

660
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,120
Jack,I've mapped a route for you to the white house.

661
00:39:12,210 --> 00:39:14,780
It's mostly side streets,but there will be fewer traffic cams.

662
00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:16,620
Okay,good.Send it to my phone.

663
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:17,550
We're ready.

664
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:18,440
Let's go.

665
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:21,850
As soon as we set the vehicle in front of the building,agent walker will move mr. Matobo.

666
00:39:21,930 --> 00:39:23,040
Jack...

667
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:23,960
jack!

668
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:25,820
What?

669
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,490
I'm not going.

670
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:30,270
What are you talking about?

671
00:39:30,350 --> 00:39:32,900
If the government gets their hands on tony,they'll arrest him.

672
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:37,370
I already told you-- I did some pretty bad things before I teamed up with bill.

673
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:39,770
Tony,take it from me...

674
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:41,630
you need to deal with the consequences.

675
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:42,970
And believe me,I will.

676
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:43,610
But not yet.

677
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:45,580
Not till we get dubaku.

678
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:47,250
I'm working on a lead.

679
00:39:47,330 --> 00:39:50,730
I've got a guy on emerson's crew who might have some intel we can use.

680
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:52,290
Let him do this,jack.

681
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,790
He's the reason we got this far.

682
00:39:57,890 --> 00:39:59,090
Fine.

683
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:02,410
But you give me your word as soon as this as over,you turn yourself in.

684
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:05,210
We'll stand behind you.

685
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:07,840
All right,you have my word.

686
00:40:10,970 --> 00:40:11,570
Good luck.

687
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:13,110
Be careful.

688
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:09,400
I was on my way to work,so I thought I'd stop in and see you.

689
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:11,250
I tried calling you earlier.

690
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,860
I'm sorry; I've been busy.

691
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:14,010
Are you all right?

692
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:15,480
You look exhausted.

693
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:17,460
It's just been a long day.

694
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,430
Well,I hope you're still coming over for dinner.

695
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,210
I'm making lasagna.

696
00:41:21,290 --> 00:41:25,670
And my sister promises not to give you any more dirty looks.

697
00:41:26,130 --> 00:41:27,620
You haven't forgotten,have you?

698
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:28,590
No.

699
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:29,200
No.

700
00:41:29,210 --> 00:41:31,680
It's just that I've got some business to attend to.

701
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:33,800
Samuel,you work too much.

702
00:41:33,890 --> 00:41:36,920
Every time you come into the diner,you're always on the phone.

703
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:39,110
I have to,maria,so that,one day,

704
00:41:39,210 --> 00:41:42,250
I can finally take you away from that awful place that you work in.

705
00:41:42,330 --> 00:41:43,900
Well,we met in that awful place.

706
00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:46,350
Don't forget that.

707
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,470
I'll see you later.

708
00:41:48,530 --> 00:41:49,680
Okay.

709
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:04,650
Go ahead.

710
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:06,270
Have you got mr. Taylor?

711
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:06,950
Yes.

712
00:42:06,970 --> 00:42:08,490
I'm about three minutes away.

713
00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:11,440
There's a korean grocer opposite my building.

714
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,560
One of my men will meet you out back.

715
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:15,780
Bring taylor inside.

716
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:17,570
What are you gonna do to him?

717
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:19,490
Just make sure you weren't followed.

718
