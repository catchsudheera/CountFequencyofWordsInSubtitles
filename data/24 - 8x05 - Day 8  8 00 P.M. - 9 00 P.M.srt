1
00:00:20,332 --> 00:00:22,133
I need to know about my brother.

2
00:00:22,134 --> 00:00:25,536
He's alive.
Get out now.

3
00:00:25,537 --> 00:00:26,804
It can't be long

4
00:00:26,805 --> 00:00:28,806
before they realize it's you.

5
00:00:28,807 --> 00:00:30,141
I need you to get
back in the car.

6
00:00:30,142 --> 00:00:31,142
Ah!

7
00:00:32,878 --> 00:00:36,047
Your brother was involved
with the attack.

8
00:00:36,048 --> 00:00:38,349
He's the insider
we've been looking for.

9
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:39,651
What's going on?

10
00:00:39,652 --> 00:00:41,452
The body triggered
a Hazmat alarm.

11
00:00:41,453 --> 00:00:42,720
It's highly
enriched uranium.

12
00:00:42,721 --> 00:00:43,888
You mean it's weapons-grade?

13
00:00:43,889 --> 00:00:45,490
How the hell did he come
into contact with that?

14
00:00:45,491 --> 00:00:47,191
I think I know the answer.

15
00:00:47,192 --> 00:00:49,727
Someone approached my brother
with weapons-grade uranium.

16
00:00:49,728 --> 00:00:51,863
Who?
Someone who had access

17
00:00:51,864 --> 00:00:53,498
to decommissioned
Soviet stockpile.

18
00:00:53,499 --> 00:00:55,233
You must find the Russians

19
00:00:55,234 --> 00:00:57,335
before they can get
the uranium to my brother.

20
00:00:57,336 --> 00:00:58,770
I want proof
that the rods exist,

21
00:00:58,771 --> 00:01:00,038
or you will not be paid.

22
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:02,473
You want proof, huh?

23
00:01:02,474 --> 00:01:04,008
<i>Come with me.</i>

24
00:01:04,009 --> 00:01:05,343
My younger son,

25
00:01:05,344 --> 00:01:07,312
he was transporting the rods,

26
00:01:07,313 --> 00:01:08,646
and he was careless.

27
00:01:08,647 --> 00:01:10,682
There, you have your proof.

28
00:01:10,683 --> 00:01:12,650
You were undercover
for nearly two years

29
00:01:12,651 --> 00:01:14,552
with the Russian mob.

30
00:01:14,553 --> 00:01:16,054
<i>Your cover is still intact.</i>

31
00:01:16,055 --> 00:01:18,489
Are you asking me
to go back in?

32
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:20,925
Agent Walker hasn't been
undercover for over six years.

33
00:01:20,926 --> 00:01:22,927
I think you're making
a mistake by putting her in.

34
00:01:22,928 --> 00:01:26,397
You must have other options.

35
00:01:26,398 --> 00:01:27,532
She's our only way in.

36
00:01:27,533 --> 00:01:28,700
Fine, then I want
to go with her.

37
00:01:28,701 --> 00:01:30,201
I assume your plan is

38
00:01:30,202 --> 00:01:31,636
trying to set up
a competing buy?

39
00:01:31,637 --> 00:01:32,837
I'll act as a buyer.

40
00:01:32,838 --> 00:01:35,239
I'm looking for Vladimir.

41
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,708
Vlad disappeared.

42
00:01:36,709 --> 00:01:38,376
But you can find him.

43
00:01:38,377 --> 00:01:40,378
They know where I am 24/7.

44
00:01:40,379 --> 00:01:41,713
I'm still in prison.

45
00:01:41,714 --> 00:01:43,247
Parole bracelet?

46
00:01:43,248 --> 00:01:44,882
I can get this off.

47
00:01:45,751 --> 00:01:46,784
You can't cut bracelet.

48
00:01:46,785 --> 00:01:47,919
I'm not gonna cut the bracelet.

49
00:01:50,456 --> 00:01:51,723
What the hell have you done?!

50
00:01:51,724 --> 00:01:53,057
That's it,
this is over.

51
00:01:53,058 --> 00:01:55,593
Maybe for you, Jack, but
I'm just getting started.

52
00:02:22,621 --> 00:02:24,455
I thought you were
dead or captured.

53
00:02:24,456 --> 00:02:25,790
Where have you been?

54
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:27,892
It took me this long
to get clear.

55
00:02:27,893 --> 00:02:29,227
I'm with Bazhaev.

56
00:02:29,228 --> 00:02:30,795
To hell with Bazhaev!

57
00:02:30,796 --> 00:02:33,231
Everything we have worked for,
it's all over because of him.

58
00:02:33,232 --> 00:02:34,999
It's not over, General.

59
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,334
Of course it is!

60
00:02:36,335 --> 00:02:37,735
Your brother
is still alive,

61
00:02:37,736 --> 00:02:40,338
and your plan to replace him
as head of state is finished.

62
00:02:40,339 --> 00:02:42,407
Now his security forces
are rounding up our people

63
00:02:42,408 --> 00:02:44,075
all over the city.

64
00:02:44,076 --> 00:02:47,311
General Amiri was just pulled
from his home five minutes ago,

65
00:02:47,312 --> 00:02:49,113
in front of his wife
and children.

66
00:02:49,114 --> 00:02:51,949
Look, the Americans
won't let him continue.

67
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:53,584
They'll accuse him
of human rights violations

68
00:02:53,585 --> 00:02:55,486
and threaten to pull out
of the peace talks.

69
00:02:55,487 --> 00:02:57,255
Once we have the uranium,

70
00:02:57,256 --> 00:02:59,457
my brother will become
irrelevant anyway.

71
00:02:59,458 --> 00:03:01,359
You are being hunted
like an animal.

72
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,994
How do you expect
to get the uranium?

73
00:03:02,995 --> 00:03:04,395
Bazhaev can deliver it to us,

74
00:03:04,396 --> 00:03:07,565
but first I need payment
wired to his account.

75
00:03:10,803 --> 00:03:11,836
It's all right.

76
00:03:11,837 --> 00:03:13,204
Mm. Thank you.

77
00:03:34,993 --> 00:03:37,462
Papa, there's a clinic
in Mt. Vernon.

78
00:03:37,463 --> 00:03:39,931
I found a doctor
who can treat him.

79
00:03:39,932 --> 00:03:41,265
We have been through this.

80
00:03:41,266 --> 00:03:42,600
No doctors.

81
00:03:42,601 --> 00:03:44,302
Yes, but this one
has a family.

82
00:03:44,303 --> 00:03:46,304
I know where they are,
I know their names.

83
00:03:46,305 --> 00:03:48,339
I'll make sure
he keeps his mouth shut.

84
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:49,941
And you can guarantee
no one else in this clinic

85
00:03:49,942 --> 00:03:51,275
will find out?

86
00:03:51,276 --> 00:03:54,145
Another doctor, a nurse, no one?

87
00:03:54,146 --> 00:03:56,948
The authorities know
about the nuclear material

88
00:03:56,949 --> 00:03:58,349
or they will soon enough,

89
00:03:58,350 --> 00:03:59,717
and they'll be
looking everywhere.

90
00:03:59,718 --> 00:04:03,087
Putting Oleg in a clinic
would lead them right to us.

91
00:04:03,088 --> 00:04:06,691
He's going to die if
we don't get him help.

92
00:04:06,692 --> 00:04:09,894
Then he's going to die.

93
00:04:12,231 --> 00:04:14,966
But alone like this?

94
00:04:14,967 --> 00:04:18,202
In a cold room
behind the kitchen?

95
00:04:18,203 --> 00:04:21,506
He's my brother, Papa,

96
00:04:21,507 --> 00:04:24,608
and he's your son.

97
00:04:29,248 --> 00:04:30,815
All right.

98
00:04:30,816 --> 00:04:32,149
Take him to the country house.

99
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:34,285
Ulana will look after him.

100
00:04:34,286 --> 00:04:38,022
Thank you, Papa.

101
00:04:39,324 --> 00:04:40,825
What is it?

102
00:04:40,826 --> 00:04:43,494
Farhad is asking for you.

103
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:54,572
You have news for me?

104
00:04:54,573 --> 00:04:55,940
Yes.

105
00:04:55,941 --> 00:04:58,609
The money will be transferred
to your account shortly.

106
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:01,345
When can I take
possession of the rods?

107
00:05:01,346 --> 00:05:04,181
As soon as we have the money.

108
00:05:04,182 --> 00:05:06,951
Five hours.

109
00:05:06,952 --> 00:05:08,653
Good.

110
00:05:08,654 --> 00:05:11,455
I'll help you pass the time.

111
00:05:19,665 --> 00:05:21,766
You have a preference?

112
00:05:21,767 --> 00:05:23,801
No.

113
00:05:23,802 --> 00:05:26,202
Then take both.

114
00:05:37,883 --> 00:05:40,418
He's still bleeding out.

115
00:05:40,419 --> 00:05:43,687
This should cauterize the wound.

116
00:05:46,758 --> 00:05:49,158
Okay, it's working.

117
00:05:50,896 --> 00:05:52,597
Who are you calling?

118
00:05:52,598 --> 00:05:53,931
Hastings.
Why?

119
00:05:53,932 --> 00:05:55,232
Because I'm shutting
this operation down.

120
00:05:55,233 --> 00:05:56,634
You shouldn't be in the
field, and this proves it.

121
00:05:56,635 --> 00:05:57,902
This was the only play, Jack.

122
00:05:57,903 --> 00:05:59,136
You would've done
the same thing.

123
00:05:59,137 --> 00:06:00,671
The play was to get him
to cooperate.

124
00:06:00,672 --> 00:06:02,640
He <i>will</i> cooperate.
How do you figure?

125
00:06:02,641 --> 00:06:04,241
Look, I know these guys, Jack.

126
00:06:04,242 --> 00:06:05,743
The only thing that Ziya likes

127
00:06:05,744 --> 00:06:07,378
more than 13-year-old girls
is money.

128
00:06:07,379 --> 00:06:09,146
Ã­  He'd have butchered himself
for a score like this.

129
00:06:09,147 --> 00:06:10,815
Yeah, well, Hastings still
needs to know the truth.

130
00:06:10,816 --> 00:06:11,949
The truth?

131
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:14,350
That you're unstable!

132
00:06:19,324 --> 00:06:23,527
Look... I don't blame you

133
00:06:23,528 --> 00:06:25,296
after everything
you've been through,

134
00:06:25,297 --> 00:06:27,798
but you are not fit
for this mission.

135
00:06:27,799 --> 00:06:30,601
I went through
a rough patch, yeah,

136
00:06:30,602 --> 00:06:32,436
but I came out
on the other side.

137
00:06:32,437 --> 00:06:34,837
And I don't think you have.

138
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:38,109
The bottom line is,
I'm still the best chance

139
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:39,944
that anyone has of
intercepting that uranium,

140
00:06:39,945 --> 00:06:42,345
and I can do it now.

141
00:06:47,119 --> 00:06:49,853
So, what's it going to be, you
making that phone call or what?

142
00:06:59,297 --> 00:07:01,232
He's waking up, Jack.

143
00:07:01,233 --> 00:07:03,634
Better make up your mind.

144
00:07:08,073 --> 00:07:09,740
Fine.

145
00:07:09,741 --> 00:07:12,143
You see what you can
get out of him.

146
00:07:12,144 --> 00:07:16,880
But don't forget, I'm listening.

147
00:07:29,394 --> 00:07:31,562
Renee!

148
00:07:31,563 --> 00:07:33,097
Shut up, Ziya.

149
00:07:33,098 --> 00:07:35,032
Renee!

150
00:07:35,033 --> 00:07:36,200
You'll get your painkillers
as soon as we get out of here.

151
00:07:36,201 --> 00:07:38,436
What did you do?!
I got the bracelet off,

152
00:07:38,437 --> 00:07:40,104
all right, I did you a favor.

153
00:07:40,105 --> 00:07:43,140
You crazy bitch!
You cut off thumb!

154
00:07:43,141 --> 00:07:44,675
Look, what's done is done.

155
00:07:44,676 --> 00:07:47,011
You can either stay here
and whine about it like a baby,

156
00:07:47,012 --> 00:07:49,513
or you can come with me
and be a rich man.

157
00:07:49,514 --> 00:07:53,250
Look, I'm willing to give you a
point on this deal off the top.

158
00:07:53,251 --> 00:07:56,120
It's a lot of money, Ziya.

159
00:07:56,121 --> 00:07:57,455
How much?

160
00:07:57,456 --> 00:07:58,956
Two-and-a-half million.

161
00:07:58,957 --> 00:08:02,026
Maybe three when it's all done.

162
00:08:02,027 --> 00:08:04,895
Two million?

163
00:08:04,896 --> 00:08:06,464
You're serious?

164
00:08:06,465 --> 00:08:08,865
You tell me.

165
00:08:11,203 --> 00:08:13,237
I take this deal to Vladimir,

166
00:08:13,238 --> 00:08:15,239
and it's not real,
you know what happens?!

167
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,640
Why would I be here
if this wasn't real?!

168
00:08:19,044 --> 00:08:20,444
Fine, forget it, Ziya.

169
00:08:20,445 --> 00:08:21,746
I'll find Vladimir my own way.

170
00:08:21,747 --> 00:08:24,147
No, wait!

171
00:08:24,883 --> 00:08:29,353
I don't know
where he is exactly,

172
00:08:29,354 --> 00:08:30,721
but where he might be.

173
00:08:30,722 --> 00:08:32,556
Tell me.

174
00:08:32,557 --> 00:08:34,792
No, I'll take you there myself.

175
00:08:34,793 --> 00:08:36,160
You have a car?

176
00:08:36,161 --> 00:08:37,595
I have truck;
it's parked out back.

177
00:08:37,596 --> 00:08:39,029
All right, I'll drive.

178
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:41,430
Come on!

179
00:08:42,167 --> 00:08:43,200
Yeah?

180
00:08:43,201 --> 00:08:44,401
Jack, I just found out in my

181
00:08:44,402 --> 00:08:46,537
background check that Ziya
has a probation officer.

182
00:08:46,538 --> 00:08:48,606
How do you want
to handle this?
You don't need to.

183
00:08:48,607 --> 00:08:49,874
He has a tracking bracelet.

184
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:51,108
Not anymore.

185
00:08:51,109 --> 00:08:52,476
I don't understand.

186
00:08:52,477 --> 00:08:54,178
Those things have
anti-tamper mechanisms.

187
00:08:54,179 --> 00:08:56,247
You can't cut them off him
without triggering an alarm.

188
00:08:56,248 --> 00:08:58,549
Yeah, well, trust me,
it's been taken care of.

189
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:00,384
Jack, what happened in there?

190
00:09:00,385 --> 00:09:03,521
Renee got the result
she wanted.

191
00:09:03,522 --> 00:09:05,489
Ziya's taking her to Vladimir.

192
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:06,757
Dana's still working

193
00:09:06,758 --> 00:09:07,958
on your cover profile.

194
00:09:07,959 --> 00:09:09,560
Okay, they're moving.

195
00:09:09,561 --> 00:09:11,961
I'll call you when it's ready.

196
00:09:24,009 --> 00:09:26,610
Jack's still waiting
on the rest of that profile.

197
00:09:26,611 --> 00:09:27,945
I'm still working the timeline.

198
00:09:27,946 --> 00:09:29,713
Tell him I'm almost finished.

199
00:09:29,714 --> 00:09:32,114
Okay.

200
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:37,655
Aren't you going to get that?

201
00:09:37,656 --> 00:09:40,991
Yeah, probably should.

202
00:09:40,992 --> 00:09:43,194
Hello?

203
00:09:43,195 --> 00:09:44,695
I'm in the middle of something.

204
00:09:44,696 --> 00:09:46,230
Hold on a second.

205
00:09:46,231 --> 00:09:48,465
Chloe, I will send that profile
to you as soon as I'm done.

206
00:09:48,466 --> 00:09:50,866
Okay.

207
00:09:53,805 --> 00:09:55,906
I told you not to call.

208
00:09:55,907 --> 00:09:58,442
Yeah, I know what you told me.

209
00:09:58,443 --> 00:10:00,578
But now that I'm here
in your apartment,

210
00:10:00,579 --> 00:10:02,012
I just can't help but miss you.

211
00:10:02,013 --> 00:10:04,081
My shift is over in the morning.

212
00:10:04,082 --> 00:10:06,016
I will see you then.

213
00:10:06,017 --> 00:10:08,185
Yeah, well, that's just not
going to work now, is it?

214
00:10:08,186 --> 00:10:09,820
I'm right in the middle
of something, Kevin.

215
00:10:09,821 --> 00:10:11,422
Turn on the news
if you don't believe me.

216
00:10:11,423 --> 00:10:12,756
Hey, that's not my problem.

217
00:10:12,757 --> 00:10:14,358
Okay, I need to see you.

218
00:10:14,359 --> 00:10:17,461
You have 15 minutes.
That's not possible.

219
00:10:17,462 --> 00:10:19,864
Okay, you got 30.

220
00:10:19,865 --> 00:10:21,465
Who said I can't be reasonable?

221
00:10:21,466 --> 00:10:23,934
Kevin...

222
00:10:23,935 --> 00:10:26,170
Don't make me call that
little boyfriend of yours.

223
00:10:26,171 --> 00:10:28,072
Rock his perfect little world.

224
00:10:28,073 --> 00:10:30,608
"Hey, pal, congratulations
on the engagement."

225
00:10:30,609 --> 00:10:34,044
By the way, her name's not
Dana Walsh, it's Jenny Scott.

226
00:10:34,045 --> 00:10:35,913
Oh, did I mention
that she's an ex-con?

227
00:10:35,914 --> 00:10:37,548
No, no, no,
nothing too serious.

228
00:10:37,549 --> 00:10:41,752
"Just accessory to murder
is all."

229
00:10:41,753 --> 00:10:43,554
You still there?

230
00:10:43,555 --> 00:10:45,589
Yeah, I'm here.

231
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:47,990
See you soon.

232
00:10:54,599 --> 00:10:57,401
Arlo, can I ask you something?

233
00:10:57,402 --> 00:10:59,136
Yes, I'm available
Saturday night,

234
00:10:59,137 --> 00:11:01,405
and I can change my plans
for Friday if you want.

235
00:11:01,406 --> 00:11:03,374
Also, I'm free on Thursday.

236
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:04,541
Look, Arlo, I'm sorry.

237
00:11:04,542 --> 00:11:06,377
It's just,
a situation's come up,

238
00:11:06,378 --> 00:11:08,045
and I have to go home
for a while.

239
00:11:08,046 --> 00:11:09,647
Dana, we're in the middle
of a major protocol.

240
00:11:09,648 --> 00:11:12,283
I understand that,
and I won't be long, I promise.

241
00:11:12,284 --> 00:11:14,285
But I need you
to cover for me.

242
00:11:14,286 --> 00:11:15,452
Put the finishing touches

243
00:11:15,453 --> 00:11:17,154
on the profile
for Renee Walker and Jack Bauer.

244
00:11:17,155 --> 00:11:19,223
And if I ask what this is about,
you'll tell me...

245
00:11:19,224 --> 00:11:21,325
That it's none
of your business.
Right.

246
00:11:21,326 --> 00:11:22,693
I thought so.

247
00:11:22,694 --> 00:11:24,428
Send it to Chloe's screen
as soon as you're finished.

248
00:11:24,429 --> 00:11:25,462
Okay.

249
00:11:25,463 --> 00:11:27,298
Thank you, Arlo.
I owe you one.

250
00:11:27,299 --> 00:11:30,069
One what?

251
00:11:54,995 --> 00:11:57,895
I look forward to
seeing you tomorrow.

252
00:12:01,362 --> 00:12:03,196
They're concerned,
but they're all still

253
00:12:03,197 --> 00:12:05,598
planning to attend
the signing ceremony tomorrow.

254
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:07,667
Well, I've got some bad news.

255
00:12:07,668 --> 00:12:09,002
Apparently, killing

256
00:12:09,003 --> 00:12:10,303
President Hassan
was only part

257
00:12:10,304 --> 00:12:11,471
of his brother's plan.

258
00:12:11,472 --> 00:12:12,839
CTU now believes

259
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,541
he's also trying to acquire
weapons-grade uranium.

260
00:12:15,542 --> 00:12:17,644
From whom?

261
00:12:17,645 --> 00:12:19,579
A Russian crime syndicate
here in New York.

262
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:20,813
Half of them are

263
00:12:20,814 --> 00:12:22,515
ex-Soviet Army or KGB.

264
00:12:22,516 --> 00:12:24,384
If anyone had access
to unsecured stockpiles...

265
00:12:24,385 --> 00:12:27,420
It's what we've been afraid of
since the Wall came down.

266
00:12:27,421 --> 00:12:29,555
Is President Hassan
aware of this?

267
00:12:29,556 --> 00:12:31,491
He's the one
who told CTU about it.

268
00:12:31,492 --> 00:12:32,792
Director Hastings
has already initiated

269
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:35,028
an undercover operation
to try to recover the uranium

270
00:12:35,029 --> 00:12:36,763
before it's smuggled
out of the country.

271
00:12:36,764 --> 00:12:39,232
The nuclear materials
are here on U.S. soil?

272
00:12:39,233 --> 00:12:41,367
Are they sure?
Afraid so.

273
00:12:41,368 --> 00:12:44,537
Ethan, you asked
if President Hassan

274
00:12:44,538 --> 00:12:46,105
was aware
of this. Why?

275
00:12:46,106 --> 00:12:48,374
Helps explain what's been going
on in the Islamic Republic.

276
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:50,209
I just spoke

277
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:52,311
with our ambassador
in the I.R.K.

278
00:12:52,312 --> 00:12:54,714
Hassan's security forces are
sweeping through the capital,

279
00:12:54,715 --> 00:12:58,051
arresting opposition leaders,
shuttering news organizations.

280
00:12:58,052 --> 00:13:00,019
Has he declared martial law?

281
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,387
Not officially, but effectively,

282
00:13:01,388 --> 00:13:03,056
that's exactly
what he's been doing.

283
00:13:03,057 --> 00:13:05,425
Who can blame him?

284
00:13:05,426 --> 00:13:07,527
I mean, his brother can't
have been acting alone.

285
00:13:07,528 --> 00:13:08,695
We want Hassan cracking down

286
00:13:08,696 --> 00:13:10,063
on hardliners in
his own government.

287
00:13:10,064 --> 00:13:11,631
Except that he's defying
his country's laws,

288
00:13:11,632 --> 00:13:14,600
as well as his international
human rights obligations.

289
00:13:14,601 --> 00:13:17,537
And if he continues, it may
delegitimize the peace accord.

290
00:13:17,538 --> 00:13:20,873
Is President Hassan
back yet from CTU?

291
00:13:20,874 --> 00:13:22,475
He'll be here in ten minutes.

292
00:13:22,476 --> 00:13:24,610
I want to speak to him... alone.

293
00:13:24,611 --> 00:13:27,480
I'll take care of it.

294
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:38,257
That's enough.

295
00:13:38,258 --> 00:13:40,126
What's your problem?

296
00:13:40,127 --> 00:13:43,296
I need you thinking clearly.

297
00:13:43,297 --> 00:13:46,165
You tell me you'd get me
real painkiller.

298
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:49,301
Put it away.

299
00:13:55,008 --> 00:13:56,409
I'm surprised.

300
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:58,644
I'm surprised you take

301
00:13:58,645 --> 00:14:02,448
deal to him again
after what he did to you.

302
00:14:02,449 --> 00:14:04,784
How much further?

303
00:14:04,785 --> 00:14:06,252
Okay.

304
00:14:06,253 --> 00:14:08,354
You don't want to
talk about Vladimir.

305
00:14:08,355 --> 00:14:10,289
I understand.

306
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:12,625
I don't blame you.

307
00:14:12,626 --> 00:14:17,029
After all, what is there
to say about such a man?

308
00:14:18,465 --> 00:14:20,767
Nothing good,
nothing very...

309
00:14:20,768 --> 00:14:22,101
Just tell me

310
00:14:22,102 --> 00:14:25,137
how much further.

311
00:14:26,373 --> 00:14:27,874
Ten minute.

312
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:30,376
Touchy, touchy.

313
00:14:34,281 --> 00:14:35,481
Yeah?

314
00:14:35,482 --> 00:14:37,316
Arlo just locked
your cover profile.

315
00:14:37,317 --> 00:14:39,018
I'm uplinking it to you now.

316
00:14:39,019 --> 00:14:41,487
Okay, hold on one sec.

317
00:14:44,324 --> 00:14:45,491
Okay, I got it.

318
00:14:45,492 --> 00:14:46,659
Hey, you're taking me out

319
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,361
of Renee's comm
when you call, right?

320
00:14:48,362 --> 00:14:49,562
Yes.

321
00:14:49,563 --> 00:14:51,430
Okay, I want you to go
into her undercover file

322
00:14:51,431 --> 00:14:52,799
with regards
to Vladimir Laitanan.

323
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,500
I need to know everything
that happened between them.

324
00:14:54,501 --> 00:14:55,835
I'll call you
right back.

325
00:14:55,836 --> 00:14:58,236
Okay, thanks.

326
00:15:05,212 --> 00:15:07,180
Mr. President.

327
00:15:07,181 --> 00:15:09,448
Your chief of staff said
it was urgent.

328
00:15:09,449 --> 00:15:11,317
It is, but first,

329
00:15:11,318 --> 00:15:15,188
I want to say again how thankful
we are that you're all right.

330
00:15:15,189 --> 00:15:17,657
If this is
about my security forces

331
00:15:17,658 --> 00:15:19,892
and the necessary steps

332
00:15:19,893 --> 00:15:23,062
I'm taking back home,
I'm afraid I can't help you.

333
00:15:25,332 --> 00:15:28,734
Are you so sure
they're necessary?

334
00:15:28,735 --> 00:15:31,537
What happened today
was nothing short of a coup.

335
00:15:31,538 --> 00:15:33,105
These same people are trying

336
00:15:33,106 --> 00:15:35,875
to restart my country's
nuclear weapons' program.

337
00:15:35,876 --> 00:15:37,510
I understand, but...

338
00:15:37,511 --> 00:15:38,811
No, I don't think you do.

339
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:41,380
Yours is an open society,
Madam President,

340
00:15:41,381 --> 00:15:44,083
governed by the rule of law.

341
00:15:44,084 --> 00:15:46,085
Mine is closed.

342
00:15:46,086 --> 00:15:49,222
The only real law is power.

343
00:15:49,223 --> 00:15:50,823
Any perceived

344
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:53,159
weakness on my part,
and I'm finished.

345
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,594
I'm aware of the complexities

346
00:15:54,595 --> 00:15:57,163
of your situation,
Mr. President.

347
00:15:57,164 --> 00:16:00,600
My brother tried to kill me,

348
00:16:00,601 --> 00:16:04,103
helped by elements
within my own government.

349
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:07,874
Those elements
must now be purged.

350
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:09,876
Purged?

351
00:16:09,877 --> 00:16:11,611
You mean, executed?

352
00:16:11,612 --> 00:16:14,881
It is the only thing
my people understand.

353
00:16:14,882 --> 00:16:17,617
I can't vouch for you
as a reformer, Mr. President,

354
00:16:17,618 --> 00:16:20,186
if you renege on your
human rights obligations.

355
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:24,123
The world is trusting you
because I trust you.

356
00:16:24,124 --> 00:16:26,525
You're asking me to show mercy
to enemies

357
00:16:26,526 --> 00:16:29,228
who are trying to destroy me.

358
00:16:29,229 --> 00:16:32,164
I am asking you
to find a middle way,

359
00:16:32,165 --> 00:16:34,166
in the name of bringing peace

360
00:16:34,167 --> 00:16:37,503
to a region that hasn't
known peace for generations.

361
00:16:43,143 --> 00:16:45,844
I need to see my family now.

362
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:06,265
I found a doctor.

363
00:17:06,266 --> 00:17:07,733
A doctor?

364
00:17:07,734 --> 00:17:10,937
Someone who can help you,
someone we can control,

365
00:17:10,938 --> 00:17:12,571
but Papa says
it's too risky.

366
00:17:12,572 --> 00:17:15,441
Papa's right.

367
00:17:15,442 --> 00:17:17,443
Condemning
you to death?

368
00:17:17,444 --> 00:17:19,879
I don't believe that.

369
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:23,683
What happened...
was my own fault.

370
00:17:23,684 --> 00:17:26,285
The family shouldn't have
to pay for my mistake.

371
00:17:26,286 --> 00:17:29,488
You know, all these years,
I thought it was an act.

372
00:17:29,489 --> 00:17:32,858
But you really are the good son,
aren't you?

373
00:17:34,962 --> 00:17:37,163
I'm no better or worse
than you, Josef.

374
00:17:37,164 --> 00:17:38,831
You're my older brother.

375
00:17:38,832 --> 00:17:41,700
You've always
looked out for me.

376
00:17:49,042 --> 00:17:50,476
What are you doing?

377
00:17:50,477 --> 00:17:52,878
Joseph? Joseph,
what are you doing?!

378
00:17:52,879 --> 00:17:54,113
I'm taking you
to the doctor.

379
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:55,715
But Papa said
we can't.

380
00:17:55,716 --> 00:17:57,283
I don't care what Papa said!

381
00:17:57,284 --> 00:18:01,128
I'm not letting you die
without a fight.

382
00:18:21,882 --> 00:18:25,584
You are old enough
to make your own decisions.

383
00:18:25,585 --> 00:18:26,786
I've decided to stay.

384
00:18:26,787 --> 00:18:28,654
As you wish.

385
00:18:28,655 --> 00:18:30,356
You should stay, too.

386
00:18:30,357 --> 00:18:31,624
I can't.

387
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:33,392
Why not?
You think that

388
00:18:33,393 --> 00:18:35,961
your father is one way, but

389
00:18:35,962 --> 00:18:37,229
he's not what
you think.

390
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:39,231
Stop doing that.

391
00:18:39,232 --> 00:18:40,733
You always
do that.
What?

392
00:18:40,734 --> 00:18:43,569
Imply things, but you never
actually tell me what you mean.

393
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:46,939
It is better that way, Kayla,
believe me.

394
00:18:48,275 --> 00:18:51,210
I don't want to poison you
against your father.

395
00:18:51,211 --> 00:18:54,346
There.
You're doing it again.

396
00:18:54,347 --> 00:18:55,714
You can't help yourself.

397
00:18:55,715 --> 00:18:57,783
Doing what again?

398
00:18:57,784 --> 00:18:59,118
Father!

399
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:00,619
Oh, are you all right?

400
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:01,821
I'm fine.

401
00:19:01,822 --> 00:19:03,155
We thought that...

402
00:19:03,156 --> 00:19:05,291
I know, I know.

403
00:19:05,292 --> 00:19:10,028
Kayla, I need to speak
to your mother now alone.

404
00:19:11,531 --> 00:19:13,931
Okay.

405
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:25,244
Dalia?

406
00:19:25,245 --> 00:19:27,112
We have nothing
to say to each other.

407
00:19:27,113 --> 00:19:29,513
Dalia, please.

408
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:32,451
Do you love her?

409
00:19:32,452 --> 00:19:34,220
It's over.

410
00:19:34,221 --> 00:19:35,821
I ended it.

411
00:19:35,822 --> 00:19:38,057
You didn't answer
the question.

412
00:19:38,058 --> 00:19:40,226
Be honest for once.

413
00:19:40,227 --> 00:19:41,727
Show me a little respect.

414
00:19:41,728 --> 00:19:44,496
I'm your wife, damn it.

415
00:19:44,497 --> 00:19:47,399
Do you love her?

416
00:19:49,836 --> 00:19:51,837
Maybe I thought I did.

417
00:19:51,838 --> 00:19:53,205
Then say it.

418
00:19:53,206 --> 00:19:55,875
What does it matter now?

419
00:19:55,876 --> 00:19:57,843
It matters to me.

420
00:19:57,844 --> 00:20:00,646
The truth is...

421
00:20:01,848 --> 00:20:05,885
...I'm just glad I could
still feel something, anything.

422
00:20:05,886 --> 00:20:08,854
And that's my fault somehow?
How dare you!

423
00:20:08,855 --> 00:20:10,489
Our fault.

424
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:12,925
There's enough blame
to go around.

425
00:20:12,926 --> 00:20:14,393
Dalia, please don't go.

426
00:20:14,394 --> 00:20:16,328
What?

427
00:20:16,329 --> 00:20:18,063
I don't want you to leave.

428
00:20:18,064 --> 00:20:21,467
Don't worry.

429
00:20:21,468 --> 00:20:24,236
I won't make a scene.

430
00:20:24,237 --> 00:20:28,073
You should know me better
than that by now.

431
00:20:28,074 --> 00:20:30,442
My brother's
a traitor.

432
00:20:30,443 --> 00:20:33,078
My highest officers are
conspiring against me.

433
00:20:33,079 --> 00:20:35,281
And now President Taylor

434
00:20:35,282 --> 00:20:38,050
is threatening to pull
out of the peace talks.

435
00:20:38,051 --> 00:20:42,187
It has been a long time
since you've asked my advice

436
00:20:42,188 --> 00:20:45,291
about anything.

437
00:20:45,292 --> 00:20:48,928
You were the one who always
gave me the best counsel.

438
00:20:48,929 --> 00:20:52,798
Thank you for remembering that.

439
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:55,300
Then you'll stay?

440
00:21:08,114 --> 00:21:10,949
It's too late for that, Omar.

441
00:21:12,585 --> 00:21:14,987
Too much has happened
between us.

442
00:21:14,988 --> 00:21:16,755
Dalia...

443
00:21:16,756 --> 00:21:19,458
I'm sorry.

444
00:21:44,718 --> 00:21:46,752
Vlad operates
t of here?

445
00:21:46,753 --> 00:21:48,220
Sometimes.

446
00:21:48,221 --> 00:21:49,955
He moved around a lot.

447
00:21:49,956 --> 00:21:52,358
That's why cops
don't find him inside here.

448
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:54,893
Come on, let's go.

449
00:21:54,894 --> 00:21:56,195
Hey, Ziya?

450
00:21:56,196 --> 00:21:57,429
Hmm?

451
00:21:57,430 --> 00:21:59,431
You know, Vladimir was
never fond of surprises,

452
00:21:59,432 --> 00:22:01,000
so I was thinking...

453
00:22:01,001 --> 00:22:03,635
maybe you could go in first?

454
00:22:03,636 --> 00:22:06,538
Get him used to the
idea of me again.

455
00:22:06,539 --> 00:22:08,507
Whet his appetite?

456
00:22:08,508 --> 00:22:10,509
Exactly.

457
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:12,910
Okay.

458
00:22:20,053 --> 00:22:21,553
Is our cover in place?

459
00:22:21,554 --> 00:22:23,122
Yeah. Chloe got me everything.

460
00:22:23,123 --> 00:22:25,357
Good. Let's start going over
what happened in Mexico City.

461
00:22:25,358 --> 00:22:27,059
How we met, who we dealt with.

462
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:28,460
First tell me about Vladimir.

463
00:22:28,461 --> 00:22:30,929
What do you want to know?

464
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:32,798
What he did to you?
I heard what Ziya said.

465
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:34,366
Ziya?

466
00:22:34,367 --> 00:22:36,402
Come on, Jack,
he's a drama queen.

467
00:22:36,403 --> 00:22:38,003
Damn it, Renee,
I am running this!

468
00:22:38,004 --> 00:22:39,238
Stop messing with me!

469
00:22:39,239 --> 00:22:40,572
I'm responsible for your safety.

470
00:22:40,573 --> 00:22:42,141
So, when I ask you
a straight queution,

471
00:22:42,142 --> 00:22:43,375
you give me a straight answer.

472
00:22:43,376 --> 00:22:45,044
Look, it was nothing, all right?

473
00:22:45,045 --> 00:22:47,713
I handled him six years ago,
I can handle him today.

474
00:22:47,714 --> 00:22:49,214
The only thing that
I am worried about

475
00:22:49,215 --> 00:22:50,616
is locking down this cover,
so, please,

476
00:22:50,617 --> 00:22:53,652
let's not waste another minute
on Vladimir.

477
00:22:53,653 --> 00:22:56,989
I'm a Munich-based arms dealer
named Ernst Meier.

478
00:22:56,990 --> 00:22:59,091
We met in Mexico City.

479
00:22:59,092 --> 00:23:02,494
You became my liaison
to the locals.

480
00:23:08,635 --> 00:23:11,503
Lugo.

481
00:23:11,504 --> 00:23:14,006
Long time.

482
00:23:14,007 --> 00:23:15,808
It's me, Ziya.

483
00:23:15,809 --> 00:23:17,810
I know who you are.

484
00:23:17,811 --> 00:23:19,578
Now what the hell
are you doing here?

485
00:23:19,579 --> 00:23:20,946
I've got business.

486
00:23:20,947 --> 00:23:22,815
Business?
Yeah.

487
00:23:22,816 --> 00:23:23,849
With Vladimir.

488
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:26,351
You've got business with me?

489
00:23:26,352 --> 00:23:28,287
Vlad!

490
00:23:28,288 --> 00:23:30,789
I should kill you for even
thinking of coming here.

491
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:31,824
What?

492
00:23:33,093 --> 00:23:35,828
Let me go, please!

493
00:23:35,829 --> 00:23:37,830
No, I...
Five years

494
00:23:37,831 --> 00:23:39,331
I've been living
underground.

495
00:23:39,332 --> 00:23:41,333
Five years! And now you walk
into my place of business?

496
00:23:41,334 --> 00:23:42,434
You're on probation!

497
00:23:42,435 --> 00:23:44,503
No. Not anymore, Vlad.

498
00:23:44,504 --> 00:23:46,505
Look.

499
00:23:46,506 --> 00:23:48,474
She get bracelet off.

500
00:23:48,475 --> 00:23:49,842
What are you talking about?
Who did?

501
00:23:49,843 --> 00:23:52,478
It's what I'm trying
to tell you. Renee.

502
00:23:52,479 --> 00:23:54,012
Renee Zadan.

503
00:23:54,013 --> 00:23:55,781
She come to my place

504
00:23:55,782 --> 00:23:57,015
looking for you.

505
00:23:57,016 --> 00:23:58,016
Yeah, she say

506
00:23:58,017 --> 00:23:59,017
she have buyer that

507
00:23:59,018 --> 00:24:00,119
you'd want to hear about.

508
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,587
That it'd be good for all of us.

509
00:24:01,588 --> 00:24:02,855
It'd be worth it for all of us.

510
00:24:02,856 --> 00:24:04,857
Renee.

511
00:24:04,858 --> 00:24:07,459
<i>Dah.</i>

512
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:09,628
She say where she'd been
these last five years?

513
00:24:09,629 --> 00:24:13,165
Uh, where everybody else was.

514
00:24:13,166 --> 00:24:14,166
In jail.

515
00:24:14,167 --> 00:24:15,801
Then she go to Mexico City.

516
00:24:15,802 --> 00:24:17,703
She say she got
the opportunity there.

517
00:24:17,704 --> 00:24:19,371
Mexico City, huh?

518
00:24:19,372 --> 00:24:22,374
<i>Dah.</i>
What do you think, Lugo?

519
00:24:22,375 --> 00:24:24,510
You believe this
piece of dirt?

520
00:24:24,511 --> 00:24:26,545
Sure I believe him.

521
00:24:26,546 --> 00:24:29,281
He's too stupid to make up
a story like that.

522
00:24:29,282 --> 00:24:30,649
It's her I don't believe.

523
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:31,683
I never did.

524
00:24:31,684 --> 00:24:33,485
I told you, Lugo, it wasn't her.

525
00:24:33,486 --> 00:24:34,686
She's not the one
who sold us out.

526
00:24:34,687 --> 00:24:36,688
She shows up out of the blue,

527
00:24:36,689 --> 00:24:40,225
then 16 months later,
the feds are down our throats.

528
00:24:41,194 --> 00:24:42,661
I'm just saying, Vlad.

529
00:24:42,662 --> 00:24:45,062
You were just saying.

530
00:24:50,803 --> 00:24:52,804
Where's Renee now?

531
00:24:52,805 --> 00:24:55,205
Outside.

532
00:24:57,377 --> 00:24:58,677
Clean yourself up.

533
00:24:58,678 --> 00:25:01,078
Bring her to me.

534
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:19,920
Arlo, where's Dana?

535
00:25:19,921 --> 00:25:21,955
She isn't at her desk.
She went home.

536
00:25:21,956 --> 00:25:23,390
Home?

537
00:25:23,391 --> 00:25:25,791
Yeah.

538
00:25:35,169 --> 00:25:36,503
Who is it?

539
00:25:36,504 --> 00:25:37,904
It's me.

540
00:25:37,905 --> 00:25:40,305
You have my key.

541
00:25:41,275 --> 00:25:43,744
Nice of you to drop by.

542
00:25:43,745 --> 00:25:46,146
It's not funny.

543
00:25:48,416 --> 00:25:49,683
What the hell?! Who's he?

544
00:25:49,684 --> 00:25:51,017
That's Nick.

545
00:25:51,018 --> 00:25:52,986
It's a buddy of mine
from Beaumont.

546
00:25:52,987 --> 00:25:55,021
Get him the hell out of here.

547
00:25:55,022 --> 00:25:57,023
You know I can't do that, Jen.

548
00:25:57,024 --> 00:25:59,025
I already told him
he could stay.

549
00:25:59,026 --> 00:26:01,828
It'd be impolite.

550
00:26:07,969 --> 00:26:10,370
Here.

551
00:26:10,371 --> 00:26:13,039
What's this?

552
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,274
It's $500.

553
00:26:14,275 --> 00:26:16,343
It's all I could get out
of the cash machine.

554
00:26:16,344 --> 00:26:18,845
I'll get you another
500 in the morning.

555
00:26:27,288 --> 00:26:30,290
You think you're smart,

556
00:26:30,291 --> 00:26:33,293
and the whole world's stupid.

557
00:26:33,294 --> 00:26:35,729
That's just not how it is, Jen.

558
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:37,631
I don't think you're stupid.

559
00:26:37,632 --> 00:26:40,734
No? But you think you can buy me
off with $1,000?

560
00:26:40,735 --> 00:26:42,102
I'm not trying
to buy you off.

561
00:26:42,103 --> 00:26:44,037
No, no.

562
00:26:44,038 --> 00:26:46,173
What do you want from me?

563
00:26:46,174 --> 00:26:48,341
You know what I want?

564
00:26:48,342 --> 00:26:50,210
What I really want

565
00:26:50,211 --> 00:26:52,279
is for you to stop treating me
like some dumbass,

566
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:55,549
19-year-old stickup artist
with a fast car!

567
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:59,486
You're not the only one
who's grown up.

568
00:26:59,487 --> 00:27:02,355
Easy, Kevin, easy.

569
00:27:02,356 --> 00:27:05,758
I've been waiting
for this moment.

570
00:27:06,928 --> 00:27:09,329
Dreaming about it.

571
00:27:10,665 --> 00:27:13,066
You owe me.

572
00:27:14,402 --> 00:27:18,571
If you think that I testified
against you, I didn't.

573
00:27:21,642 --> 00:27:23,443
Don't lie to me!

574
00:27:23,444 --> 00:27:25,145
I'm not lying to you!

575
00:27:25,146 --> 00:27:26,379
I got out of jail

576
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:27,380
before you did, yeah, but only

577
00:27:27,381 --> 00:27:28,381
because I went in as a minor.

578
00:27:28,382 --> 00:27:30,782
No other reason.

579
00:27:33,654 --> 00:27:35,322
The truth is,

580
00:27:35,323 --> 00:27:37,958
it doesn't change things,

581
00:27:37,959 --> 00:27:39,726
one way or another.

582
00:27:39,727 --> 00:27:41,461
See, I've done
my homework.

583
00:27:41,462 --> 00:27:43,863
I know what your job is.

584
00:27:45,299 --> 00:27:46,900
I'm a data analyst,
nothing more.

585
00:27:46,901 --> 00:27:49,336
Yeah, but you're a data analyst
for CTU.

586
00:27:49,337 --> 00:27:52,839
You got access to all sorts
of good stuff--

587
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:56,176
bank codes,
port authority manifests,

588
00:27:56,177 --> 00:27:58,211
stock exchange.

589
00:27:58,212 --> 00:28:00,714
Access, yeah, but not
unrestricted access.

590
00:28:00,715 --> 00:28:02,382
You'll figure something out.

591
00:28:02,383 --> 00:28:03,984
You always do.

592
00:28:03,985 --> 00:28:05,852
But whatever it is,

593
00:28:05,853 --> 00:28:09,289
the payout's got to be at least
six figures, okay?

594
00:28:20,167 --> 00:28:23,569
Please, Kevin.

595
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:33,580
Okay, here's the deal.

596
00:28:33,581 --> 00:28:37,417
You do this one thing for me,

597
00:28:37,418 --> 00:28:40,487
and I'm gone.

598
00:28:40,488 --> 00:28:43,890
I'll never bother you again.

599
00:28:45,526 --> 00:28:47,926
I can't.

600
00:28:55,236 --> 00:28:58,238
You can.

601
00:28:58,239 --> 00:29:00,940
And you will.

602
00:29:04,312 --> 00:29:06,446
Since last August, we've
been living and operating

603
00:29:06,447 --> 00:29:09,182
out of a hotel called
Bella Noche on Avenida Juarez.

604
00:29:09,183 --> 00:29:10,317
Can't they check that?

605
00:29:10,318 --> 00:29:11,484
Yeah, it's been set up
as a safe haven

606
00:29:11,485 --> 00:29:13,153
for high-end criminal activity.

607
00:29:13,154 --> 00:29:14,988
They don't keep records.
Have you got the name?

608
00:29:14,989 --> 00:29:17,123
Bella Noche. I got it.

609
00:29:17,124 --> 00:29:19,826
Okay, I'm going to be monitoring
you, filling in the details.

610
00:29:19,827 --> 00:29:21,027
Just listen to my voice.

611
00:29:21,028 --> 00:29:22,662
I'll get you all
the information you need.

612
00:29:22,663 --> 00:29:25,298
He's coming.

613
00:29:36,577 --> 00:29:38,978
Come on. Let's go.

614
00:29:50,091 --> 00:29:51,358
Yeah?

615
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:52,425
It's not pretty, Jack.

616
00:29:52,426 --> 00:29:53,860
She had a real problem
on her hands.

617
00:29:53,861 --> 00:29:55,295
Talk to me.

618
00:29:55,296 --> 00:29:56,529
According to the
responsible agent,

619
00:29:56,530 --> 00:29:58,198
Vladimir Laitanan was completely
obsessed with her.

620
00:29:58,199 --> 00:29:59,299
It turned violent.

621
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:00,300
How violent?

622
00:30:00,301 --> 00:30:02,302
Broken ribs, a busted cheekbone.

623
00:30:02,303 --> 00:30:04,304
A couple of trips
to the emergency room.

624
00:30:04,305 --> 00:30:05,605
Did he rape her?

625
00:30:05,606 --> 00:30:07,941
Not according
to these files,

626
00:30:07,942 --> 00:30:10,110
but it looks like he
tried a couple of times.

627
00:30:10,111 --> 00:30:12,946
Did she say anything about this
to you or Hastings?

628
00:30:12,947 --> 00:30:14,781
No.

629
00:30:14,782 --> 00:30:17,450
What's this about, Jack?

630
00:30:17,451 --> 00:30:19,452
Jack?

631
00:30:19,453 --> 00:30:22,455
The FBI tried to cover this up
as much as they could.

632
00:30:22,456 --> 00:30:24,124
But after she left the bureau,

633
00:30:24,125 --> 00:30:26,126
Renee went into a tailspin.

634
00:30:26,127 --> 00:30:28,995
She tried to kill herself at
least once that I know about.

635
00:30:28,996 --> 00:30:30,597
She says she's past it,
but I know she's not.

636
00:30:30,598 --> 00:30:32,132
I can see it in her eyes.

637
00:30:32,133 --> 00:30:34,167
You think she's purposely
putting herself in harm's way?

638
00:30:34,168 --> 00:30:36,836
I don't think she cares
what happens to her either way.

639
00:30:36,837 --> 00:30:38,838
Where is she now?
She's going in.

640
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:41,074
I'm going to put you on speaker.

641
00:30:48,449 --> 00:30:50,483
Hands up.

642
00:30:50,484 --> 00:30:52,885
Turn around.

643
00:31:02,196 --> 00:31:04,597
Go.

644
00:31:11,338 --> 00:31:13,773
Hello, Vlad.

645
00:31:15,409 --> 00:31:18,244
Renee.

646
00:31:18,245 --> 00:31:20,413
You changed your face.

647
00:31:20,414 --> 00:31:22,415
I had it done in Caracas.

648
00:31:22,416 --> 00:31:24,284
What do you think?

649
00:31:24,285 --> 00:31:26,086
Makes you look younger.

650
00:31:26,087 --> 00:31:27,887
I should get the name
of that doctor.

651
00:31:27,888 --> 00:31:29,923
He's not practicing anymore.

652
00:31:29,924 --> 00:31:31,958
A sad story.

653
00:31:31,959 --> 00:31:34,027
Our little friend here

654
00:31:34,028 --> 00:31:35,929
says you were
in Mexico City.

655
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:37,464
For what?

656
00:31:37,465 --> 00:31:39,132
Had some business.

657
00:31:39,133 --> 00:31:41,101
Good for you. I have
some contacts there myself.

658
00:31:41,102 --> 00:31:43,036
Yeah, I know you do.

659
00:31:43,037 --> 00:31:45,205
So...

660
00:31:45,206 --> 00:31:47,607
give me names.

661
00:31:53,914 --> 00:31:55,381
The Peralta-Rodriguez...

662
00:31:55,382 --> 00:31:56,850
Family.
Uh...

663
00:31:56,851 --> 00:31:58,885
The Peralta-Rodriguez family.

664
00:31:58,886 --> 00:32:00,286
Castorenas

665
00:32:00,287 --> 00:32:01,955
in Guadalajara.

666
00:32:01,956 --> 00:32:03,690
Ramon Jimenez.

667
00:32:03,691 --> 00:32:05,625
I know Ramon. Is his brother
Luiz still running

668
00:32:05,626 --> 00:32:07,627
their heroin operations?

669
00:32:07,628 --> 00:32:09,629
He was killed nine months ago
by the Federales.

670
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:13,366
Not since he was killed by
the Federales nine months ago.

671
00:32:13,367 --> 00:32:15,368
You know, Renee,

672
00:32:15,369 --> 00:32:18,371
now that you mention it,

673
00:32:18,372 --> 00:32:20,974
there is something different
about you, too.

674
00:32:20,975 --> 00:32:23,609
How do you mean?

675
00:32:25,246 --> 00:32:27,646
Your eyes.

676
00:32:28,716 --> 00:32:30,717
Your skin.

677
00:32:30,718 --> 00:32:32,285
You look like hell.

678
00:32:32,286 --> 00:32:36,088
Well, it's hard to look your
best with a gun in your face.

679
00:32:40,961 --> 00:32:43,329
No, that's not it.

680
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:45,598
Something else.

681
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:47,634
Have you been sick?

682
00:32:47,635 --> 00:32:50,336
No.

683
00:32:51,605 --> 00:32:55,074
Maybe you picked
up a little

684
00:32:55,075 --> 00:32:58,244
Hepatitis C
on your travels?

685
00:32:58,245 --> 00:33:00,680
Where were you staying
in Mexico City?

686
00:33:00,681 --> 00:33:02,649
The Bella.

687
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:04,584
Bella Noche Hotel.

688
00:33:04,585 --> 00:33:06,219
Bella Noche, naturally.

689
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:07,287
Then, of course,
you must know

690
00:33:07,288 --> 00:33:08,488
the government
official who allows it

691
00:33:08,489 --> 00:33:10,490
to operate without
police interference.

692
00:33:10,491 --> 00:33:11,724
Chloe, the hotel
in Mexico City--

693
00:33:11,725 --> 00:33:13,059
was there a local
politician on the take?

694
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:14,294
I don't have it here.
Neither do I.

695
00:33:14,295 --> 00:33:17,597
Checking DEA database.
Come on.

696
00:33:18,966 --> 00:33:20,333
Chloe.
Give me a minute.

697
00:33:20,334 --> 00:33:22,769
She doesn't
have a minute.

698
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:25,171
Waiting for a name!

699
00:33:25,172 --> 00:33:28,007
Go ahead, tell him.

700
00:33:29,076 --> 00:33:31,077
Really getting tired
of this, Vlad.

701
00:33:31,078 --> 00:33:33,246
His name!

702
00:33:33,247 --> 00:33:35,148
Got it-- Raul Castillo.

703
00:33:35,149 --> 00:33:37,550
Castillo,
Raul Castillo.

704
00:33:40,754 --> 00:33:44,023
Raul Castillo,
all right?

705
00:33:44,024 --> 00:33:46,792
Are we done playing
20 questions now?

706
00:33:52,333 --> 00:33:55,268
Yes, I believe
we are.

707
00:33:57,972 --> 00:34:00,440
You know, Renee, I
had almost forgotten

708
00:34:00,441 --> 00:34:01,541
how much fun
you are.

709
00:34:01,542 --> 00:34:03,209
You're not like
other women.

710
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:04,611
You have balls.

711
00:34:04,612 --> 00:34:08,781
Hmm, you always did say
the nicest things.

712
00:34:08,782 --> 00:34:11,684
Can we talk
about this deal now?

713
00:34:11,685 --> 00:34:14,320
I wish it were
that simple.

714
00:34:14,321 --> 00:34:16,356
Tie her up.

715
00:34:16,357 --> 00:34:18,024
What?

716
00:34:18,025 --> 00:34:20,260
Vlad, what are you doing?

717
00:34:20,261 --> 00:34:21,694
You gave me all the
right answers, Renee,

718
00:34:21,695 --> 00:34:22,962
but you're not
telling the truth.
You're making

719
00:34:22,963 --> 00:34:23,963
a mistake.

720
00:34:23,964 --> 00:34:25,465
This is the chance
of a lifetime.

721
00:34:25,466 --> 00:34:27,333
Him, too.

722
00:34:27,334 --> 00:34:28,534
Vlad, wait.

723
00:34:28,535 --> 00:34:31,370
Put them in the trunk.

724
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,975
Vladimir, Vladimir, no!

725
00:34:35,976 --> 00:34:37,310
No, Vladimir,
please don't do this!

726
00:34:37,311 --> 00:34:38,311
Listen to me!

727
00:34:38,312 --> 00:34:39,545
She come to me!

728
00:34:39,546 --> 00:34:40,613
She come to my place,

729
00:34:40,614 --> 00:34:41,614
the bitch!

730
00:34:41,615 --> 00:34:42,815
I swear!

731
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:44,617
Vladimir, I don't know
anything about this!

732
00:34:44,618 --> 00:34:47,018
No!

733
00:34:49,156 --> 00:34:51,157
Chloe, what the hell
just happened?

734
00:34:51,158 --> 00:34:54,227
They put her in the trunk,
I lost audio.

735
00:34:54,228 --> 00:34:55,728
Boosting the signal now.

736
00:34:55,729 --> 00:34:56,729
Renee?

737
00:34:56,730 --> 00:34:57,730
Try it again.

738
00:34:57,731 --> 00:34:58,965
Renee, can you hear me?

739
00:34:58,966 --> 00:35:00,733
Say something.

740
00:35:00,734 --> 00:35:01,801
Chloe, I don't have her.

741
00:35:01,802 --> 00:35:02,869
Then the car must be armored.

742
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:05,270
Either that
or her comm shorted out.

743
00:35:07,908 --> 00:35:10,376
Are you seeing this?

744
00:35:11,011 --> 00:35:13,679
I am.

745
00:35:28,028 --> 00:35:29,429
Okay, I'm following north

746
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:30,863
through an alley
towards Woodward.

747
00:35:30,864 --> 00:35:32,765
I think this operation
just blew up.

748
00:35:32,766 --> 00:35:34,701
Jack, are you planning
to intercept?

749
00:35:34,702 --> 00:35:35,702
Not if the car is armored.

750
00:35:35,703 --> 00:35:37,036
I'm gonna need tactical support.

751
00:35:37,037 --> 00:35:38,705
I'm alerting Hastings
to scramble a team now.

752
00:35:38,706 --> 00:35:40,573
Tell him I see four men
in the car,

753
00:35:40,574 --> 00:35:41,841
and we're going
to have to assume

754
00:35:41,842 --> 00:35:43,076
they're taking Renee somewhere
to kill her.

755
00:35:43,077 --> 00:35:44,077
Copy that.

756
00:35:44,078 --> 00:35:46,478
Damn it!

757
00:35:54,049 --> 00:35:55,767
Don't work too late, hon.

758
00:35:55,768 --> 00:35:56,868
Call me when you're on the road.

759
00:35:56,869 --> 00:35:57,869
Will do.

760
00:35:57,870 --> 00:36:00,038
Dr. Levine.

761
00:36:00,039 --> 00:36:01,472
How did you get in here?

762
00:36:01,473 --> 00:36:03,808
My brother is sick.

763
00:36:03,809 --> 00:36:05,777
I'm not seeing patients
right now.

764
00:36:05,778 --> 00:36:06,811
He needs your help.

765
00:36:06,812 --> 00:36:09,614
I'm gonna call you an ambulance.
No.

766
00:36:09,615 --> 00:36:12,717
No one else can know
about this.

767
00:36:14,186 --> 00:36:16,988
My men are outside your house
in New Rochelle.

768
00:36:16,989 --> 00:36:18,356
I don't believe you.

769
00:36:18,357 --> 00:36:19,824
I just spoke to my wife.

770
00:36:19,825 --> 00:36:21,659
We're outside the gate.

771
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:23,461
The address is
1614 Brook Street.

772
00:36:23,462 --> 00:36:25,396
The light in your
little daughter's room

773
00:36:25,397 --> 00:36:26,965
just went out
about ten minutes ago,

774
00:36:26,966 --> 00:36:29,167
so I want you
to put the phone down

775
00:36:29,168 --> 00:36:30,401
because you're not
going to try

776
00:36:30,402 --> 00:36:31,903
to warn anybody
about this.

777
00:36:31,904 --> 00:36:33,571
Do you understand?

778
00:36:33,572 --> 00:36:36,340
I understand.

779
00:36:40,045 --> 00:36:42,380
My brother has
radiation poisoning.

780
00:36:42,381 --> 00:36:43,881
He needs
treatment.

781
00:36:43,882 --> 00:36:47,118
His symptoms seem
quite advanced.

782
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:49,487
I'm not sure what it is
I can do for him.

783
00:36:49,488 --> 00:36:51,489
Well, you'd better be able
to do something,

784
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:53,091
for your family's sake.

785
00:36:53,092 --> 00:36:57,295
I, um... I need to know
what kind of materials

786
00:36:57,296 --> 00:36:58,863
he came in contact with.

787
00:36:58,864 --> 00:37:00,231
It was uranium.

788
00:37:00,232 --> 00:37:02,033
Do you know what variant,
the isotope?

789
00:37:02,034 --> 00:37:04,602
Weapons-grade 235.

790
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,614
Jack, this is Hastings.

791
00:37:16,615 --> 00:37:18,049
TAC teams are
three minutes away.

792
00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:20,218
All of them aware
that Renee is in the trunk?

793
00:37:20,219 --> 00:37:23,621
The instructions are
to engage only on my command.

794
00:37:23,622 --> 00:37:25,757
Any indication
where they're taking her?

795
00:37:25,758 --> 00:37:27,892
None.
Any percentage
in letting this play out?

796
00:37:27,893 --> 00:37:29,761
No. As soon as she's
out of the vehicle,

797
00:37:29,762 --> 00:37:31,396
she becomes that
much more vulnerable.

798
00:37:31,397 --> 00:37:33,464
If we engage now, it means
ending the operation.

799
00:37:33,465 --> 00:37:34,465
This operation's over.

800
00:37:34,466 --> 00:37:36,367
Vladimir didn't take the bait.

801
00:37:36,368 --> 00:37:38,903
Target just turned
south on Flushing.

802
00:37:38,904 --> 00:37:42,573
Jack, that's a feeder
onto the BQE in 2.6 miles.

803
00:37:42,574 --> 00:37:44,642
Mr. Hastings, if we don't engage
on these surface streets,

804
00:37:44,643 --> 00:37:46,277
we lose our tactical advantage.

805
00:37:46,278 --> 00:37:47,945
Chloe, get me an ETA.

806
00:37:47,946 --> 00:37:50,915
Intercept in...
two minutes, ten seconds.

807
00:37:50,916 --> 00:37:53,217
Sir, you need
to make the call now.

808
00:37:53,218 --> 00:37:55,887
All right, I'm
authorizing engagement.

809
00:37:55,888 --> 00:37:58,288
Stand by
for intercept protocols.

810
00:37:59,892 --> 00:38:02,293
This is good. Pull over.

811
00:38:20,145 --> 00:38:22,545
Open it.

812
00:38:23,282 --> 00:38:25,283
Vladimir.
Take them out
of the trunk.

813
00:38:25,284 --> 00:38:27,151
Lugo, please, you tell him,
tell Vladimir...

814
00:38:27,152 --> 00:38:28,986
Chloe, I've got
a signal again.

815
00:38:28,987 --> 00:38:30,688
Please, Vladimir, Vlad...

816
00:38:30,689 --> 00:38:32,423
Something's wrong--
they definitely sound stopped,

817
00:38:32,424 --> 00:38:33,758
but the vehicle
I'm following

818
00:38:33,759 --> 00:38:35,326
is still going south
on Flushing.

819
00:38:35,327 --> 00:38:37,562
She told me to come to you!
Shut up, shut up, Ziya.

820
00:38:37,563 --> 00:38:38,863
It's not going to do any good.

821
00:38:38,864 --> 00:38:41,332
Confirming that, Jack,
the target is still moving.

822
00:38:41,333 --> 00:38:43,167
Chloe, we're following a decoy.

823
00:38:43,168 --> 00:38:45,236
They must have left
in another vehicle. Find it!

824
00:38:45,237 --> 00:38:47,572
Okay, pulling up
a satellite footage.

825
00:38:47,573 --> 00:38:48,639
All right, TAC teams,

826
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,575
hold your positions,
stand by.
Jack,

827
00:38:50,576 --> 00:38:53,077
another car drove out of the
back of the auto parts building

828
00:38:53,078 --> 00:38:54,479
five minutes
after the first one.

829
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,613
Are you kidding me?!

830
00:38:55,614 --> 00:38:56,681
I'm sorry, we were focusing

831
00:38:56,682 --> 00:38:58,082
everything on your follow.

832
00:38:58,083 --> 00:38:59,450
Just tell me where they are!

833
00:38:59,451 --> 00:39:01,851
Take them down to the water.

834
00:39:20,072 --> 00:39:21,305
Okay, I've got a GPS lock
on Renee.

835
00:39:21,306 --> 00:39:23,708
They're pulled off
at Newtown Creek,

836
00:39:23,709 --> 00:39:25,843
just south
of Bryne Memorial Bridge.

837
00:39:25,844 --> 00:39:27,345
Where are the TAC teams?
I'm redirecting them now.

838
00:39:27,346 --> 00:39:28,679
How far out are they?

839
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:30,515
At least ten minutes.
Tell them to move it.

840
00:39:30,516 --> 00:39:32,283
Put me back on to Renee's comm.
Damn it!

841
00:39:34,553 --> 00:39:37,255
Renee, it's Jack.

842
00:39:37,256 --> 00:39:38,256
I know you can hear me.

843
00:39:38,257 --> 00:39:39,423
Vladimir had us
following a decoy.

844
00:39:39,424 --> 00:39:41,292
TAC teams are
ten minutes out.

845
00:39:41,293 --> 00:39:42,326
I'm on my way now.

846
00:39:42,327 --> 00:39:45,129
Do whatever you have to
to buy time.

847
00:39:46,965 --> 00:39:49,033
On your knees,
both of you.

848
00:39:49,034 --> 00:39:51,569
Please listen to me,
I don't know anything.

849
00:39:51,570 --> 00:39:54,405
Shut your mouth.

850
00:39:55,307 --> 00:39:57,241
I'm going to give you
one last chance

851
00:39:57,242 --> 00:40:00,711
to tell me what is going on.

852
00:40:00,712 --> 00:40:05,082
Vladimir,
I swear on my life,
she come to my place.

853
00:40:05,083 --> 00:40:06,918
I don't know
anything.

854
00:40:08,754 --> 00:40:09,921
No!

855
00:40:09,922 --> 00:40:11,489
Renee.

856
00:40:11,490 --> 00:40:14,225
Renee?!

857
00:40:14,226 --> 00:40:16,260
Amazing.

858
00:40:16,261 --> 00:40:18,662
You didn't even blink.

859
00:40:29,241 --> 00:40:31,676
Go ahead.

860
00:40:31,677 --> 00:40:33,678
Just get it over with.

861
00:40:33,679 --> 00:40:36,447
Renee, what the
hell are you doing?

862
00:40:36,448 --> 00:40:37,682
Not yet.

863
00:40:37,683 --> 00:40:41,118
For God's sake,
don't make me grovel.

864
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:43,120
Just pull
the damn trigger.

865
00:40:43,121 --> 00:40:45,256
First I want
to hear the truth.

866
00:40:45,257 --> 00:40:46,924
I want to know
who you really are.

867
00:40:50,929 --> 00:40:52,129
Who I really am?

868
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:55,600
Yeah, who you are,
not a game, Renee...

869
00:40:55,601 --> 00:40:58,002
or whatever your name is.

870
00:40:58,637 --> 00:41:02,106
Fine, you want the truth?

871
00:41:02,107 --> 00:41:04,642
I'll tell you the truth.

872
00:41:06,345 --> 00:41:08,613
You were right.

873
00:41:08,614 --> 00:41:11,582
You were right, I am sick.

874
00:41:11,583 --> 00:41:14,051
I am so sick
of living like this.

875
00:41:15,988 --> 00:41:20,091
The truth is...

876
00:41:20,092 --> 00:41:22,727
even if you let me walk
right now...

877
00:41:22,728 --> 00:41:27,564
I have nowhere to go
and no one to go to.

878
00:41:33,105 --> 00:41:35,106
You don't want to do this deal,

879
00:41:35,107 --> 00:41:37,642
fine.

880
00:41:37,643 --> 00:41:39,710
Then you might as well
just kill me

881
00:41:39,711 --> 00:41:43,881
because this deal is
the only thing that I have.

882
00:41:43,882 --> 00:41:46,684
Renee, please don't
do this, please.

883
00:41:46,685 --> 00:41:48,419
Besides, you wouldn't
be doing anything

884
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:51,155
that I haven't already
tried myself.

885
00:41:54,359 --> 00:41:56,360
Do it.

886
00:41:56,361 --> 00:41:58,761
Do it!

887
00:41:59,631 --> 00:42:02,199
Pull the trigger!

888
00:42:14,646 --> 00:42:16,647
I had to be sure.

889
00:42:20,152 --> 00:42:22,687
You understand,
right?

890
00:42:22,688 --> 00:42:25,523
Yes.

891
00:42:25,524 --> 00:42:29,393
Good... good.

892
00:42:31,196 --> 00:42:33,597
Dump him in the river.

893
00:42:46,511 --> 00:42:48,846
Jack, TAC teams are
almost there.

894
00:42:48,847 --> 00:42:51,415
I need a status update.

895
00:42:53,352 --> 00:42:54,785
Jack, are you there?

896
00:42:54,786 --> 00:42:56,120
Do you copy?

897
00:42:56,121 --> 00:42:58,356
You tell the TAC teams
to stand down.

898
00:42:58,357 --> 00:43:00,024
What's going on?

899
00:43:00,025 --> 00:43:01,726
She's in.

900
00:43:01,727 --> 00:43:04,995
They bought her cover.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
