1
00:00:14,265 --> 00:00:17,498
- Have you got it yet?
- I told you I'd call when I have everything.

2
00:00:17,587 --> 00:00:20,102
I'm paying you a lot of money, Collette.

3
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:25,106
If you could've got the specs of a facility this
secure from someone else, you would have.

4
00:00:25,511 --> 00:00:27,389
CTU is no longer an obstacle.

5
00:00:27,873 --> 00:00:33,109
<i>This facility has been contaminated
with Sentox VX-1 nerve gas. I repeat...</i>

6
00:00:33,196 --> 00:00:35,347
Move, people.

7
00:00:35,437 --> 00:00:37,588
In the situation room. Now. Seal it.

8
00:00:38,358 --> 00:00:42,274
<i>Lynn, it's Jack. We found
a computer interrupt in the AC control.</i>

9
00:00:42,361 --> 00:00:46,481
If we shut that down in the next few minutes,
we can stop the gas permeating safe zones.

10
00:00:46,563 --> 00:00:48,920
<i>You're the only person
close enough to get to it.</i>

11
00:00:49,365 --> 00:00:53,440
Lynn, the truth is if I could get there, I would
do this myself, but I'm not close enough.

12
00:00:53,528 --> 00:00:56,806
<i>But I'm gonna have to ask you
to do it without any protection.</i>

13
00:01:00,171 --> 00:01:01,241
He did it.

14
00:01:07,695 --> 00:01:12,089
CTU is protecting this city. Are you saying
they're no longer capable of doing that?

15
00:01:12,178 --> 00:01:13,897
They've been seriously compromised.

16
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:18,213
We've got terrorists with nerve gas out there.
Who will stop them?

17
00:01:18,302 --> 00:01:21,501
Mr. President,
I suggest an emergency restructuring.

18
00:01:21,583 --> 00:01:23,974
CTU is no longer an operational entity.

19
00:01:24,065 --> 00:01:26,500
It's a building with workers
who will report to us.

20
00:01:26,786 --> 00:01:30,577
I can see no other option but to impose
martial law on the city of Los Angeles.

21
00:01:30,669 --> 00:01:33,503
What I will not do is stand by

22
00:01:33,591 --> 00:01:37,506
and watch Hal Gardner use you
to promote his own agenda.

23
00:01:37,873 --> 00:01:41,390
You killed my wife,
Michelle Dessler, this morning.

24
00:01:41,475 --> 00:01:45,311
She was my life, and you took her.

25
00:01:45,398 --> 00:01:48,072
He's got a gun. You can't do this.

26
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,474
<i>We have to get him talking. He's our only lead
to Bierko and the rest of the Sentox canisters.</i>

27
00:01:52,922 --> 00:01:56,040
- You've had your chance. He's mine now.
- Tony!

28
00:02:29,303 --> 00:02:31,977
- I am so sorry.
- Has security found Henderson yet?

29
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:34,978
No, he got out of the building
before the lockdown.

30
00:02:35,066 --> 00:02:39,061
An external cam got a shot of him leaving.
His car was found a block away.

31
00:02:39,148 --> 00:02:42,347
- But I think we got what we need.
- What are you talking about?

32
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:46,904
Chloe decrypted a file from his computer.
She found someone connected to Bierko.

33
00:02:46,993 --> 00:02:48,551
Who is Collette Stenger?

34
00:02:48,634 --> 00:02:52,515
She's an intelligence broker.
State secrets, intellectual property.

35
00:02:52,596 --> 00:02:57,194
- What's her connection to Bierko?
- They met twice over the last eight months.

36
00:02:57,279 --> 00:02:59,748
And we think she brokered the deal.
Is she in LA?

37
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,198
She gave a hotel name to customs,
but nothing to say she's there.

38
00:03:03,282 --> 00:03:05,274
Curtis is prepping a tactical team.

39
00:03:05,363 --> 00:03:07,355
OK, good work.

40
00:03:08,446 --> 00:03:11,405
Manning.

41
00:03:11,487 --> 00:03:13,843
- When is the tac team leaving?
- Right now.

42
00:03:13,929 --> 00:03:15,522
- I'm going with you.
- All right.

43
00:03:20,772 --> 00:03:23,368
Ladies and gentlemen,
members of the press,

44
00:03:23,454 --> 00:03:28,736
just so you're aware, there will be no Q and A
following the president's statement...

45
00:03:29,298 --> 00:03:31,653
Are you having second thoughts?

46
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:35,776
Putting soldiers on the streets of LA -
this will not be popular.

47
00:03:35,861 --> 00:03:37,978
Maybe not, but it's the right move.

48
00:03:38,062 --> 00:03:39,816
Hal, would you excuse us, please?

49
00:03:39,903 --> 00:03:43,023
Mrs. Logan, the president's
about to go on the air.

50
00:03:43,105 --> 00:03:45,018
I'll be brief.

51
00:03:45,107 --> 00:03:48,657
I would like a moment alone
with my husband.

52
00:03:54,712 --> 00:03:57,705
I've made up my mind.
I'm not debating this any more.

53
00:03:57,794 --> 00:04:01,026
Listen, please.
Mike Novick spoke to someone at CTU.

54
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:05,509
They have a lead on Bierko and they may
find him before he launches another attack.

55
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:09,673
CTU was just hit. 40% % of their people
are either dead or unable to work.

56
00:04:09,761 --> 00:04:12,640
To think they could stop this
is just wishful thinking.

57
00:04:12,722 --> 00:04:14,475
Maybe not.

58
00:04:15,604 --> 00:04:18,757
Bringing the military in
is the best way to maintain order.

59
00:04:18,846 --> 00:04:21,077
The vice president's right about that.

60
00:04:21,167 --> 00:04:23,636
Of course he is.

61
00:04:23,729 --> 00:04:25,925
What does that mean?

62
00:04:26,009 --> 00:04:30,723
Has it ever occurred to you that he proposed
this whole thing to set you up for a fall?

63
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:33,851
- So he gets the nomination next year.
- That's insane.

64
00:04:33,935 --> 00:04:37,725
Hal's only motivation
is what's best for the country.

65
00:04:37,816 --> 00:04:39,774
There's going to be fallout.

66
00:04:40,338 --> 00:04:43,890
Hal knows it and you know it.

67
00:04:43,981 --> 00:04:45,813
Mr. President.

68
00:04:48,783 --> 00:04:51,583
- I have to go.
- Charles.

69
00:04:51,665 --> 00:04:56,297
Ladies and gentlemen,
the President of the United States.

70
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:06,509
As you all know, America has been hit today
by a series of terrorist strikes,

71
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:10,555
beginning with the assassination
of former president David Palmer

72
00:05:10,635 --> 00:05:13,674
and the murder
of innocent Americans at Ontario airport,

73
00:05:13,758 --> 00:05:17,753
followed by the attempted assassination
of President Yuri Suvarov.

74
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,314
These events are being orchestrated
by terrorists operating within our borders.

75
00:05:22,403 --> 00:05:28,754
Our most recent intelligence suggests
that they will strike again and soon.

76
00:05:28,847 --> 00:05:31,408
I can and will do my sworn duty

77
00:05:31,487 --> 00:05:34,562
to ensure the safety of the American people.

78
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:38,483
Therefore, I am issuing an executive order

79
00:05:38,572 --> 00:05:44,445
imposing a curfew on all civilians
in the Los Angeles metropolitan area.

80
00:05:44,535 --> 00:05:49,453
This curfew will be effective immediately
and will be enforced by the military.

81
00:05:49,538 --> 00:05:53,089
<i>As disruptive and distasteful
as I know this is for many of you,</i>

82
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:59,259
<i>I ask that you remember that we are at war.
Bracing ourselves against future attacks...</i>

83
00:05:59,343 --> 00:06:02,895
DOD is asking
for a list of our casualties.

84
00:06:02,986 --> 00:06:08,347
I don't want any names released
until the next of kin have been notified.

85
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:12,424
- Let me know when that happens.
- OK.

86
00:06:15,953 --> 00:06:20,666
This place is a sinking ship. We should
take over now, not go through an assessment.

87
00:06:20,756 --> 00:06:24,034
Until we transition,
we need everyone here functioning.

88
00:06:24,118 --> 00:06:29,559
Once the canisters have been found and the
terrorists captured, then we'll assume control.

89
00:06:29,642 --> 00:06:31,679
- Karen.
- Hello, Bill.

90
00:06:31,762 --> 00:06:33,720
Bill Buchanan, Miles Papazian.

91
00:06:33,803 --> 00:06:37,594
Your coming wasn't necessary.
We just need to replace some personnel.

92
00:06:37,686 --> 00:06:41,237
We're sorry, but the White House
feels you may need more than that.

93
00:06:41,327 --> 00:06:45,721
They want an assessment
of how Homeland may best assist CTU.

94
00:06:48,372 --> 00:06:50,842
- I'll brief you in my office.
- Fine.

95
00:06:50,934 --> 00:06:54,325
Familiarise yourself
with the networks and start the survey.

96
00:06:54,415 --> 00:06:56,612
- Let's go.
- Upstairs.

97
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,172
- Chloe O'Brian?
- Who are you?

98
00:07:05,262 --> 00:07:07,936
- Homeland Security.
- I asked your name.

99
00:07:08,023 --> 00:07:11,142
- I need a vacant station set up.
- I'm kind of busy right now.

100
00:07:11,226 --> 00:07:15,824
I'm seeing Edgar Stiles
listed on my report as a casualty.

101
00:07:17,909 --> 00:07:20,505
Is that right?

102
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:22,627
Yeah.

103
00:07:22,712 --> 00:07:26,673
Then his station should be available.
I'll set up over there.

104
00:07:26,754 --> 00:07:30,716
I'll be reinstalling operating protocols
so I'll need your key card.

105
00:07:30,796 --> 00:07:32,867
No.

106
00:07:33,718 --> 00:07:36,439
- I'm sorry?
- You can't have my key card.

107
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:43,199
We're here with a priority admin directive.
You can confirm that on your own time.

108
00:07:58,933 --> 00:08:01,892
<i>We're live in Los Angeles.
A few minutes ago,</i>

109
00:08:01,975 --> 00:08:06,687
<i>army units stationed in LA County
began moving in force across city limits.</i>

110
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:09,976
<i>This is the first time
a military presence of this scale</i>

111
00:08:10,059 --> 00:08:13,019
<i>has been activated
in a major metropolitan area.</i>

112
00:08:13,101 --> 00:08:17,255
<i>While White House officials have
stopped short of officially declaring...</i>

113
00:08:17,343 --> 00:08:21,134
- Where are you going?
- I just need some fresh air.

114
00:08:21,226 --> 00:08:26,383
<i>These divisions were activated
shortly after the president's press conference,</i>

115
00:08:26,468 --> 00:08:28,460
<i>in which he declared...</i>

116
00:08:30,911 --> 00:08:34,622
- I do not trust him.
- Ma'am?

117
00:08:34,713 --> 00:08:37,103
The vice president.

118
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:48,794
- This is Aaron Pierce.
- Aaron, it's Wayne Palmer.

119
00:08:51,883 --> 00:08:55,275
Sir, I am so sorry about President Palmer.

120
00:08:55,365 --> 00:08:57,927
<i>More sorry than I can describe.</i>

121
00:08:58,007 --> 00:09:01,479
I know you were close to my brother.
He felt the same way about you.

122
00:09:01,569 --> 00:09:03,606
Thank you for saying that.

123
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:08,608
He's the reason I'm calling. There's something
from my brother I need to give you.

124
00:09:08,693 --> 00:09:11,368
- I'll be there in an hour.
- You're coming here?

125
00:09:11,455 --> 00:09:14,574
It sounds impulsive,
but I'd rather see you sooner than later.

126
00:09:14,656 --> 00:09:18,857
- Well, there's a curfew in effect, sir.
- I know. I left before it was declared.

127
00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:22,532
If I may say so, this is an odd request.

128
00:09:22,621 --> 00:09:25,581
Aaron, my brother trusted you with his life.

129
00:09:25,663 --> 00:09:29,214
- I am asking you to trust me.
- All right.

130
00:09:29,305 --> 00:09:32,343
I'd also appreciate it
if you would keep this between us.

131
00:09:32,427 --> 00:09:35,421
I'm hoping there's somewhere
we can meet discreetly.

132
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:39,298
- I'll find a place.
- Thank you. I'll call you when I'm close.

133
00:09:45,354 --> 00:09:50,351
<i>The effects of this will ripple
across the country as other cities take note.</i>

134
00:09:50,437 --> 00:09:55,309
<i>While legislators debate the legality
of President Logan's action, martial law is...</i>

135
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:57,596
Mike, turn it off.

136
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:04,473
"Debate the legality of
President Logan's action. " Did you hear that?

137
00:10:04,565 --> 00:10:08,037
They're talking about this
like it's an illegal action.

138
00:10:08,127 --> 00:10:12,681
Don't worry, Mr. President.
I'm in control of the situation.

139
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:16,526
Our legal people are working on it right now.

140
00:10:21,334 --> 00:10:24,328
Do we have anything more from CTU?

141
00:10:24,417 --> 00:10:27,091
They're still following up on this Bierko lead.

142
00:10:27,178 --> 00:10:32,700
As soon as they have something to report,
we'll be the first to hear.

143
00:10:35,983 --> 00:10:38,704
Give me details
of the current threat assessment.

144
00:10:38,785 --> 00:10:43,258
There's a high probability that Bierko
is planning an attack on a much larger scale.

145
00:10:43,347 --> 00:10:47,423
That's why he targeted CTU,
to cripple our ability to stop him.

146
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:50,150
And the question is, was he successful?

147
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:53,464
Looking at the numbers,
you were harder hit than you thought.

148
00:10:53,554 --> 00:10:55,704
We're still functioning - not at 100% %,

149
00:10:55,794 --> 00:10:59,267
but with the people I've asked for
we'll be back to fighting strength.

150
00:10:59,356 --> 00:11:01,269
Any progress finding Bierko?

151
00:11:01,358 --> 00:11:05,035
We've identified a woman
who might lead us to him - Collette Stenger.

152
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,275
- We've just sent a tac team to bring her in.
- Good.

153
00:11:15,526 --> 00:11:20,523
I enjoy watching you get dressed almost as
much as I enjoy watching you get undressed.

154
00:11:20,609 --> 00:11:24,729
You should get dressed yourself
and send the bags down.

155
00:11:24,811 --> 00:11:29,171
This deal you're working on -
I hope you're getting a lot of money for it.

156
00:11:29,254 --> 00:11:31,166
I never talk about my business.

157
00:11:31,255 --> 00:11:34,772
I know, but Maria called
about this villa in Positano.

158
00:11:34,857 --> 00:11:37,532
She said when you see it, you'll love it.

159
00:11:37,619 --> 00:11:40,009
We'll call her later.

160
00:11:44,823 --> 00:11:47,099
I'll see you at the airport, OK?

161
00:11:47,184 --> 00:11:49,255
In 45 minutes.

162
00:11:49,345 --> 00:11:51,258
I'll be there.

163
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:00,748
- Yes.
- I'm on my way.

164
00:12:00,832 --> 00:12:03,553
- And you have everything I asked for?
- Of course.

165
00:12:03,634 --> 00:12:05,830
- Good.
- Do you have the money?

166
00:12:05,915 --> 00:12:09,353
When I verify the merchandise,
I'll transfer it to your account.

167
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:11,508
I'll be there soon.

168
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:18,752
- Does she have the schematics and codes?
- Yes. Everything we need.

169
00:12:18,842 --> 00:12:21,438
The distribution centre is a difficult target.

170
00:12:21,524 --> 00:12:24,119
It would be easier
to hit a less secure location.

171
00:12:24,205 --> 00:12:27,405
No, Mikhail, this is the place.

172
00:12:27,487 --> 00:12:31,085
We'll release the Sentox here...

173
00:12:31,169 --> 00:12:33,810
and 200,000 people die.

174
00:12:50,981 --> 00:12:55,295
And we need a second satellite repositioned
as soon as possible. Good. Thank you.

175
00:12:55,384 --> 00:13:00,415
I saw a request for proficiency evaluations for
all CTU personnel on my secondary screen.

176
00:13:00,507 --> 00:13:03,500
That's a formality.
We don't have time for evaluations.

177
00:13:03,588 --> 00:13:06,662
- Why was it put in the pipeline?
- It's a formality.

178
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:10,904
You're shutting us down, aren't you?
The evaluations will be filled in later.

179
00:13:10,992 --> 00:13:15,352
- I told you before, the White House...
- I know what you told me before.

180
00:13:15,435 --> 00:13:17,313
Now tell me the truth.

181
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:25,874
The truth is,
CTU is being absorbed by Homeland,

182
00:13:25,961 --> 00:13:30,036
which means from now on every
operational decision needs to go through me.

183
00:13:30,124 --> 00:13:35,201
What did you expect? 56 of your people
have been killed. The others are demoralised.

184
00:13:35,286 --> 00:13:38,884
They're not demoralised.
They're angry. They want to fight back.

185
00:13:38,968 --> 00:13:44,490
- They're willing to lay down their lives.
- It's done, Bill. The decision's been made.

186
00:13:44,572 --> 00:13:48,487
Neither of us wants this transition
to interfere with ongoing protocols,

187
00:13:48,574 --> 00:13:50,646
so let's just keep it between us,

188
00:13:50,736 --> 00:13:54,047
at least until this crisis plays out.

189
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:08,378
Bill.

190
00:14:09,827 --> 00:14:13,708
Homeland is being overly aggressive
with their survey. What is going on?

191
00:14:13,789 --> 00:14:16,624
Nothing. It's just a formality.

192
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:20,626
They'll be gone
as soon as they finish their evaluation.

193
00:14:20,713 --> 00:14:23,627
Where are we on the military mobilisation?

194
00:14:24,715 --> 00:14:27,868
Martial law is in effect
in nine of the 15 LA districts.

195
00:14:27,957 --> 00:14:31,474
I'm setting up checkpoints
for the rest of the county now.

196
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:35,190
I hope the president's doing the right thing.

197
00:14:45,927 --> 00:14:48,727
Alpha team,
we're approaching Stenger's room.

198
00:14:48,808 --> 00:14:52,884
<i>- We're ready to move. Are you in position?
- We've got the lobby covered.</i>

199
00:14:52,971 --> 00:14:55,043
All right. Copy.

200
00:15:29,992 --> 00:15:33,351
I think she went for the roof. Cover the stairs.

201
00:15:35,355 --> 00:15:38,235
Let's go. We're going up top.

202
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:37,906
Drop the gun!

203
00:16:37,992 --> 00:16:40,188
Stand down or he dies!

204
00:16:45,036 --> 00:16:46,993
I said stand down!

205
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:54,870
Our people are all around you. They will
drop you before you can pull that trigger.

206
00:16:54,961 --> 00:16:56,999
Put the gun down.

207
00:16:57,763 --> 00:17:02,635
- What do you mean? Who are you?
- Counter Terrorist Unit, Los Angeles.

208
00:17:05,568 --> 00:17:07,958
Show me identification.

209
00:17:17,935 --> 00:17:21,485
I'm with the German
Federal Intelligence Service.

210
00:17:21,577 --> 00:17:24,571
My name's Theo Stoller.

211
00:17:24,659 --> 00:17:27,892
- What are you doing here?
- I'm here on special assignment.

212
00:17:27,981 --> 00:17:30,450
By agreement between our governments.

213
00:17:30,542 --> 00:17:33,183
Get the hell out of here
before you destroy my cover.

214
00:17:33,264 --> 00:17:35,301
That's not gonna happen.

215
00:17:42,028 --> 00:17:43,509
<i>- O'Brian.
- It's Jack.</i>

216
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:47,346
I want you to check on a foreign agent
on the SA list - Theo Stoller.

217
00:17:47,432 --> 00:17:48,866
OK.

218
00:17:51,554 --> 00:17:55,345
Got it. Theo Stoller.
Height - 5'11", brown hair, brown eyes.

219
00:17:55,437 --> 00:17:58,635
He's a German operative,
but trained in England at Ml6.

220
00:17:58,719 --> 00:18:02,713
- There's even contact information.
- Chloe, that's enough, thanks.

221
00:18:03,841 --> 00:18:08,281
- I told you. You have to get out of here.
- We can't. You were with Collette Stenger.

222
00:18:08,364 --> 00:18:11,517
- We need her to help us find Vladimir Bierko.
- I don't know him.

223
00:18:11,606 --> 00:18:14,680
He's responsible
for the terrorist attacks today.

224
00:18:14,768 --> 00:18:18,763
He's preparing another one.
Collette Stenger is the only way to find him.

225
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:21,161
Where is she?

226
00:18:21,252 --> 00:18:23,687
- I can't help you.
- Why not?

227
00:18:23,773 --> 00:18:28,327
- Giving you her jeopardises my operation.
- What operation?

228
00:18:28,415 --> 00:18:34,210
I've been gathering intel on her clientele.
We've identified cells in three countries.

229
00:18:34,298 --> 00:18:37,611
She's connected to a dozen more.
She's too valuable to give up.

230
00:18:37,701 --> 00:18:41,777
If we don't find Bierko, hundreds
of thousands of innocent people will die.

231
00:18:41,863 --> 00:18:44,298
That is more important than your operation.

232
00:18:44,385 --> 00:18:47,857
It's not about importance.
It's about different agendas.

233
00:18:47,947 --> 00:18:52,898
Your job is to save American lives,
mine to save German lives.

234
00:18:52,989 --> 00:18:56,222
You're asking me
to betray my duty to my country.

235
00:18:56,312 --> 00:18:58,588
Ask yourself what you'd do in my position.

236
00:18:58,673 --> 00:19:01,394
You better ask yourself
what you would do in mine.

237
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:04,752
- Let's go.
- I'm here by permission. You can't touch me.

238
00:19:04,837 --> 00:19:07,147
Right. We'll see about that.

239
00:20:00,789 --> 00:20:03,988
Make sure your superior knows
that if this attack happens,

240
00:20:04,071 --> 00:20:07,304
my government will hold
your country accountable.

241
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:11,145
Jack, it's Buchanan.
Audrey will be joining us momentarily.

242
00:20:11,236 --> 00:20:14,593
You're on the line with Karen Hayes
from Homeland Security.

243
00:20:14,678 --> 00:20:18,149
She's supporting CTU.
She's been in contact with the White House.

244
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,549
Did the president
contact the German chancellor?

245
00:20:20,641 --> 00:20:24,602
- He's unreachable for another hour.
- We don't have another hour.

246
00:20:24,683 --> 00:20:29,237
- There's nothing we can do.
- Jack, I just spoke with German intelligence.

247
00:20:29,326 --> 00:20:32,478
They're refusing
to order their agent to cooperate with us.

248
00:20:32,567 --> 00:20:35,367
- Maybe you can get a deal with him.
- I'll talk to him.

249
00:20:35,449 --> 00:20:38,682
- Call me if you get him to change his mind.
- Yeah.

250
00:20:38,771 --> 00:20:40,569
Curtis.

251
00:20:43,694 --> 00:20:46,290
- Give me a moment with him.
- What are you doing?

252
00:20:46,376 --> 00:20:48,173
It's all right.

253
00:20:49,417 --> 00:20:50,976
All right.

254
00:20:51,059 --> 00:20:53,051
Let's go.

255
00:20:57,222 --> 00:21:02,982
Your intelligence service denied our request
for cooperation. So has your government.

256
00:21:03,065 --> 00:21:06,696
I'm not surprised.
Collette Stenger's a golden goose.

257
00:21:06,787 --> 00:21:08,904
There's no upside in giving her up.

258
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:13,749
Maybe I could provide you with one.

259
00:21:16,312 --> 00:21:18,111
Meaning?

260
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:23,908
I will give you something
that is more valuable than Collette Stenger.

261
00:21:24,998 --> 00:21:27,308
It's hard to know what that might be.

262
00:21:27,399 --> 00:21:33,034
Our roster of all known terrorist suspects
working around the world - our WET list.

263
00:21:33,122 --> 00:21:38,246
As allies, we've requested
this WET list many times before.

264
00:21:38,325 --> 00:21:43,403
But the NSA has always said giving us
the list would jeopardise their operations.

265
00:21:43,488 --> 00:21:47,962
It will, but I don't work for the NSA.
I don't work for CTU.

266
00:21:48,051 --> 00:21:52,171
This is personal. Right now,
you're not giving me another choice.

267
00:21:52,254 --> 00:21:54,132
All right.

268
00:21:54,214 --> 00:21:57,414
I'll give you Collette
in exchange for the WET list.

269
00:21:57,496 --> 00:22:00,571
Good. Let's see what we can do.

270
00:22:02,699 --> 00:22:04,657
Agent Bauer.

271
00:22:04,741 --> 00:22:07,974
I'm aware of several names
that should be on that list.

272
00:22:08,062 --> 00:22:11,182
Don't try and pass me a fake.

273
00:22:11,264 --> 00:22:13,381
O'Brian.

274
00:22:13,466 --> 00:22:17,620
Chloe, it's Jack. Do we still have
a back door to NSA's secured mainframe?

275
00:22:17,708 --> 00:22:20,349
<i>- I can't really talk now.
- OK, fine, then listen.</i>

276
00:22:20,429 --> 00:22:24,823
I need you to log on to their server, download
the WET list and send it to my PDA.

277
00:22:24,913 --> 00:22:25,982
Why?

278
00:22:26,073 --> 00:22:29,226
The WET list is what we have to pay
to get Collette Stenger.

279
00:22:29,315 --> 00:22:31,272
That list is as top-secret as it gets.

280
00:22:31,356 --> 00:22:34,430
Homeland sent a team.
You'll have to clear it with them.

281
00:22:34,518 --> 00:22:36,510
We can't afford for them to say no.

282
00:22:36,599 --> 00:22:39,593
I'm not saying I won't do it, I'm saying I can't.

283
00:22:39,681 --> 00:22:43,073
They took my key card.
I can't get into the NSA mainframe.

284
00:22:43,163 --> 00:22:45,632
Do what you have to.
It's our only way to Bierko.

285
00:22:45,724 --> 00:22:48,193
Fine. I'll call you back.

286
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:56,170
- Here you are.
- OK.

287
00:23:08,577 --> 00:23:13,256
- Excuse me, Miles.
- My God! What is the matter with you?

288
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:15,059
Sorry.

289
00:23:16,142 --> 00:23:18,897
What's wrong with you?

290
00:23:18,984 --> 00:23:21,818
I'll pay for the dry-cleaning.

291
00:23:42,757 --> 00:23:45,273
<i>- Yeah?
- Jack, I got on the NSA server.</i>

292
00:23:45,358 --> 00:23:48,956
- Did you get the file?
- Not yet. They put extra authentication in.

293
00:23:49,041 --> 00:23:51,762
- Can you get around it?
- Hold on.

294
00:23:55,244 --> 00:23:58,875
OK, I got it. I hope you know
what you're doing. I'm uploading it now.

295
00:23:58,966 --> 00:24:00,605
Thanks.

296
00:24:09,932 --> 00:24:12,243
I got it.

297
00:24:42,792 --> 00:24:44,909
Well, it appears legitimate.

298
00:24:44,993 --> 00:24:49,353
It is. Give me back the memory card.

299
00:24:49,436 --> 00:24:55,879
You can't upload the WET list to your people
until I have Collette Stenger in custody.

300
00:24:55,959 --> 00:24:57,951
Fair enough.

301
00:25:00,402 --> 00:25:04,238
We have to go now. We're supposed
to meet at Van Nuys airport in 20 minutes.

302
00:25:04,324 --> 00:25:08,366
- What kind of a car is she driving?
- I don't know. I have to wait in car lot C.

303
00:25:08,447 --> 00:25:12,647
She'll recon the area before
she makes contact. She's cautious by habit.

304
00:25:12,729 --> 00:25:15,962
Curtis, Van Nuys airport.
We'll give you details on the way.

305
00:25:16,051 --> 00:25:18,646
<i>Copy that. All teams, move out.</i>

306
00:25:19,533 --> 00:25:22,732
When you receive the funds,
transfer them to the Caymans account.

307
00:25:22,815 --> 00:25:25,047
<i>- In what currency?
- In euros.</i>

308
00:25:25,136 --> 00:25:28,654
<i>One moment
to enter the authorisation... Logged in.</i>

309
00:25:28,738 --> 00:25:32,369
My bank is ready to accept the transfer.

310
00:25:41,065 --> 00:25:43,297
The file is encrypted.

311
00:25:43,386 --> 00:25:45,778
What is the decryption key?

312
00:25:45,868 --> 00:25:47,780
Transfer the funds.

313
00:25:54,913 --> 00:25:58,625
<i>- It's been sent.
- Your transaction is completed.</i>

314
00:25:58,716 --> 00:26:02,154
Thank you.
Email me confirmation of the transfer.

315
00:26:14,885 --> 00:26:18,596
The decryption key
is Charlie, Alpha, three, nine, Alpha.

316
00:26:22,649 --> 00:26:24,960
It worked. This is what you wanted.

317
00:26:25,051 --> 00:26:27,202
Of course it is.

318
00:26:29,373 --> 00:26:32,048
Until next time, gentlemen.

319
00:26:38,939 --> 00:26:40,851
- Are the men ready?
- Yes.

320
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:43,934
Torch this place. We're moving out.

321
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:03,512
I'm not trying to coopt your authority,
but we are in the middle of a crisis here.

322
00:27:03,594 --> 00:27:06,429
Either transmit my orders
to the National Guard,

323
00:27:06,515 --> 00:27:10,511
or I can federalise them and give them
my orders directly. Your choice.

324
00:27:10,598 --> 00:27:14,229
<i>- We'll do it your way.
- Excellent. Thank you, Governor.</i>

325
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:16,232
I look forward to your cooperation.

326
00:27:16,321 --> 00:27:18,278
We have a situation at a roadblock.

327
00:27:18,362 --> 00:27:20,673
- The commander needs your call.
- Tell me.

328
00:27:20,763 --> 00:27:23,484
Wayne Palmer is insisting he be let through.

329
00:27:23,565 --> 00:27:27,355
- He claims he's on official business.
- And where exactly is that?

330
00:27:27,447 --> 00:27:31,203
- He was on the access road to the retreat.
- He's on his way here? To do what?

331
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:36,208
He wouldn't give the officer in charge
of the roadblock any information at first.

332
00:27:37,453 --> 00:27:40,447
What should I tell the roadblock, sir?

333
00:27:43,696 --> 00:27:46,974
All I'm asking you to do
is call and confirm I have clearance.

334
00:27:47,059 --> 00:27:52,819
Regardless of clearance, authorisation must
come down through the chain of command.

335
00:27:52,902 --> 00:27:57,614
And just who would that be, huh, Captain?
Who's in charge of the military's role in this?

336
00:28:02,067 --> 00:28:05,220
<i>- Riggs.
- Mr. Palmer's clearance is approved.</i>

337
00:28:05,309 --> 00:28:07,950
<i>- Understood.
- He's allowed into the retreat.</i>

338
00:28:08,031 --> 00:28:11,469
Thank you, sir.
You can go on through now, sir.

339
00:28:11,552 --> 00:28:13,863
Let him through.

340
00:28:13,954 --> 00:28:16,345
Thank you, Captain.

341
00:28:26,801 --> 00:28:28,714
<i>All teams are in position.</i>

342
00:28:28,803 --> 00:28:32,718
- No one moves in until I confirm that it's her.
- Copy that.

343
00:28:32,805 --> 00:28:37,483
Collette won't show herself if she senses
anything's wrong. Make sure he stays hidden.

344
00:28:37,568 --> 00:28:39,799
Don't worry. He will.

345
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:44,885
What'll happen to her, to Collette?

346
00:28:44,972 --> 00:28:48,649
- I don't know yet. Why?
- Just curious.

347
00:28:49,135 --> 00:28:51,696
Have you been in my situation?

348
00:28:51,776 --> 00:28:55,214
I've been undercover
for long stretches of time, yeah.

349
00:28:55,298 --> 00:28:58,849
Ever been involved with a woman
during that time?

350
00:29:01,101 --> 00:29:04,015
We're doing
what has to be done for our countries,

351
00:29:04,102 --> 00:29:07,541
but sometimes it's harder than others.

352
00:29:09,226 --> 00:29:13,222
- Could you join us in the situation room?
- Sure.

353
00:29:26,516 --> 00:29:30,193
- What's going on?
- Why don't you tell us, Ms O'Brian?

354
00:29:30,278 --> 00:29:32,588
I don't know.

355
00:29:32,679 --> 00:29:35,718
We've got you hacking into
a top-secret NSA archive.

356
00:29:36,162 --> 00:29:39,633
- I don't know what you mean.
- I pulled an archive of your traffic.

357
00:29:39,724 --> 00:29:44,242
Whatever you took from NSA
was uploaded to Jack Bauer's remote node.

358
00:29:44,326 --> 00:29:50,325
Ms O'Brian, tell us exactly
what document you passed to Jack Bauer.

359
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:54,883
Chloe, this is gonna get much worse
if you force me to have NSA run a back trace.

360
00:29:55,332 --> 00:29:57,484
What is it?

361
00:29:58,575 --> 00:30:01,409
- Jack needed the WET list.
- What?

362
00:30:01,496 --> 00:30:03,568
Why on earth would you give him that?

363
00:30:03,658 --> 00:30:06,651
Stoller wouldn't lead us
to Collette Stenger without it.

364
00:30:06,739 --> 00:30:10,621
Giving that list to another
intelligence agency could be disastrous.

365
00:30:10,701 --> 00:30:13,456
Years of work could be rendered useless.

366
00:30:13,543 --> 00:30:15,899
- Jack needed it, OK?
- No! No, It's not OK!

367
00:30:15,985 --> 00:30:20,185
And you expected us
to give your agents a chance?

368
00:30:21,588 --> 00:30:23,784
Get me Bauer.

369
00:30:30,032 --> 00:30:33,265
Put it on speakerphone
or I'm getting out of this car.

370
00:30:33,354 --> 00:30:35,232
Fine.

371
00:30:38,077 --> 00:30:42,437
<i>- It's Bauer.
- Jack, it's Bill. Karen Hayes is here as well.</i>

372
00:30:42,519 --> 00:30:45,832
If you're with Stoller,
get someplace you can talk privately.

373
00:30:45,922 --> 00:30:49,359
I can't. If I move, I'll jeopardise our position.

374
00:30:49,444 --> 00:30:53,075
You'll have to speak in front of him.
Have you given him the WET list?

375
00:30:53,166 --> 00:30:55,840
- Yes.
- Has he given it to German intelligence?

376
00:30:55,928 --> 00:30:58,204
- No.
- Then get it back now!

377
00:30:58,288 --> 00:31:04,289
I can't. Stoller won't cooperate and we'll lose
Collette Stenger. Bill, explain this to her.

378
00:31:04,372 --> 00:31:09,244
It's not his decision. Retrieve the WET list
now or I will order Agent Manning to do it.

379
00:31:09,335 --> 00:31:12,134
Collette Stenger
is our only connection to Bierko.

380
00:31:12,217 --> 00:31:16,417
If you blow this, you will be responsible
for every life lost in his next attack.

381
00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:20,700
- I don't like to be threatened, Mr. Bauer.
- That's not a threat, that's a fact.

382
00:31:21,142 --> 00:31:25,137
German intelligence will move
on people we have been watching for years.

383
00:31:25,224 --> 00:31:28,583
Our ability to prevent terrorist attacks
will be threatened.

384
00:31:28,666 --> 00:31:32,104
It's a risk we'll have to take.
We have to deal with this situation.

385
00:31:32,188 --> 00:31:34,021
It's not your call or mine.

386
00:31:34,109 --> 00:31:37,786
- We need authorisation from the president.
- Then get it!

387
00:31:37,872 --> 00:31:40,865
Our team ID'd a woman
fitting Stenger's description

388
00:31:40,954 --> 00:31:44,585
driving a red Lexus making a circuit
around the lot. It could be her.

389
00:31:44,675 --> 00:31:47,145
We have a possible suspect approaching.

390
00:31:47,237 --> 00:31:52,678
Ms Hayes, are you telling me that
I have to abort this operation? Yes or no?

391
00:31:52,761 --> 00:31:54,717
Ms Hayes, this is your call.

392
00:31:54,802 --> 00:31:57,840
You don't know for certain
that she will lead us to Bierko.

393
00:31:57,923 --> 00:32:00,962
No, not for certain.
But right now, she's our only lead.

394
00:32:01,045 --> 00:32:03,082
Are you willing to take this chance?

395
00:32:03,166 --> 00:32:08,402
You've left me no choice. Proceed. But you
have severely compromised this situation

396
00:32:08,489 --> 00:32:11,689
and I promise you
there will be repercussions.

397
00:32:11,771 --> 00:32:13,684
Fine.

398
00:32:15,173 --> 00:32:17,404
Are we all right?

399
00:32:17,494 --> 00:32:19,327
We're fine.

400
00:32:23,377 --> 00:32:26,018
Red Lexus turning the corner.
100 yards away.

401
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:28,694
No one move until I give a go.

402
00:32:37,386 --> 00:32:39,537
The red Lexus has parked.

403
00:32:39,627 --> 00:32:43,065
Move the centre mirror
so that I can see the car.

404
00:32:46,191 --> 00:32:48,263
There.

405
00:32:50,433 --> 00:32:52,425
Now get her out of the car.

406
00:33:07,523 --> 00:33:10,277
- Hi.
- Hello.

407
00:33:12,806 --> 00:33:14,798
I have a positive ID. Move in.

408
00:33:14,887 --> 00:33:16,561
All teams, move! Let's go!

409
00:33:17,609 --> 00:33:21,206
- Put your hands where I can see them!
- Get in the car now. Let go of me.

410
00:33:21,291 --> 00:33:23,248
- Let me see your hands!
- Let go now!

411
00:33:23,333 --> 00:33:26,007
- Theo, get out of there.
- I'm sorry.

412
00:33:26,094 --> 00:33:27,653
Theo, who are you?

413
00:33:27,735 --> 00:33:30,728
Move! Let him go.
He's given us what we want.

414
00:33:30,817 --> 00:33:33,617
Put your hands up!

415
00:33:33,698 --> 00:33:36,498
Turn and face the car.

416
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:39,779
Put your hands on the roof.

417
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:44,499
Do it!

418
00:34:02,275 --> 00:34:04,551
Where is Bierko?

419
00:34:05,317 --> 00:34:09,106
We know you're working with Bierko.
Where is he?

420
00:34:09,879 --> 00:34:12,474
Fine.

421
00:34:15,042 --> 00:34:18,639
Take her back to staging.
I want a team searching this car.

422
00:34:18,724 --> 00:34:22,401
Everything goes back
to the staging area. Now!

423
00:34:31,211 --> 00:34:34,922
<i>- Yeah.
- It's Theo. I'm going to the hotel.</i>

424
00:34:35,013 --> 00:34:39,885
Tell Heinrich I'm uploading something
he's been wanting for a long time.

425
00:35:08,553 --> 00:35:10,466
- Stoller.
- Theo, it's Jack.

426
00:35:10,554 --> 00:35:12,591
- I'm sorry.
- We had a deal.

427
00:35:12,676 --> 00:35:16,910
When this is over, I will help you rebuild
your investigation. I give you my word.

428
00:35:16,998 --> 00:35:20,470
I had your word. Now I know what it's worth.

429
00:35:40,644 --> 00:35:45,197
- What have you got?
- There's no sign of what she sold to Bierko.

430
00:35:45,286 --> 00:35:47,722
Come with me.

431
00:35:49,929 --> 00:35:52,968
Collette Stenger, my name is Jack Bauer.

432
00:35:53,051 --> 00:35:56,602
- Who is Theo? Really?
- German intelligence.

433
00:35:57,133 --> 00:36:01,414
He sold me for a price. German and US
intelligence don't work together often.

434
00:36:01,496 --> 00:36:04,376
Where is Bierko?

435
00:36:04,457 --> 00:36:08,055
The fact is, I actually had feelings for Theo.

436
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:11,657
I never once suspected. He was very good.

437
00:36:11,741 --> 00:36:16,739
I always thought that
there were some things that you cannot fake.

438
00:36:17,825 --> 00:36:19,942
Bierko.

439
00:36:23,028 --> 00:36:25,020
- Tell them to leave.
- Jack?

440
00:36:25,109 --> 00:36:27,625
It's all right.

441
00:36:27,711 --> 00:36:31,069
Curtis, have your men move back.
Just give us a second.

442
00:36:31,153 --> 00:36:33,349
You heard him.

443
00:36:38,677 --> 00:36:40,555
Theo had a price. What's yours?

444
00:36:40,639 --> 00:36:42,915
- I'm not for sale.
- Everyone is for sale.

445
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,314
This isn't a game, lady. We're
running out of time. Tell me what you want.

446
00:36:47,403 --> 00:36:49,121
All right.

447
00:36:49,564 --> 00:36:51,760
Full immunity, no holdbacks,

448
00:36:51,845 --> 00:36:56,125
signed by your president and transmitted
to lawyers in Zurich and Tripoli.

449
00:36:56,207 --> 00:36:58,518
- But I can't tell you where Bierko is.
- Why not?

450
00:36:58,609 --> 00:37:00,760
He's gone. I met him at a safe house.

451
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:04,083
- He was going to carry out the attack.
- What did you sell him?

452
00:37:04,172 --> 00:37:05,811
- I don't know.
- What do you mean?

453
00:37:05,893 --> 00:37:09,730
- I don't know. It was a schematic.
- What kind of a schematic?

454
00:37:09,815 --> 00:37:14,096
I'm paid to broker the information,
not dwell on the details. It's my firm policy.

455
00:37:14,177 --> 00:37:18,378
You want me to believe you acquired
information and didn't know the specifics?

456
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:20,338
You can believe whatever you want.

457
00:37:20,421 --> 00:37:24,417
I got the schematics from a source
and they were digitally encrypted.

458
00:37:24,503 --> 00:37:29,136
That source can tell you what they mean. Give
me immunity and I'll give you my source.

459
00:37:29,227 --> 00:37:31,617
Those are my terms.

460
00:37:33,429 --> 00:37:36,069
You haven't offered us very much.

461
00:37:36,631 --> 00:37:39,192
I'll see what I can do.

462
00:37:45,916 --> 00:37:47,589
Buchanan.

463
00:37:47,677 --> 00:37:52,708
It's Jack. She wants full immunity.
She claims she doesn't know where Bierko is,

464
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,033
that she brokered a deal for schematics
and delivered them.

465
00:37:56,122 --> 00:38:00,197
She doesn't know what building they're for,
but she can provide the source.

466
00:38:00,285 --> 00:38:03,757
- She doesn't know what she sold him?
- She said it was encrypted.

467
00:38:03,847 --> 00:38:06,760
- Do you believe her?
- She's an independent contractor.

468
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:10,206
In her work, sometimes
what you don't know will save your life.

469
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:15,128
If she's telling the truth, we don't have much
time. She said Bierko left for his next attack.

470
00:38:15,213 --> 00:38:17,365
Call Mike Novick. Get this started.

471
00:38:17,454 --> 00:38:20,927
Jack, this better work.
And for the record, I don't like it.

472
00:38:21,016 --> 00:38:24,408
We've paid a steep price.
There'll be fallout on the WET list.

473
00:38:24,498 --> 00:38:27,059
The fallout will be from German intelligence.

474
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:30,214
I programmed the memory card
to self-destruct.

475
00:38:30,302 --> 00:38:34,058
- Why didn't you tell us this before?
- I was in the car with Stoller.

476
00:38:34,144 --> 00:38:37,103
Get back to me as soon as this is done.
We need to move fast.

477
00:38:40,667 --> 00:38:45,107
I think it's clear - CTU was hit,
but we're still doing our job.

478
00:38:45,671 --> 00:38:48,550
I believe that's an argument
to maintain our autonomy.

479
00:38:48,632 --> 00:38:52,674
I'll withhold judgment. We're giving
a free pass to a terrorist collaborator.

480
00:38:52,754 --> 00:38:54,872
I've yet to see what we're getting from it.

481
00:40:38,255 --> 00:40:41,408
<i>- Has the document been received in Tripoli?
- Yes.</i>

482
00:40:41,497 --> 00:40:44,138
- It meets with your approval?
- It does.

483
00:40:44,219 --> 00:40:46,893
There's no way
they can fail to live up to the terms?

484
00:40:46,981 --> 00:40:51,420
<i>- Not if you give them what they want.
- Merci, Hervé. Au revoir.</i>

485
00:40:53,224 --> 00:40:58,665
The safe house is a manufacturing facility
at 12451 Saticoy Boulevard.

486
00:40:58,747 --> 00:41:03,301
As for the data I sold to Bierko, I received it
from a contact at the Department of Defense.

487
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:06,269
- What's his name?
- Her name.

488
00:41:06,712 --> 00:41:08,431
Audrey Raines.

489
00:41:09,433 --> 00:41:11,425
You are lying to me.

490
00:41:13,035 --> 00:41:18,032
She sold me the information, Mr. Bauer.
Apparently, she had a price.

491
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,037
Put her in the car.
