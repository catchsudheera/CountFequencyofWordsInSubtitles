1
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,472
- What happened, Sherry?
- I went to the house to speak to Julia.

2
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:23,150
Alan interrupted us. There was an argument,
and he had a heart attack.

3
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,595
You stood there and you watched a man die.

4
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:29,190
Complex problems sometimes have
the simplest solutions.

5
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:33,313
- We can't cover this thing up.
- We can and we will.

6
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,116
- The deal was we get paid in full.
- The deal changed when you went to Mexico.

7
00:00:38,151 --> 00:00:42,396
After you've hit the hotel,
you get the rest of your money.

8
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:47,235
- Where's the virus, you son of a bitch?
- You're too late, Jack.

9
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,470
- We've got Amador.
- What about the virus?

10
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,280
- We've got a high-probability target.
- What is it?

11
00:00:52,315 --> 00:00:54,190
The Chandler Plaza Hotel on Wilshire.

12
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,717
- How can I help?
- There's a threat against your hotel.

13
00:00:57,752 --> 00:01:00,512
Do not allow anybody
in or out of the structure.

14
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:05,150
<i>- What's the nature of the threat?
- The release of an infectious substance.</i>

15
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:09,359
If this virus gets out, you die,
just like everyone else.

16
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,877
Gael, the virus
is in the central ventilation unit.

17
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:36,840
This is Agent Ortega. A toxic substance
has been released into the forced air unit.

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:38,885
My God.

19
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:42,117
We need to shut down the unit.
Where's the control panel?

20
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:48,231
On your left there's a row of fuses running
down the right side, one for each floor.

21
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,680
This toxic release, how bad is it?

22
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,754
Agent Ortega?

23
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,754
Just taking precautions, Mr Phillips.

24
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:07,078
How much of the virus was released?

25
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:10,430
Enough to kill everyone in the building.

26
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,676
Did you plant vials anywhere else?

27
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,714
Don't you get it? We're all going to die.

28
00:02:15,749 --> 00:02:18,489
Did you plant any other vials?

29
00:02:18,524 --> 00:02:21,230
My assignment was the hotel.

30
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,080
So there are others?

31
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,285
Yes.

32
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,085
How many?

33
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,430
11, but I don't know where they are.

34
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,115
Keep an eye on him.

35
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,285
- Dessler.
- What's the status?

36
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,312
Alvers planted a vial
in the ventilation system.

37
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,833
It was on a timing device and it went off
as Gael was trying to disarm it.

38
00:02:50,868 --> 00:02:52,909
- He was in direct contact?
- Yeah.

39
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:57,672
He's shutting down the system, but we have
to assume it's permeated the building.

40
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:01,429
Within 14 hours, anybody exposed
to the virus will become symptomatic.

41
00:03:01,464 --> 00:03:04,920
They'll infect
whoever they come in contact with.

42
00:03:04,955 --> 00:03:07,434
Yeah, I know.

43
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,751
No one can leave.
We have to impose a total quarantine.

44
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,874
- We'll scramble a code-six perimeter.
- We have to be careful.

45
00:03:15,909 --> 00:03:18,685
If people realize what's going on,
there'll be panic.

46
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,837
Our people will hold a 100-yard radius,
stay out of sight.

47
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:26,317
LAPD and Health Services will
move in adjacent to the hotel.

48
00:03:26,352 --> 00:03:30,314
Good. The vial that Alvers planted,
he said there are 11 more.

49
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,232
- Alvers told you this?
- I just left him.

50
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,756
You just left him? Michelle,
he could have been exposed to the virus.

51
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,354
How'd he get outside the hotel?

52
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,876
Michelle?

53
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,638
He didn't leave the hotel.

54
00:03:46,673 --> 00:03:49,357
He's still in the basement.

55
00:03:49,392 --> 00:03:52,320
Are you inside?

56
00:03:52,355 --> 00:03:54,038
Yeah.

57
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,350
What the hell are you doing in there?

58
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,956
I wasn't trying to be a hero.
It was the only decision I could make.

59
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:04,875
- How far are you from the ventilation room?
- I'm not sure.

60
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:08,833
Health Services is bringing protective gear.
Put it on as soon as they get there.

61
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,885
<i>If we can get you out, we can isolate you...</i>

62
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:14,799
- Tony, I can't leave.
- I'm ordering you to get out!

63
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,079
That's an order I can't obey. There are
only seven other agents, including Gael,

64
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,999
and a hotel full of people
that need to be contained.

65
00:04:22,034 --> 00:04:24,678
Communications, testing,
it all has to be coordinated.

66
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,885
- I'm the ranking officer.
- Michelle, look...

67
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:33,311
If I've been exposed,
there's nothing anyone can do.

68
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,485
Alvers said there were 11 more vials.

69
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:42,433
He said he doesn't know where they are.
I believe him.

70
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,676
<i>Tony?</i>

71
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,948
Yeah.

72
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,071
<i>I have to go. Call me
when you have a working protocol.</i>

73
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,275
- Can I have a moment?
- Yes, sir.

74
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,153
You and I both know
I don't have a lot of time here.

75
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:33,348
I need to know who's behind this.
You said he knows me. Just give me a name.

76
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,791
Do what you want to me.
I'm telling you nothing.

77
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:43,599
We found the incubator with the virus in it
in the room next door.

78
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:49,472
If you don't tell me what I need to know,
I'll put you in there and I'll open it up.

79
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:53,879
<i>Then I'll die. But I won't talk.</i>

80
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,085
<i>- Bauer.
- Jack, this is Chappelle.</i>

81
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,908
<i>The virus has been released into the
ventilation system of the Chandler Plaza.</i>

82
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:05,680
Alvers says there are 11 other vials
but won't or can't tell us where they are.

83
00:06:05,715 --> 00:06:10,040
- Amador's our only other link, Jack.
- He says whoever's behind this knows me.

84
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,675
Is it someone you worked with or against?

85
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,712
- That's what we're trying to figure out.
- Bring Amador back.

86
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,713
We don't have time. We don't know when
the 11 other vials are gonna be released.

87
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:23,708
- We'll put him in a room with Richards.
- You put Nina in a room with Richards.

88
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,908
You got no information and three
dead agents. Let me handle this.

89
00:06:27,943 --> 00:06:30,917
- You're gonna have to trust me.
- All right.

90
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:35,833
Jack, we got some readings off the incubator.

91
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:40,079
That was Ryan. The virus has been released
at the Chandler Plaza Hotel.

92
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:44,518
There are 11 other vials. We don't know where
they are or when they're gonna be released.

93
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,431
He probably does.

94
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:51,311
He says he'd rather be dead than talk, and
I believe him. It's not gonna matter, though.

95
00:06:51,346 --> 00:06:55,113
As soon as we have his boss in custody,
we'll turn him over as a witness.

96
00:06:55,320 --> 00:07:00,348
- Always thinking, aren't you, Jack?
- Shut up. Take the wall.

97
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,153
Knees.

98
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,634
We'll be right back.

99
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,433
Powder was ground into particles
small enough to suspend it in the air.

100
00:07:41,468 --> 00:07:43,076
Most windows at the hotel don't open,

101
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,910
so the contaminated air
would just circulate within the hotel.

102
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:50,157
We could contain it.

103
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,037
<i>- Tony, it's Nicole Duncan.
- You on your way to the hotel?</i>

104
00:07:55,072 --> 00:07:57,035
Yeah, we'll be there as fast as we can.

105
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,312
- What's the status?
- We're setting up a covert perimeter.

106
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,195
We're bringing a mobile lab
to test people inside.

107
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:07,199
That can only be accomplished
if the situation is stable.

108
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,805
Michelle's got that covered.

109
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,593
She's inside the hotel? Unprotected?

110
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,912
Yeah. Look, I'll get back to you.

111
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:21,352
Here's the protocol. No one's allowed to leave
or communicate with the outside.

112
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,205
Health Services will establish a perimeter.

113
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,298
LAPD'll move in as soon as
the area's deemed safe.

114
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:30,357
Have they been given
degree-of-force parameters?

115
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,910
No, that's your call.

116
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:39,270
One person gets out, it could start a ripple
effect of transmission throughout the city.

117
00:08:39,305 --> 00:08:45,236
Orders are to shoot to kill anyone
who attempts to leave. No exceptions.

118
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,205
Michelle, all the exits have been secured.

119
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,879
Good. Shut down the elevators
and the phone system.

120
00:08:53,914 --> 00:08:56,837
- It's that serious?
- Potentially, yes.

121
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,232
No one can leave.
Our first priority is to prevent a panic.

122
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,199
Shutting down operations will create one.
People still have their cellphones.

123
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:08,991
- We're aiming a jamming signal at the hotel.
- How do you stay in contact with CTU?

124
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:12,805
Our phones operate on pinhole frequency.
We won't be affected.

125
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:16,355
- Is anyone gonna survive this?
- That's what we're here to ensure.

126
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,405
We're gonna rely on your leadership.

127
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,194
You and your employees
will be our first line of defence, OK?

128
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,190
We also need to shut down the fire alarm.

129
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:31,629
It's hard-wired to the main grid.
It has to be shut down one node at a time.

130
00:09:31,664 --> 00:09:34,034
- I'll take care of it.
- Thank you.

131
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,805
We've probably got an hour before people
start waking up. Where's Alvers?

132
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:44,038
He's downstairs with Peterson. He gave up
nothing except that there are more vials.

133
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:59,789
Gael, I know you wouldn't have been
exposed to the virus if it wasn't for me.

134
00:09:59,824 --> 00:10:03,599
You didn't have us do anything
we wouldn't have done on our own.

135
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,438
Margolis. I'm gonna need you
to stay for a while.

136
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,189
I can't put in OT. My wife's a week overdue.

137
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,035
The ventilation system may have
released an irritant into the air.

138
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:33,205
- I need personnel to deal with the guests.
- I'm not a doctor. What can I do?

139
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:39,873
The Health Department are on their way.
I will get you outta here as soon as I can.

140
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,034
- This is Bauer.
- Dad, Amador's left the building.

141
00:11:17,069 --> 00:11:19,429
<i>- Which way is he headed?
- I'm triangulating him.</i>

142
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,718
- We're on. Hurry, Kim.
- He's heading south on Western at 16th.

143
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,595
OK. We're on our way.

144
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,877
- How many people in the hotel?
- About a thousand.

145
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:52,594
All right. Call the governor. If this thing
spreads and there's a citywide panic,

146
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:55,391
he has to be ready to mobilize
state troopers and the National Guard.

147
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,831
Yes, Mr President.

148
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,789
But I want him to hold off the order
until he hears from us.

149
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,796
OK.

150
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,395
- Sorry.
- Hi.

151
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,596
You look tired.

152
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:19,873
David, I'm bringing you a problem,
but I'm also bringing you a solution.

153
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,405
- Let's hear the problem.
- Julia Milliken.

154
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,896
She was interviewed by the police
about Alan's death

155
00:12:26,931 --> 00:12:30,353
and she's claiming
I had something to do with it.

156
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,949
Did you?

157
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,112
Does that really matter?

158
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,995
Only you could say that, Sherry.

159
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,349
You always claim to want the truth,

160
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:46,240
but your whole life you've been surrounded
by people who've protected you from it.

161
00:12:46,275 --> 00:12:50,711
- I never asked to be protected.
- But the fact remains you have been.

162
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,098
Tonight I'm gonna take you at your word.

163
00:12:54,133 --> 00:12:57,157
I'm actually gonna tell you the truth.

164
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,392
Thank you.

165
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:05,552
I was with Julia Milliken
when Alan had his heart attack.

166
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:09,476
She was going to give him his medicine
and I stopped her.

167
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,598
We both watched him die.

168
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:18,340
- That's murder.
- And Julia told the police everything.

169
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:22,366
They just called me a little while ago
and I told them...

170
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:26,358
I told them that I was with you
at the time of Alan's death.

171
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,749
So I expect they'll be contacting you
to verify my story.

172
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:36,439
- And you expect me to do that?
- It would be a serious mistake not to.

173
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:40,918
Because if you don't, I will tell them
that I was acting on your behalf.

174
00:13:40,953 --> 00:13:43,149
No one's gonna believe
I asked you to kill him.

175
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:47,438
No. But maybe they'll believe
that you were having a problem with him,

176
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,005
that you told me to take
all necessary measures to solve it.

177
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:55,272
That's a nice sound bite for the media.
"Take all necessary measures."

178
00:13:55,307 --> 00:14:01,190
- I never used those words.
- Well... think it over, David.

179
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,445
Tony, I've got you on speaker.

180
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,995
We're on Hoover, running parallel
to Amador's position on Vermont.

181
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,548
We've got you.
Where'd you put the transponder?

182
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:12,231
- In a bandage on his hand.
- This could all backfire, Jack.

183
00:15:12,266 --> 00:15:14,435
We had to let him believe that he'd escaped.

184
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,155
I'm just saying that
he may just be heading out of town.

185
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,989
Whoever Amador's working for
has connections.

186
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,845
He'll need his help to get out of here.

187
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,953
- You want some backup?
- No. If we get any closer, he'll make us.

188
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:32,757
Did Michelle compile the list of all the
contacts I've had over the last five years?

189
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,845
I had to put Chloe on it.

190
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,111
Michelle's inside the Chandler Plaza Hotel.

191
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:45,755
I'm sorry, Tony.
Look, we think the virus has been altered.

192
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:48,114
- Altered how?
- Combined with another chemical.

193
00:15:48,149 --> 00:15:50,913
It's on its way to NHS to get tested now.

194
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:55,756
- You're saying she might have a chance?
- Maybe. I hope so.

195
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:59,953
Tony, we'll get back to you
as soon as we've got anything, OK?

196
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,910
<i>- Yes?
- It's Amador.</i>

197
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,955
<i>I was detained by some CTU agents.</i>

198
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:15,038
<i>They put me through hell
trying to force me to give you up.</i>

199
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:18,390
- Did you?
- Course not. I need a way out of the country.

200
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:21,513
Of course.

201
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,070
Was Jack Bauer one of the agents?

202
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,236
Yes.

203
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:34,076
I need you to be certain
you're not being followed before we meet.

204
00:16:34,111 --> 00:16:36,240
- You know what to do.
- Understood.

205
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:39,797
Good. Call me when you're sure.

206
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,638
- You have the location?
- When do you want it released?

207
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:03,835
This will ring twice. Once you've set
the timer, make sure it's destroyed.

208
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:22,638
- How long before you can move in?
- About half an hour.

209
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:26,628
We found out that the virus was altered,
combined with another compound.

210
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:31,272
Until that compound's analyzed,
we have no idea what we're dealing with.

211
00:17:31,307 --> 00:17:34,630
So what's the mortality rate
among those exposed to the virus?

212
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:37,400
In its unaltered form, approximately 90%.

213
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:44,509
Look, if somebody was exposed
for just a short time...

214
00:17:44,544 --> 00:17:46,795
would leaving the hotel make a difference?

215
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:50,797
- I'm not making sense.
- Once you're exposed, you're exposed.

216
00:17:50,832 --> 00:17:54,755
The length of exposure
has no real bearing on survivability.

217
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,205
You said 10% would survive.

218
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:04,429
If the virus was altered, is there a chance
the percentage would go up?

219
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:09,789
It's possible, Tony.
We'll do everything we can for her.

220
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,796
Yeah, thanks.

221
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,235
<i>- The whole floor?
- 30 parts per million.</i>

222
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:28,991
- Have you checked the service areas?
- I have the corridor. Stairwell?

223
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,958
<i>- Which floors?
- All levels.</i>

224
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,576
<i>- 35 parts per million.
- Elevator shaft?</i>

225
00:18:33,611 --> 00:18:36,113
<i>I'm getting inconsistent readings on that.</i>

226
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,908
- Recheck it and get back to me.
- Copy that.

227
00:18:38,943 --> 00:18:40,796
OK. Out.

228
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:45,750
Floors one through five
show 30 parts per million or greater.

229
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:51,876
Yeah, same as the rest of the hotel.
Even the lobby's contaminated.

230
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,405
OK.

231
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:57,318
I'll call CTU. You call NHS.

232
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,996
All right.

233
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,605
<i>CTU. Hello?</i>

234
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,995
I'll call you back.

235
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,031
Gael.

236
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,198
- Gael!
- Michelle, stay back!

237
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:45,033
One of my agents just started showing
symptoms. What the hell's going on?

238
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:48,596
- Does it really matter?
- Incubation is supposed to be 14 hours.

239
00:19:48,631 --> 00:19:51,676
You're the chemist. What did you do?

240
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,311
Tell me!

241
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,918
Under one condition.

242
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,885
You're in no position to make demands.

243
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:10,155
I'm the only one who knows what I did.
That dies with me unless you do what I want.

244
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,790
- What do you want?
- I know what the virus does.

245
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,885
I don't wanna die like that.

246
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:25,871
I'll tell you what you wanna know if you
swear you'll kill me once the symptoms start.

247
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,836
Come.

248
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,869
What's the latest on the hotel?

249
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,316
It's unclear how much of that virus
was released or how many were exposed.

250
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,080
You might wanna make an announcement
as to how to deal with the outbreak.

251
00:20:52,115 --> 00:20:56,471
No, I'm not making any announcements
until more facts are known.

252
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,190
Listen, David, I just heard from LAPD.

253
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,994
They consider Sherry to be a flight risk.

254
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:09,430
They have a warrant for her arrest if you
don't back her alibi that she was with you.

255
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:13,473
- You mean lie?
- There is nothing to think about here.

256
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:16,069
Perjury and obstruction of justice
are nothing?

257
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,675
You have the most powerful legal apparatus
in the world at your disposal.

258
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:23,434
You let me call the AG's office
and this so-called problem disappears.

259
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,845
No, it just widens the conspiracy,
and it'll never hold.

260
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,316
Are you gonna let everything
you've accomplished be destroyed

261
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,045
because of what,
because of Sherry's indiscretion?

262
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,152
Listen to yourself.
You're calling murder an indiscretion?

263
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,672
- For God's sakes, grow up!
- Who do you think you're talking to?

264
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:46,080
To an ex-president, David, unless
you do the only thing that makes sense here.

265
00:21:46,115 --> 00:21:49,038
Sherry said if she goes down,
she'll take you with her.

266
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:54,518
- Do your job. Make sure that doesn't happen.
- Then stop tying my hands.

267
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:01,645
I wanna see the chief of police.

268
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:04,797
Dammit, David, we can stonewall 'em.
We can survive this.

269
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,955
Get him out of bed
and bring him directly to me.

270
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:34,835
- So where are we?
- Caltrans just redirected all the traffic.

271
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:38,590
Chloe, how long before we have
enough agents around the hotel?

272
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,645
- At least a half-hour.
- Dammit.

273
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:45,629
- Tony, I got Michelle on line three.
- I'll take it over here.

274
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,045
Hey.

275
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:52,550
<i>- It's worse than we thought.
- What are you talking about?</i>

276
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:56,878
Gael started hemorrhaging from the nose
and mouth less than an hour after exposure.

277
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,031
So the incubation period
is no longer 14 hours?

278
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,473
According to Alvers, the compound
he added to the virus acts as an accelerant.

279
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,636
Is Gael the only one showing symptoms?

280
00:23:06,671 --> 00:23:08,596
As far as I know.

281
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:13,078
- Where is he?
- I isolated him in a room in the basement.

282
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,992
Were you exposed to any of his blood?

283
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,868
No, but we tested the air throughout the hotel.

284
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,839
The virus is everywhere
and I've been breathing it.

285
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:30,074
Reinforcements are on their way. We need
a hard perimeter as soon as possible.

286
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,040
I'll get back to you.

287
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:36,711
- Michelle...
- We can't do this now.

288
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:40,629
We have to focus on making sure
no one gets out of here.

289
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,636
Yeah. OK.

290
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:52,868
- You gotta tell me what's going on.
- What are you talking about?

291
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:58,991
There are people outside this hotel with guns
and every door I've tried is locked.

292
00:23:59,026 --> 00:24:00,716
Federal agents dealing with a problem.

293
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,878
What kind of problem?
Are we in trouble? Please.

294
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,038
That is all that they've told me.
I don't know any more.

295
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:12,559
- And you're sticking around?
- We have no choice. They can keep us here.

296
00:24:12,594 --> 00:24:18,038
- So what are we supposed to do?
- We stay calm and hope for the best.

297
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,436
OK?

298
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,636
Yeah.

299
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:08,845
Yeah?

300
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,077
<i>- It's Michelle. How are you feeling?
- I'm OK. I'm all right.</i>

301
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,677
<i>The bleeding stops and starts, but...</i>

302
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,230
<i>I just feel very...</i>

303
00:25:18,265 --> 00:25:19,632
very weak.

304
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:23,036
As soon as NHS gets here,
they're gonna send a doctor in to see you.

305
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:26,113
To track the progress of the virus.

306
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:29,238
And to make you more comfortable.

307
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,845
You gotta get 'em here soon.

308
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:39,350
Gonna have a hard time keeping people
in the hotel once they wake up.

309
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,871
- What's that?
- I'll call you back.

310
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,845
- I thought it was disconnected.
- I thought so too.

311
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:39,793
- Can you shut it off?
- I'm on my way. I have to find the override.

312
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,834
Get on the intercom. Say it was a false alarm
and to stay in their rooms.

313
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:47,431
I need you to go to the stairwell
and turn people back around.

314
00:26:47,466 --> 00:26:51,159
Everyone else, man the doors.
Nobody gets out.

315
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:15,111
I've doubled back on my route a few times.
There's no one on my tail.

316
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:18,278
- You're certain?
- Yeah, the streets are empty.

317
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,080
- Just bring me in.
- How far are you from the location?

318
00:27:22,115 --> 00:27:24,196
I'll be there soon.

319
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,880
Park a few blocks away and walk.
Look for a silver Ford.

320
00:27:26,915 --> 00:27:29,872
<i>Dolan'll be waiting
with your travel documents.</i>

321
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,238
I'll need cash
to help me get out of the country.

322
00:27:33,273 --> 00:27:35,997
<i>- He'll have that for you as well.
- Good.</i>

323
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:44,113
Amador's making a U-turn.
He's heading downtown.

324
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:48,068
We've got him. Bring in the follow teams.
Tell 'em to stay at a safe distance.

325
00:27:48,103 --> 00:27:50,952
Amador won't lead us to
whoever he works for unless he feels safe.

326
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:55,314
- Coordinating the follow teams now.
- Copy.

327
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:07,190
<i>- Madison, what's your status?
- The lower level is all secure.</i>

328
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:11,475
<i>- Hold your position.
- Copy that.</i>

329
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,925
It was a false alarm!

330
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,952
If you all go back to your rooms,
everything will be OK.

331
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:22,872
I deactivated the alarm
but the system has to cycle down.

332
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,325
- How long is it gonna take?
- I don't know.

333
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,325
<i> I just wanna know
what the hell is going on!</i>

334
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:32,433
- Everything is fine. You just need to relax.
- Everything doesn't seem fine.

335
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,949
It was a false alarm. It's no problem.

336
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,316
- Then why is he telling me I can't go outside?
- I need you to go upstairs.

337
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:41,996
Not until someone tells me what is going on.

338
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:46,039
What are those people doing outside?
They're wearing gas masks.

339
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:48,715
You can't keep us in here.
I want an explanation.

340
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:54,312
Please, if I can have your attention,
I will explain the situation.

341
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:59,495
I am a federal agent.
I am here because about half an hour ago

342
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:03,630
a toxic substance was released
outside around this building.

343
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,525
Why didn't you tell us before?

344
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:10,873
We didn't want people to panic, rush outside
and expose themselves to this substance.

345
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:15,125
You are safe as long as you stay
inside this hotel.

346
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:20,154
But until we get a clean-up crew out there,
it is not safe to go outside.

347
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:23,518
- How long are we gonna be here?
- Why don't the phones work?

348
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:26,552
Please, we will work this all out,
I promise you.

349
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:30,869
If you go back to your rooms,
everything will be OK.

350
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,125
Excuse me, please. Agent Dessler?

351
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:35,390
- Someone got a fire door open.
- Where?

352
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,710
Signal came from the west side of the hotel.

353
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,325
All those exits feed the same corridor.

354
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,999
Stay here and help my people.
How do I get there?

355
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,125
Down this corridor, right and downstairs.

356
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:49,153
Let's head back up to your rooms.
You heard the lady. There is no problem.

357
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:52,909
- Like hell there isn't.
- It's gonna be just fine.

358
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:57,317
Please. Please, ma'am. Back to your room.
It's gonna be just fine.

359
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:05,111
- Stop right there!
- I'm getting outta here.

360
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:12,033
- I'm a federal agent. Now, drop the gun.
- No. I just wanna go.

361
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:16,870
- It's not safe to leave. Drop the gun.
- Why isn't it safe?

362
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:20,632
A toxic substance was released
outside around this hotel.

363
00:30:20,667 --> 00:30:22,835
- You're lying.
- No, I am not lying.

364
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:29,229
No, I know about the man in the storeroom.
I know that something bad is in this hotel.

365
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,838
You're right. It is.

366
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,714
- That's why you can't go outside.
- What are you talking about?

367
00:30:38,749 --> 00:30:42,599
Everyone in this hotel
is going to get very sick.

368
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,079
Sick? How sick?

369
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:51,718
Most of us are gonna die.

370
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:57,235
- That's not possible.
- It's the truth.

371
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,718
I just wanna get home to my wife.

372
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:06,553
- My wife...
- If you do, you'll give this to her.

373
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:12,309
Anyone who leaves this hotel
will spread this disease.

374
00:31:12,344 --> 00:31:15,277
Tens of thousands of people could die.

375
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:19,036
You don't wanna be
responsible for that, do you?

376
00:31:19,071 --> 00:31:20,512
Oh, God.

377
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,716
Oh, God.

378
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:33,399
Give me the gun.

379
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:43,750
Now that you know, we have to isolate you.

380
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:47,628
<i>Sit down.</i>

381
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:51,910
Dessler.

382
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:55,796
- We need you back here. There is a problem.
- What's going on?

383
00:31:55,960 --> 00:32:01,193
Someone just started bleeding from
the nose and mouth and we cannot stop it.

384
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,117
Mr President?

385
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,995
Chief Hendricks.

386
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:33,315
- Chief Hendricks.
- Mr President.

387
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,318
- Please, have a seat.
- Thank you, sir.

388
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,795
I realize this is
an irregular hour for a meeting.

389
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:41,308
The circumstances are irregular,
Mr President.

390
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:45,405
Yes, they are. I assume
you've been briefed on the Milliken case?

391
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:50,840
I know Julia Milliken stated that Mrs Palmer
contributed to the death of Alan Milliken

392
00:32:50,875 --> 00:32:53,798
by withholding his medication.

393
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,832
Mrs Palmer indicated to our detectives

394
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:01,911
that she was not at the Milliken residence
this evening and that she was here with you.

395
00:33:01,946 --> 00:33:08,193
Mr President, my question is... was she?

396
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:16,200
Yes, she was.

397
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:24,068
- Thank you, Mr President.
- Thank you, Chief Hendricks.

398
00:33:24,103 --> 00:33:26,798
- Have a good night.
- Thank you, sir.

399
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:39,470
Is there a reason you can think of that would
prompt Mrs Milliken to accuse Mrs Palmer?

400
00:33:39,505 --> 00:33:43,194
People do inexplicable things
in a moment of crisis, Chief.

401
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,196
Yeah.

402
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,231
Good night.

403
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,392
Good night.

404
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:20,718
The police chief was just here.

405
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:23,991
And I told him
that you were here with me tonight.

406
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:31,073
- No one will ever know anything different.
- I will. What you've done is unforgivable.

407
00:34:31,108 --> 00:34:36,990
David, you called me precisely because
you needed someone to do your dirty work.

408
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:40,350
So don't turn around
and just try to wash your hands of this.

409
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:46,590
Don't you dare insinuate that I knew
what you were about to do. You took a life.

410
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:48,631
It's not that clear cut, David.

411
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:53,296
Yes, it is. Alan Milliken is dead
because of you.

412
00:34:53,331 --> 00:34:57,552
You needed help with Milliken
and I gave it to you.

413
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:02,297
Neither one of us had any idea
that it would work out like this.

414
00:35:02,332 --> 00:35:06,555
<i>So let's not forget it did work out.
In your Unauthorized.</i>

415
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,315
You should be thanking me.

416
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,715
I despise you for what you've done.

417
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:20,676
And I despise my role
in helping you get away with it.

418
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,956
Now get out of my sight.

419
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,552
I've got him. Are the follow cars in place?

420
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:54,077
<i>Affirmative, sir.
We have pursuit vehicles in position.</i>

421
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:17,277
Here's your money and travel papers.

422
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:26,789
Move!

423
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:52,672
Dammit! Get on the radio. Tell the follow
teams to cordon off this entire area.

424
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:56,232
I don't want anybody here
except the bomb squad and forensics.

425
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:00,429
<i>- This is Bauer.
- Hello, Jack.</i>

426
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:04,752
<i>I knew you were better than Amador,
but you're not better than me.</i>

427
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:07,800
Amador said you knew me. Who is this?

428
00:37:07,835 --> 00:37:09,676
First things first, Jack.

429
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:17,310
There are 11 other vials, each containing the
same amount of virus released at the hotel.

430
00:37:17,345 --> 00:37:21,916
I'll use them... the moment
my instructions aren't followed.

431
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:29,637
- What do you want? Money?
- I need to get in touch with a friend of yours.

432
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,150
Everything's gonna be OK.

433
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,391
Oh, my God.

434
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,798
Sir. I need Phillips.
You'll be OK.

435
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:51,075
They're lying to us. There's something wrong
inside the building. It's inside the building!

436
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:54,390
<i>Sir, calm down!</i>

437
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,989
<i> Everyone...
Out of my way!</i>

438
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,560
Hold it right there.

439
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:07,165
Step away from the window.

440
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,192
I said step away from the window!

441
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,960
If you try to leave, I will shoot you.

442
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,234
No, you won't.

443
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:11,634
<i>- Mr President, I have Jack Bauer for you.
- Thank you.</i>

444
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,199
<i>- Jack.
- Mr President.</i>

445
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:18,876
The man in possession of the virus
has demanded to speak with you.

446
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:24,479
We don't have a name yet, but if you don't
speak with him he'll release more of the virus.

447
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:30,072
Unfortunately, at this time I think you're
going to have to give in to his demands.

448
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,959
- I'll speak to him.
- Yes, sir. I'll connect you.

449
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:43,039
<i>-  You are now on with the president.
- I'll make this brief.</i>

450
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:47,557
As you are no doubt aware,
I am in possession of enough of the virus

451
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
to decimate a good portion
of the population of this country.

452
00:39:51,035 --> 00:39:56,632
And, as I've shown
at the Chandler Plaza Hotel,

453
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,230
I will do so,

454
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:03,439
unless you follow the instructions
you'll be receiving over the next few hours.

455
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:08,400
Do you understand, Mr President?

456
00:40:08,435 --> 00:40:10,765
I'm listening.

457
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:15,112
You are no longer in control of your country,

458
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:22,153
and if you do not use the full power
of your office to execute my wishes,

459
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:26,965
the virus will be released,

460
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,754
and it will be impossible to stop.

461
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,391
You'll be hearing from me.
