1
00:00:14,307 --> 00:00:17,341
- Has Bauer arrived at CTU?
- No, not yet.

2
00:00:17,425 --> 00:00:19,778
<i>I need you to clear an entrance.</i>

3
00:00:19,863 --> 00:00:21,977
Why are you tracking Jack Bauer?

4
00:00:22,062 --> 00:00:25,529
I'm sure if they're tracking Jack Bauer,
they have a reason.

5
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:30,293
This man is a professional assassin. He killed
Dr Paulson. Did you let him into CTU?!

6
00:00:30,376 --> 00:00:34,447
They told me he was here to place a tap
on one of the servers. That's all I knew.

7
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:36,888
- Who told you?
- The White House.

8
00:00:36,972 --> 00:00:38,802
Mr. Cummings.

9
00:00:39,251 --> 00:00:42,843
Palmer was murdered because
he was about to expose Cummings' link.

10
00:00:42,929 --> 00:00:45,679
You want the gas,
Cummings is your connection.

11
00:00:45,767 --> 00:00:48,916
Cummings is the president's chief advisor.
How do we get to him?

12
00:00:49,004 --> 00:00:50,641
I secretly meet Mike Novick.

13
00:00:51,044 --> 00:00:54,750
- Who did you tell? Who did you tell?
- I didn't tell anybody, Jack.

14
00:00:54,841 --> 00:00:59,832
- Tell your men to stand down!
- Sorry, sir, we can't do that.

15
00:01:00,318 --> 00:01:02,910
The gas is being smuggled out by separatists

16
00:01:02,995 --> 00:01:05,633
who think they're going to use it
against Russians.

17
00:01:05,714 --> 00:01:09,421
- However, it will never reach Russian soil.
- And you know this how?

18
00:01:09,512 --> 00:01:12,229
We control the remote detonators
on those canisters.

19
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:16,220
As soon as they reach the terrorist base,
we'll trigger the canisters.

20
00:01:16,307 --> 00:01:18,978
- You're a traitor.
- Let things play out as they are.

21
00:01:19,066 --> 00:01:24,216
Otherwise, your administration will be
implicated, and your presidency destroyed.

22
00:01:24,662 --> 00:01:28,448
Mr. President, my name is Jack Bauer.
I'm sorry to confront you like this.

23
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:34,088
But your chief of staff is withholding
information vital to this nation's security.

24
00:01:34,655 --> 00:01:36,406
Stop this!

25
00:01:36,495 --> 00:01:42,839
I'm done talking with you, understand?
So, for the last time, where is the nerve gas?

26
00:01:42,931 --> 00:01:45,648
Stop. Stop! Stop! I'll tell you. I'll tell you.

27
00:01:45,729 --> 00:01:48,560
It's on a freighter
leaving the port of Long Beach at 2:30.

28
00:01:48,967 --> 00:01:52,559
CTU, we have located the target container.
No hostiles present.

29
00:01:52,644 --> 00:01:54,998
You have a green light.

30
00:01:55,083 --> 00:01:56,958
Open 'em up. Open 'em all up.

31
00:01:57,042 --> 00:02:00,430
Moving on, moving on.
What have we got? Nothing?

32
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:04,351
<i>There are no gas canisters here, CTU.
The nerve gas is not here.</i>

33
00:02:04,437 --> 00:02:07,189
- Where are the canisters?
- I've told you everything.

34
00:02:07,595 --> 00:02:10,983
We know you've altered the arming codes.

35
00:02:11,073 --> 00:02:13,585
Erwich, listen. We can negotiate something.

36
00:02:13,671 --> 00:02:17,184
I don't negotiate with my enemies.
I eliminate them.

37
00:02:17,268 --> 00:02:22,056
Your country is about to pay
a very steep price for betraying us.

38
00:02:29,621 --> 00:02:33,975
I was approached six months ago by a man
named James Nathanson. He was my contact.

39
00:02:34,058 --> 00:02:36,207
- Who is he?
- Former CIA.

40
00:02:36,297 --> 00:02:40,003
Said he was recruiting like-minded
individuals for this initiative.

41
00:02:40,094 --> 00:02:43,289
Initiative? Is that what you call this?

42
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:46,568
You helped terrorists
acquire weaponised nerve gas!

43
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:51,039
We were going to trigger the canisters
once they reached their base in central Asia.

44
00:02:51,127 --> 00:02:53,686
- This was not supposed to happen.
- It happened!

45
00:02:53,766 --> 00:02:57,836
You got into bed with them and they're
threatening to use the gas on US citizens.

46
00:02:57,923 --> 00:03:00,311
You say it like our goal was to kill Americans.

47
00:03:00,402 --> 00:03:03,994
What the hell was your goal, Walt?
Explain that to me.

48
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:10,508
We're patriots, Mr. President. We were
acting in the best interests of this country.

49
00:03:11,315 --> 00:03:14,862
How is any of this in our best interest?

50
00:03:14,953 --> 00:03:17,511
Shoring up a strategic partner
in the war on terror.

51
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:21,661
Ensuring a stable flow of oil. How is
any of that not in the national interest?

52
00:03:21,748 --> 00:03:24,579
<i>I have Chloe O'Brian
on the line for Jack Bauer.</i>

53
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:28,179
- Chloe, are you set up for the trace?
- All set, Jack.

54
00:03:28,264 --> 00:03:31,254
- We're ready to call Nathanson.
- How long do I keep him on?

55
00:03:31,342 --> 00:03:35,333
Until I give you a signal.
Chloe, dial the number.

56
00:03:39,217 --> 00:03:42,252
The line's disconnected.
There's nothing to grab onto.

57
00:03:42,335 --> 00:03:45,962
- He must know something went wrong.
- Dammit, Walt!

58
00:03:46,053 --> 00:03:49,407
I don't want this weapon deployed
on US soil any more than you do,

59
00:03:49,491 --> 00:03:52,844
but Nathanson cannot help you now
and neither can I.

60
00:03:52,929 --> 00:03:55,885
These terrorists are operating on their own.

61
00:03:58,325 --> 00:04:01,554
Mr. President, I think he's telling the truth.

62
00:04:01,643 --> 00:04:04,519
He can't help us, not any more.

63
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,188
Aaron.

64
00:04:09,278 --> 00:04:11,870
- Get him out of here.
- Yes, sir.

65
00:04:22,709 --> 00:04:24,381
Jack.

66
00:04:25,788 --> 00:04:29,937
- What do we do now?
- I need to be debriefed. After that I'm leaving.

67
00:04:30,025 --> 00:04:32,981
Given the situation,
things are more complicated.

68
00:04:33,063 --> 00:04:36,736
CTU is gonna have to be responsible
for retrieval of the canisters.

69
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,457
Why are you leaving?

70
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:42,326
Sir, I have a daughter
that doesn't know that I'm still alive.

71
00:04:42,418 --> 00:04:45,487
If I have to disappear again,
in all fairness to her,

72
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:48,407
I don't think she should know.

73
00:04:48,493 --> 00:04:53,689
Jack, terrorists just threatened
to deploy chemical weapons on US soil.

74
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:56,999
- They have the ability to kill millions.
- I understand that.

75
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:58,964
I believe that CTU can handle this.

76
00:04:59,046 --> 00:05:03,912
Jack, your experience could make
a crucial difference in stopping them.

77
00:05:04,003 --> 00:05:09,154
Look, you and I have a complicated history,
I realise that.

78
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:14,948
And I'm not naive enough to expect
any special personal allegiance from you.

79
00:05:15,037 --> 00:05:17,469
But I know your respect for this office

80
00:05:17,555 --> 00:05:21,830
is just as strong as it was
when you served under David Palmer.

81
00:05:21,912 --> 00:05:25,061
I'm asking for your help,
just until this crisis is over.

82
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:28,584
I will reinstate you.
I will give you all the support you need.

83
00:05:28,668 --> 00:05:32,578
- Mr. President, you and I...
- Jack, please! For God's sake!

84
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:37,134
We need to recover this nerve gas
before it's too late.

85
00:05:43,059 --> 00:05:45,651
The microcircuitry on this
has been tampered with.

86
00:05:45,737 --> 00:05:49,568
As far as I can tell, unless we can repair it,
we can't arm the canisters.

87
00:05:49,655 --> 00:05:53,361
Rossler will have a way.
He should have called by now.

88
00:05:53,452 --> 00:05:57,762
Our real enemy is Russia. We should
be figuring out another way to get back home,

89
00:05:57,849 --> 00:06:02,796
not wasting time
trying to use the gas against the Americans.

90
00:06:05,485 --> 00:06:08,714
Question my orders again and I will kill you.
You understand?

91
00:06:08,802 --> 00:06:13,270
They've closed the ports.
They will hunt us until they find us.

92
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:18,874
So if we cannot use the gas against Russia,
we will use it against America.

93
00:06:19,516 --> 00:06:21,505
Get up.

94
00:06:32,387 --> 00:06:34,820
<i>- Hello.
- Lynn.</i>

95
00:06:34,906 --> 00:06:40,216
- Jenny, now is a really bad time.
- I know you're busy, but I need to see you.

96
00:06:40,303 --> 00:06:43,213
- What is it?
- I need some help.

97
00:06:43,301 --> 00:06:46,211
- You mean money.
- Lynn, I'm clean.

98
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:51,968
I'm working two jobs and busting my ass
to put my life back together.

99
00:06:52,055 --> 00:06:55,329
<i>- How much?
- 500.</i>

100
00:06:55,413 --> 00:06:57,607
Can I... can I come over there?

101
00:06:57,692 --> 00:06:59,329
Absolutely not.

102
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:02,844
Why? Are you afraid I'll embarrass you?

103
00:07:02,929 --> 00:07:04,963
Yeah, I am.

104
00:07:05,047 --> 00:07:08,196
Lynn, I got nobody else to turn to. I just...

105
00:07:08,285 --> 00:07:11,753
You know, I can't go back on the street again.

106
00:07:11,842 --> 00:07:15,595
If you don't help me, I swear I...
I'm gonna hurt myself.

107
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,829
<i>For God's sake, Lynn, I'm your sister.</i>

108
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:19,954
Listen.

109
00:07:20,038 --> 00:07:21,629
Jenny, listen.

110
00:07:21,716 --> 00:07:25,912
There's a parking lot across from CTU.
I'll meet you there in 20 minutes.

111
00:07:25,994 --> 00:07:27,312
OK.

112
00:07:27,393 --> 00:07:29,269
Thank you, Lynn.

113
00:07:37,747 --> 00:07:39,815
- The numbers we...
- Sorry I'm late.

114
00:07:39,905 --> 00:07:45,692
I was explaining that Cummings provided us
with a schematic of one of the canisters.

115
00:07:45,781 --> 00:07:50,613
Triggering mechanisms on the canisters
can only be activated via satellite relay.

116
00:07:50,698 --> 00:07:53,813
Cummings says the terrorists
have invalid detonation codes.

117
00:07:53,896 --> 00:07:57,807
- The canisters are useless.
- Unless they find a way to control the trigger.

118
00:07:57,894 --> 00:08:03,601
- Are we running evacuation scenarios?
- Not without a time frame or a target.

119
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:06,077
Erwich's threat was intentionally vague.

120
00:08:06,168 --> 00:08:08,839
- What are we doing to track them?
Chloe.

121
00:08:08,927 --> 00:08:13,281
I pulled a voiceprint from Erwich's call
and I'm doing a scan of all Satcom chatter.

122
00:08:13,364 --> 00:08:17,673
If he is in contact with anyone, we should
be able to intercept and trace the call.

123
00:08:17,761 --> 00:08:21,513
We'd better get lucky cos we just got
an assessment from Civil Defense.

124
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,032
They estimate
the nerve gas from each canister

125
00:08:24,117 --> 00:08:27,107
will create kill zones
between one and three square miles.

126
00:08:27,195 --> 00:08:29,832
The terrorists
are in possession of 20 canisters.

127
00:08:29,913 --> 00:08:34,745
We're talking about potential casualties in
the hundreds of thousands, perhaps a million.

128
00:08:38,907 --> 00:08:41,625
<i>- Yeah.
- Ivan Erwich?</i>

129
00:08:41,706 --> 00:08:44,377
- Go ahead.
- Jacob Rossler.

130
00:08:44,464 --> 00:08:46,817
I was asked to call you by a friend in Moscow.

131
00:08:46,903 --> 00:08:48,937
You've been briefed on our situation?

132
00:08:49,022 --> 00:08:54,854
You need to reconfigure the remote trigger
for an A-tox chemical delivery system, right?

133
00:08:54,937 --> 00:08:57,689
- Yes.
- You have the canisters with you?

134
00:08:57,776 --> 00:08:58,764
<i>Yes.</i>

135
00:08:58,855 --> 00:09:03,607
<i>You'll need to start by cutting into them.
I'll give you the specifications.</i>

136
00:09:05,371 --> 00:09:07,406
<i>- O'Brian.
- We got a pattern.</i>

137
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:10,127
Send me the hit.

138
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:13,835
All interagency search protocols
are being run through CTU.

139
00:09:13,926 --> 00:09:16,279
Ken, no one is going around you.

140
00:09:16,364 --> 00:09:20,832
- We'll make sure you're apprised in real time.
- Audrey, I thought you should know.

141
00:09:20,921 --> 00:09:24,878
Logan asked for Jack to be reinstated
provisionally with full autonomy.

142
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:28,551
We got a possible intercept on Erwich.
This just happened.

143
00:09:28,637 --> 00:09:32,786
<i>On the inner casing, you will find
a display with a seven-digit readout.</i>

144
00:09:32,874 --> 00:09:36,307
<i>- I'll need that.
- Then what?</i>

145
00:09:36,391 --> 00:09:40,143
<i>Then I will program
a new chip for your remote tracker.</i>

146
00:09:40,229 --> 00:09:44,299
- Put me through to Jack Bauer.
- Voiceprint is a 95% % match. It's Erwich.

147
00:09:44,387 --> 00:09:48,820
He was on a sat phone. I can't trace it,
but it originated from a land line downtown.

148
00:09:48,904 --> 00:09:52,894
<i>- I have Jack Bauer for you, sir.
- This is Bauer.</i>

149
00:09:52,981 --> 00:09:55,971
<i>- Jack, we may have a lead on Erwich.
- I'm listening.</i>

150
00:09:56,059 --> 00:09:59,367
We intercepted a call
between Erwich and an unknown associate.

151
00:09:59,457 --> 00:10:02,925
We weren't able to trace Erwich,
but may have the associate.

152
00:10:03,015 --> 00:10:05,447
22 North Figueroa, a penthouse.

153
00:10:05,533 --> 00:10:08,523
- Chloe, bring up the building manifest.
- On it.

154
00:10:08,611 --> 00:10:11,999
From what we heard,
Erwich is trying to acquire an activation code.

155
00:10:12,089 --> 00:10:17,876
He's reconfiguring the trigger to disperse
the Sentox. We're running out of time.

156
00:10:17,965 --> 00:10:22,513
OK, the penthouse is leased to a man
named Jacob Rossler. Cross-checking.

157
00:10:22,602 --> 00:10:27,434
He's a software programmer indicted for
security code infiltration, identity theft.

158
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,827
I need schematics on the building
and vectors for every entrance.

159
00:10:30,917 --> 00:10:32,827
We'll have it for you.

160
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:36,701
We're gonna need to go in covertly.
Have Curtis meet me with a small team,

161
00:10:36,793 --> 00:10:40,749
but tell them to stay out of sight
until I get there. We'll be in touch.

162
00:10:40,831 --> 00:10:46,265
This is our new destination.
They'll clear a landing zone for you.

163
00:10:46,947 --> 00:10:50,494
This building's security system
uses proprietary technology.

164
00:10:50,585 --> 00:10:53,972
It's a high-end platform
that's a bitch to hack into.

165
00:10:54,062 --> 00:10:56,529
- So get Edgar to help you.
- Spenser is better.

166
00:10:56,621 --> 00:11:01,089
- Chloe, out of the question.
- Spenser can do this faster than Edgar and I.

167
00:11:01,177 --> 00:11:04,771
- He wrote a code that took months to hack.
That's a bad idea.

168
00:11:04,856 --> 00:11:09,210
Stay out of this! He didn't know Cummings
was dirty. His polygraph proved that.

169
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:12,681
He was spying on us.
He was spying on you. He lied to you.

170
00:11:12,771 --> 00:11:18,205
Sir, if you don't let Spenser help us do this,
we're not gonna get it done in time.

171
00:11:20,085 --> 00:11:23,520
He has to wear a security wristband
and be under supervision.

172
00:11:23,604 --> 00:11:25,594
Fine.

173
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,387
<i>- Audrey Raines.
- Audrey, it's Jack.</i>

174
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:39,427
I wanted to tell you the president asked me
to stay on until the canisters were retrieved.

175
00:11:39,514 --> 00:11:43,709
Jack, you know what this means.
You'll be exposed. CTU can handle the crisis.

176
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:47,940
<i>- The president thinks I can help.
- Jack, you don't owe them this.</i>

177
00:11:48,508 --> 00:11:51,305
The reason I called,
I need to ask you to do me a favour.

178
00:11:51,386 --> 00:11:52,784
What?

179
00:11:52,865 --> 00:11:57,573
- Kim doesn't know I'm alive yet.
- Do you want me to tell her?

180
00:11:57,662 --> 00:12:01,448
No, I want you to call and bring her into CTU.
I'll see her when I get back.

181
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:04,495
<i>- All right.
- Are you sure you're comfortable doing this?</i>

182
00:12:04,578 --> 00:12:07,726
<i>- Of course.
- Thank you.</i>

183
00:12:07,815 --> 00:12:09,134
Sure.

184
00:12:25,484 --> 00:12:27,872
Your swing arm needs to be replaced.

185
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:39,428
Yeah, we're open till five. Okey-doke.
Can I help you?

186
00:12:39,516 --> 00:12:43,904
Do you have some kind of precision tool
for cutting metal?

187
00:12:43,993 --> 00:12:46,267
- Sure.
- Where is everyone else?

188
00:12:46,351 --> 00:12:48,341
Lunch. Why?

189
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:52,825
I need you to do some work for us
and we need it done fast.

190
00:12:52,907 --> 00:12:57,420
- If you do it, you'll live, do you understand?
- Yeah. Yeah. Just take it easy.

191
00:12:57,505 --> 00:12:59,494
Get the canisters.

192
00:13:12,934 --> 00:13:16,925
Why haven't I gotten an update?
Bauer left here on some sort of lead.

193
00:13:17,012 --> 00:13:19,730
Find out if CTU is any closer
to recovering the gas.

194
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:21,800
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

195
00:13:27,645 --> 00:13:30,078
How are you feeling?

196
00:13:30,164 --> 00:13:31,721
Remarkably well...

197
00:13:31,803 --> 00:13:35,793
for someone whose husband tried
to have her committed without a goodbye.

198
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,995
I'm sorry.

199
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:40,637
I didn't come here to fight with you.

200
00:13:42,276 --> 00:13:44,345
You have every right to.

201
00:13:47,953 --> 00:13:51,420
The two of us used to be a pretty good team.

202
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:53,704
Do you remember?

203
00:13:55,508 --> 00:13:59,976
I was the one you would
always come to first for advice.

204
00:14:00,824 --> 00:14:05,611
- I remember.
- We've got to get back to that relationship.

205
00:14:06,301 --> 00:14:08,894
You're right.
Things are gonna get rough for you.

206
00:14:08,979 --> 00:14:14,369
And you are gonna need me
and everything that I can give you.

207
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:20,445
I don't know what to say, Marty.

208
00:14:24,529 --> 00:14:27,485
Don't you ever do that to me again.

209
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:36,959
Mike, please, come in.

210
00:14:38,401 --> 00:14:41,789
- Mr. President. Mrs. Logan.
- Mike.

211
00:14:41,878 --> 00:14:44,437
Mike, I owe you a profound apology.

212
00:14:44,517 --> 00:14:47,984
You were in an impossible situation.
I understand what you did.

213
00:14:48,074 --> 00:14:51,668
No. I panicked, Mike. That's it.

214
00:14:51,752 --> 00:14:54,139
Plain and simple.

215
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:56,743
I'm not proud of how I handled myself.

216
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:59,944
I intend to make it right from this point on.

217
00:15:01,307 --> 00:15:04,694
- I would like you to resume your duties.
- Of course, sir.

218
00:15:04,784 --> 00:15:06,659
Thank you, Mike.

219
00:15:08,102 --> 00:15:14,651
CTU is tracking down the canisters, but we
have to deal with the issue of Cummings.

220
00:15:15,177 --> 00:15:19,645
It's all right, Mike.
I would like Martha's input on this.

221
00:15:19,734 --> 00:15:24,088
So, what do we do about Walt?
We can't detain him indefinitely.

222
00:15:24,172 --> 00:15:27,845
We keep him out of sight long enough
to construct a credible narrative.

223
00:15:27,929 --> 00:15:29,566
Mike,

224
00:15:29,648 --> 00:15:32,241
are you talking about a cover-up?

225
00:15:32,326 --> 00:15:37,602
I mean exercising discretion to spare
this country unnecessary humiliation.

226
00:15:37,683 --> 00:15:42,037
Walt Cummings was complicit
in David Palmer's assassination.

227
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:47,238
He has allowed terrorists to get their hands
on gas that is, at this point, a very real threat.

228
00:15:47,317 --> 00:15:49,511
With respect, Mrs. Logan,

229
00:15:49,595 --> 00:15:54,461
if we go public, the president's reputation
won't be the only casualty.

230
00:15:54,552 --> 00:15:58,509
The credibility of this office will be destroyed.

231
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:02,342
Charles, you are going to take a hit on this,
but it won't destroy you.

232
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:06,304
You did nothing wrong
except to trust someone who betrayed you.

233
00:16:06,385 --> 00:16:08,579
You are human.

234
00:16:08,663 --> 00:16:12,540
You might be overestimating
the public's capacity for forgiveness.

235
00:16:12,621 --> 00:16:17,976
I'm not. The only thing
they won't forgive is being lied to.

236
00:16:18,058 --> 00:16:24,050
I think you should issue a statement
to the press. And the sooner the better.

237
00:16:26,092 --> 00:16:27,683
I agree.

238
00:16:27,772 --> 00:16:31,967
Why don't you and I work on it together
and see what we come up with?

239
00:16:32,049 --> 00:16:33,242
OK.

240
00:16:39,724 --> 00:16:41,202
Chloe.

241
00:16:41,283 --> 00:16:45,558
- Station three. We don't have much time.
- Thanks for getting me reinstated.

242
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:48,597
I did it cos I need help
getting Jack through the building,

243
00:16:48,678 --> 00:16:50,986
not because I forgive you, because I don't.

244
00:16:51,077 --> 00:16:55,704
Have a seat. We need to gain access
to the security server at 22 North Figueroa.

245
00:16:55,793 --> 00:16:59,262
It's a proprietary network so get to work.

246
00:17:03,469 --> 00:17:09,335
- Chloe, I swear, I thought I was following...
- I don't care, Spenser.

247
00:17:41,445 --> 00:17:44,276
CTU. They've got eyes and ears
on the building.

248
00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:48,672
We've got two units.
One east, one west of the building.

249
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,431
Chloe, do you copy?

250
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:55,429
We're here. Spenser's countervailing
the building's security protocol.

251
00:17:55,516 --> 00:17:58,153
What? Spenser's under arrest.

252
00:17:58,234 --> 00:18:02,270
- Buchanan released him from Holding.
- Fine. Give me Rossler's position.

253
00:18:03,551 --> 00:18:08,258
I've hacked into the building's motion
sensors. Rossler is still in the penthouse.

254
00:18:08,348 --> 00:18:11,145
I have two guards on the penthouse level.

255
00:18:11,226 --> 00:18:14,933
<i>- What about the ground-level entrance?
- One guard, three cameras.</i>

256
00:18:15,023 --> 00:18:19,458
Stand by to take out all security cameras
covering the front desk and the elevators.

257
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:24,214
I can only shut them down for 60 seconds,
then they reboot. That's as long as you have.

258
00:18:24,298 --> 00:18:27,606
Copy that. Teams A and B,
remain in position till you get a go.

259
00:18:27,696 --> 00:18:33,688
We are one minute out. We have to cross
the street to get to Rossler's building.

260
00:18:38,129 --> 00:18:40,562
We are ready to cut into the canisters.

261
00:18:40,647 --> 00:18:45,718
You have to cut precisely ten centimetres
from the bottom of the casing

262
00:18:45,804 --> 00:18:47,794
to reveal the trigger.

263
00:18:47,883 --> 00:18:49,838
How thick is the outer casing?

264
00:18:49,922 --> 00:18:55,197
<i>Five millimetres. Call me with the ID numbers
when you're done.</i>

265
00:19:11,748 --> 00:19:15,102
We're in position.
We're set. We're ready to go.

266
00:19:16,146 --> 00:19:18,293
Just a few more seconds.

267
00:19:20,582 --> 00:19:22,458
OK. Here we go, Jack.

268
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:25,690
On my mark, cameras dark.

269
00:19:28,377 --> 00:19:31,651
Federal agent. Let me see your hands.
Let me see your hands!

270
00:19:31,736 --> 00:19:33,804
Elevator code, let's have it.

271
00:19:33,894 --> 00:19:36,611
Four, zero, seven, three, pound.

272
00:19:36,693 --> 00:19:40,126
Unit one, status check. Lost cameras A and C.

273
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:45,883
Tell him you don't know why the cameras
went down, but everything is OK.

274
00:19:45,966 --> 00:19:50,718
Base, status check blue. Don't know why the
cameras are out. Everything's fine down here.

275
00:19:50,804 --> 00:19:52,633
Turn around.

276
00:19:52,722 --> 00:19:55,280
Back up to me. Back up to me.

277
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,351
- Where are the elevators?
- Almost there. You have two floors to go.

278
00:19:59,438 --> 00:20:03,713
The camera reboots in ten seconds.
Then you'll be visible.

279
00:20:06,073 --> 00:20:07,869
Move. Move.

280
00:20:17,346 --> 00:20:19,734
Unit one, status check. Where are you?

281
00:20:20,985 --> 00:20:23,621
You tell him you had to use the men's room.

282
00:20:24,263 --> 00:20:26,615
Base, headed to the men's room.

283
00:20:33,616 --> 00:20:35,606
Something's wrong.

284
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:46,606
- Yes.
- Mr. Rossler, we may have a situation.

285
00:20:46,688 --> 00:20:51,077
- What kind of situation?
- I'm not sure. Please remain in your office.

286
00:20:53,963 --> 00:20:57,237
The guards look suspicious.
One has an automatic weapon.

287
00:20:57,321 --> 00:20:58,800
Copy that.

288
00:21:01,479 --> 00:21:03,308
Federal agent!

289
00:21:06,995 --> 00:21:10,303
- You OK?
- Yeah. Go ahead. It hit my vest.

290
00:21:12,072 --> 00:21:13,709
- Rossler's on the move.
- Where?

291
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:16,064
Nine o'clock.

292
00:21:22,985 --> 00:21:27,420
Federal agent.
Drop the weapon. Drop the weapon!

293
00:21:27,502 --> 00:21:30,378
Put your hands behind your head.

294
00:21:30,461 --> 00:21:32,131
Do it!

295
00:21:32,219 --> 00:21:34,288
Interlock your fingers.

296
00:21:38,935 --> 00:21:41,686
Rossler is in custody.
Repeat, Rossler is in custody.

297
00:21:41,773 --> 00:21:45,524
<i>- Move in. I need a medic.
- Patching you to situation room.</i>

298
00:21:45,611 --> 00:21:51,603
- Someone else is in the penthouse, Jack.
- In the bedroom. To your right. North side.

299
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:55,997
- Curtis, cover him.
- I got him.

300
00:22:00,841 --> 00:22:04,592
Let me see your hands.
Let me see your hands!

301
00:22:07,397 --> 00:22:09,670
Don't shoot.

302
00:22:11,834 --> 00:22:15,745
- Who are you?
- I'm Inessa.

303
00:22:15,832 --> 00:22:18,583
Who did that to you?

304
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:22,899
- You are the police?
- Counter Terrorist Unit, Los Angeles.

305
00:22:23,507 --> 00:22:26,178
He is holding me here.

306
00:22:32,661 --> 00:22:35,127
I want to go home.

307
00:22:51,353 --> 00:22:56,141
You need to cut into the outer casing
exactly ten centimetres from the bottom.

308
00:22:56,231 --> 00:23:01,460
The casing is five millimetres thick.
You cannot puncture the inner lining.

309
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:05,902
- What's in these things?
- Do not worry. Just do what I say.

310
00:23:05,985 --> 00:23:09,941
Just... Can't you tell me what this is all about?

311
00:23:10,022 --> 00:23:12,216
Do you have a family, Cal?

312
00:23:12,301 --> 00:23:13,812
A wife.

313
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:17,936
My wife is in prison.
She's been there for seven years.

314
00:23:19,976 --> 00:23:24,251
Her only crime was to support me
while I fought for my country.

315
00:23:24,333 --> 00:23:28,960
My son lives in a state-run facility.
He does not even remember what I look like.

316
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:31,517
You want to know what this is about?

317
00:23:31,609 --> 00:23:35,121
It's about justice. It's about ending tyranny.

318
00:23:36,845 --> 00:23:39,915
When you're finished, we will leave.

319
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:45,829
- You won't hurt me?
- You're not my enemy.

320
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:48,671
Your government is my enemy.

321
00:23:48,758 --> 00:23:50,748
Hey.

322
00:23:50,836 --> 00:23:53,030
You have my word.

323
00:23:57,712 --> 00:23:59,701
Begin.

324
00:24:24,375 --> 00:24:27,171
It's all right. You're all right.

325
00:24:28,173 --> 00:24:32,322
All right, alpha team,
the building is secure.

326
00:24:33,689 --> 00:24:35,679
Take a seat.

327
00:24:37,886 --> 00:24:40,444
You're safe now.

328
00:24:42,963 --> 00:24:47,875
Get a medic to have a look at her.
I want CTU to run a full background check.

329
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:53,953
I don't mind that they've dressed his wound,
but don't give him anything for the pain.

330
00:24:59,153 --> 00:25:01,188
Curtis, put him in a chair.

331
00:25:01,272 --> 00:25:03,864
All right, let's go. Get him up.

332
00:25:08,667 --> 00:25:10,657
Easy on my leg.

333
00:25:16,343 --> 00:25:19,014
My name is Jack Bauer. I'm with CTU.

334
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:23,727
25 minutes ago, you contacted a man named
Ivan Erwich. What did he want you to do?

335
00:25:23,817 --> 00:25:27,694
- I want my lawyer.
- You'll get a lawyer when I get what I need.

336
00:25:27,775 --> 00:25:31,561
Mr. Erwich is in possession
of 20 canisters of Sentox VX nerve gas,

337
00:25:31,653 --> 00:25:35,245
which he has threatened to deploy
here in the United States.

338
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:37,923
I guess you have a problem.

339
00:25:40,486 --> 00:25:44,797
No, you have a problem. You've been
conspiring with and aiding a known terrorist,

340
00:25:44,884 --> 00:25:48,113
which means I get to hold you
for as long as I want.

341
00:25:48,202 --> 00:25:52,751
Mr. Erwich can't deploy the canisters unless
he reconfigures the trigger mechanism.

342
00:25:52,839 --> 00:25:55,068
Is that what he wanted you to do?

343
00:25:56,917 --> 00:26:01,589
Trust me. You don't want
to go down this road with me.

344
00:26:01,674 --> 00:26:04,311
Go to hell.

345
00:26:06,791 --> 00:26:08,780
Agh!

346
00:26:10,868 --> 00:26:15,575
That is exactly where I'm going to send you
unless you start to cooperate.

347
00:26:17,863 --> 00:26:20,614
You like hurting girls?

348
00:26:20,701 --> 00:26:23,134
Curtis.

349
00:26:24,659 --> 00:26:29,571
<i>By the time I'm finished with you,
you're gonna wish you felt this good again.</i>

350
00:26:29,656 --> 00:26:31,646
Where is Erwich?

351
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:43,236
I want full immunity,

352
00:26:43,327 --> 00:26:45,839
unfreezing of all my assets,

353
00:26:45,926 --> 00:26:49,552
and transport
to a foreign country of my choosing.

354
00:26:50,243 --> 00:26:52,233
No.

355
00:26:53,081 --> 00:26:54,911
And Inessa.

356
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,068
She comes with me.

357
00:26:57,158 --> 00:26:59,546
That's the deal.

358
00:26:59,637 --> 00:27:03,310
Maybe I'm not making myself clear.
We're not making a deal.

359
00:27:03,395 --> 00:27:05,827
Curtis.

360
00:27:11,869 --> 00:27:15,416
- Jack, it's Lynn.
- Go ahead.

361
00:27:15,507 --> 00:27:18,178
We don't have the luxury
to engage in brinkmanship.

362
00:27:18,265 --> 00:27:22,335
- He's gonna tell us what we want to know.
- We're not gonna wait to find out.

363
00:27:22,423 --> 00:27:25,060
Accept the deal. That's an order.

364
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:27,856
Fine. It's your call.

365
00:27:27,939 --> 00:27:30,168
We're signing off.

366
00:27:31,177 --> 00:27:35,326
Make sure he follows through.
I'll be back in a few minutes.

367
00:27:50,565 --> 00:27:53,635
I've been instructed to accept your proposal.

368
00:27:54,682 --> 00:27:57,195
A certified agreement,

369
00:27:57,281 --> 00:27:59,713
signed by the attorney general.

370
00:27:59,799 --> 00:28:03,152
When I see that, I'll tell you what you want.

371
00:28:03,237 --> 00:28:06,113
And remember, I want Inessa.

372
00:28:21,186 --> 00:28:24,256
Your agreement's being drawn up.
Now I want something.

373
00:28:24,344 --> 00:28:26,981
Where's Erwich?

374
00:28:27,062 --> 00:28:29,574
I have no idea.

375
00:28:29,661 --> 00:28:32,173
I don't know the man.

376
00:28:32,259 --> 00:28:34,408
Not even what he looks like.

377
00:28:34,498 --> 00:28:37,408
I first spoke with him 30 minutes ago.

378
00:28:37,496 --> 00:28:41,372
We were put in contact
through a mutual associate in Russia.

379
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:44,682
- Who?
- Sergei Voronov.

380
00:28:44,771 --> 00:28:46,919
A commander in the resistance movement.

381
00:28:47,009 --> 00:28:51,318
- What does Erwich want?
- To reprogram the chip of that trigger.

382
00:28:51,407 --> 00:28:53,966
He's calling back
with the identification keys.

383
00:28:54,045 --> 00:28:57,036
- What's your time frame?
- Within the hour.

384
00:28:57,123 --> 00:28:59,795
How is he going to receive the package?

385
00:29:00,801 --> 00:29:05,633
I was going to deliver it.
We haven't agreed on the meeting place.

386
00:29:06,677 --> 00:29:08,507
I want that chip.

387
00:29:09,915 --> 00:29:12,030
It's in a safe place.

388
00:29:12,114 --> 00:29:15,388
Once I see some paperwork,

389
00:29:15,472 --> 00:29:17,620
I'll show it to you.

390
00:29:20,229 --> 00:29:26,221
I want you to be ready to fit that chip
with a transponder so we can track him.

391
00:29:31,941 --> 00:29:33,851
- Buchanan.
- Bill, it's Jack.

392
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:36,008
Where are we with Rossler's agreement?

393
00:29:36,098 --> 00:29:40,169
We have the attorney general's sanction.
You should have it in a few minutes.

394
00:29:40,256 --> 00:29:44,883
- Did we get any information on the girl?
- There isn't much. Inessa Kovalesky.

395
00:29:44,973 --> 00:29:47,326
Reported missing 19 months ago from Kiev.

396
00:29:47,412 --> 00:29:51,448
The assumption is she was kidnapped
by traffickers in the sex-slave trade.

397
00:29:51,529 --> 00:29:53,598
She's 15, Jack.

398
00:29:53,688 --> 00:29:55,881
15?

399
00:29:59,084 --> 00:30:02,040
OK, thanks, Bill. I'll get back to you.

400
00:30:18,232 --> 00:30:20,665
- You can't take the girl.
- Then no deal.

401
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:26,105
You'll have your immunity, your freedom.
Leave the girl out of this.

402
00:30:26,187 --> 00:30:28,824
Inessa is all I care about.

403
00:30:29,824 --> 00:30:32,576
She comes with me,

404
00:30:32,662 --> 00:30:35,129
or you lose Erwich.

405
00:30:48,973 --> 00:30:51,201
I've almost finished the protocols.

406
00:30:51,291 --> 00:30:54,123
Whatever you have,
port it over to Edgar's station.

407
00:30:54,209 --> 00:30:56,641
- Why?
- He'll be finishing that task.

408
00:30:56,728 --> 00:30:59,320
Fine.

409
00:30:59,406 --> 00:31:02,760
- Chloe, don't you understand?
- I know.

410
00:31:03,723 --> 00:31:06,679
I'll bet you do.

411
00:31:06,762 --> 00:31:11,434
You don't work here any more, Spenser.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

412
00:31:11,518 --> 00:31:15,031
Your reinstatement was just until
we got Rossler into custody.

413
00:31:15,116 --> 00:31:19,152
- There's still stuff that has to be done.
- We pulled people from Division.

414
00:31:19,234 --> 00:31:21,462
These men will escort you out.

415
00:31:37,382 --> 00:31:39,769
I know that was hard. You did the right thing.

416
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:41,850
Shut up, Edgar.

417
00:31:48,415 --> 00:31:50,689
You're right, we don't need that part.

418
00:31:50,774 --> 00:31:52,252
OK.

419
00:31:52,332 --> 00:31:55,447
"I promise a full and open inquiry
into this matter. "

420
00:31:55,531 --> 00:32:00,362
"I will not rest until I've restored the faith
that you have placed in this office. "

421
00:32:00,447 --> 00:32:05,677
"And I can demonstrate to you, the American
people, that I bear its mantle of responsibility

422
00:32:05,764 --> 00:32:09,357
with respect and deep humility. "

423
00:32:09,441 --> 00:32:12,910
This way, you're assuming responsibility
for Walt's actions,

424
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:18,832
but you're also personally
taking the initiative to bring him to justice.

425
00:32:18,915 --> 00:32:22,542
Well, I'd like to run it by Mike,
but I think it works.

426
00:32:22,633 --> 00:32:25,509
I think it's the right move, Charles.

427
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:29,745
Thank you for letting me help you.

428
00:32:29,829 --> 00:32:34,820
I'm glad to have your help. It's been a long
time since you and I worked together like this.

429
00:32:38,344 --> 00:32:39,617
Yes.

430
00:32:39,703 --> 00:32:42,897
<i>- Mr. President, Mike.
- What is it, Mike?</i>

431
00:32:43,421 --> 00:32:46,536
<i>I think you should come here.
I'm in the west hallway.</i>

432
00:32:46,618 --> 00:32:49,653
- What's going on?
- Just come here, sir.

433
00:32:49,737 --> 00:32:51,726
<i>I'm on my way</i>

434
00:33:39,585 --> 00:33:41,734
Cut him down.

435
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:30,509
Thanks for meeting me. You got the money?

436
00:34:30,593 --> 00:34:33,025
Jenny, I'm not here to bring you money.

437
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:37,736
Here's the name of a doctor. He's a good man.

438
00:34:37,828 --> 00:34:42,535
I want you to call him. I'll pay all
the expenses. It won't cost you a cent.

439
00:34:42,625 --> 00:34:45,091
- We'll call him together.
- I can't.

440
00:34:45,623 --> 00:34:48,693
- Oh, God!
- Don't hurt him!

441
00:34:48,781 --> 00:34:51,851
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

442
00:34:57,375 --> 00:34:59,012
Hurry up.

443
00:35:01,333 --> 00:35:03,004
Let's go.

444
00:35:03,092 --> 00:35:05,809
- I'm so sorry, Lynn.
- Come on!

445
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:26,426
Rossler's been given a shot for the pain.
We have pursuit units on stand-by.

446
00:35:26,517 --> 00:35:28,552
As soon as he moves out, we'll be ready.

447
00:35:28,636 --> 00:35:32,183
No one's going anywhere unless Erwich calls.
Stand by the phones.

448
00:35:32,274 --> 00:35:34,263
Excuse me.

449
00:35:42,707 --> 00:35:46,936
<i>- Audrey Raines.
- It's me. Did you get a hold of Kim?</i>

450
00:35:47,024 --> 00:35:50,980
No. I tried her, but she wasn't in.
I left a message.

451
00:35:51,062 --> 00:35:53,813
- Would you mind trying again for me?
- Of course.

452
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:55,890
OK, thanks.

453
00:36:04,853 --> 00:36:07,570
I want to contact my family.

454
00:36:07,652 --> 00:36:10,369
They must be so worried about me.

455
00:36:11,528 --> 00:36:15,201
I need to explain something to you first.

456
00:36:16,846 --> 00:36:18,835
Please, sit down.

457
00:36:32,395 --> 00:36:34,783
For now...

458
00:36:34,874 --> 00:36:38,580
we need you to go with Mr. Rossler.

459
00:36:38,671 --> 00:36:41,104
Just for now.

460
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:45,420
Men like me - agents -
are going to follow you.

461
00:36:45,508 --> 00:36:47,895
And when we get
what we need from Mr. Rossler,

462
00:36:47,985 --> 00:36:52,579
they're going to move in
and they're going to take you away from him.

463
00:36:52,662 --> 00:36:55,573
You don't know what he does to me
when we are alone.

464
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:58,014
I promise I won't let him be alone with you.

465
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:00,691
- I don't believe you.
- Please.

466
00:37:00,778 --> 00:37:03,165
- I won't do it.
- Please.

467
00:37:06,294 --> 00:37:08,932
Let me go.

468
00:37:09,012 --> 00:37:11,605
- Please.
- I'm sorry, I can't.

469
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:15,326
Then you are no different than Rossler.

470
00:37:15,408 --> 00:37:17,716
I am not Rossler.

471
00:37:19,805 --> 00:37:22,398
Look at me.

472
00:37:23,483 --> 00:37:27,110
I won't let anything happen to you.

473
00:37:27,201 --> 00:37:29,190
I promise.

474
00:37:31,798 --> 00:37:34,674
We need you to get dressed, please.

475
00:37:39,553 --> 00:37:41,543
Thank you.

476
00:38:04,817 --> 00:38:07,205
Good job.

477
00:38:27,683 --> 00:38:30,275
That's it.

478
00:38:30,361 --> 00:38:33,634
Load the canisters. Get rid of the body.

479
00:38:51,828 --> 00:38:53,817
Pick it up.

480
00:38:55,425 --> 00:38:56,539
Yes.

481
00:38:56,624 --> 00:39:01,696
We have the identification keys.
I'm messaging them to you now.

482
00:39:01,781 --> 00:39:03,100
I've got them.

483
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:06,376
How long will it take
to reprogram the chip and deliver it?

484
00:39:06,458 --> 00:39:08,254
<i>I'll be ready in ten minutes.</i>

485
00:39:08,337 --> 00:39:11,293
<i>- We need a place we can meet.
- You're coming personally?</i>

486
00:39:11,375 --> 00:39:15,412
Unless you have someone who can install
and program an encoded binary chip.

487
00:39:15,492 --> 00:39:17,641
I'll call you back with the location.

488
00:39:17,731 --> 00:39:19,721
<i>I'll be here.</i>

489
00:39:23,567 --> 00:39:26,683
Get him set up for a wire. I'll get the girl.

490
00:39:26,765 --> 00:39:28,243
Yes, sir.

491
00:39:28,325 --> 00:39:33,395
Mr. Rossler, in a minute
we're gonna be implanting a transmitter.

492
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,911
We're ready to go.

493
00:39:41,795 --> 00:39:43,989
It's going to be fine.

494
00:39:56,466 --> 00:39:58,217
Let's go.

495
00:40:02,703 --> 00:40:08,695
We couldn't complete the trace, but we have it
narrowed down to a ten-block radius.

496
00:40:08,779 --> 00:40:11,053
No! No!

497
00:40:11,137 --> 00:40:13,092
No! Hold your fire.

498
00:40:15,215 --> 00:40:17,603
Get a medic in here now.

499
00:40:19,532 --> 00:40:21,919
Inessa, give me the gun.

500
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:25,604
I know you don't want to hurt anybody else.

501
00:40:28,966 --> 00:40:32,001
Is he gonna make it?

502
00:40:32,923 --> 00:40:35,482
No. He's dead.

503
00:40:35,562 --> 00:40:37,916
He was our only link to those canisters.

504
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:43,355
Erwich's gonna call here any minute
and he's gonna expect to talk to him.
