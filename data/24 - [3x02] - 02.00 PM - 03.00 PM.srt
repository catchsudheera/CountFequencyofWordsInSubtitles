1
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,918
<i>Someone just dropped off a dead body
infected with a virus.</i>

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,790
<i>Based on the autopsy, by the end of the first
week, nine per cent of LA will be infected.</i>

3
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:23,836
That's over a million people.

4
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,753
<i> We want the release
of Ramón Salazar.</i>

5
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:29,877
<i>If you refuse to comply,
the virus will be unleashed.</i>

6
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:33,270
You know Salazar better than anybody else
here. Who are we dealing with?

7
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,635
<i> His brother.
Hector was next in command.</i>

8
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:38,234
<i>He went underground
when Ramón was taken into custody.</i>

9
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,197
Have you made the call to the FBI?

10
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,474
Yes, I did.

11
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,632
- What about our boy?
- I'm watching him now.

12
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,870
What are you into here, man? Selling dope?

13
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,909
This guy paid me five grand to bring some
coke over the border. I did that last night.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,070
Today I drop it off, I get another five.

15
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,118
When did the FBI get this call?

16
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,476
- About 20 minutes ago.
- We don't know who we're dealing with?

17
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,996
- It was a scrambled voice on an open line.
- Do we cancel the debate?

18
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:05,958
They are discussing whether or not
we should stay in Los Angeles.

19
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,995
Chase, no day is a good day.

20
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:14,108
We said that we would tell him if we were still
together after two months. It's almost three.

21
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,191
Why don't we just get it over with?

22
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,318
Listen, Jack.
You were under with Salazar for six months.

23
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,075
I know what they did to you.
You look like hell.

24
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,355
I'm concerned about you, Jack.

25
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:30,433
The things you did to get me here,
I wouldn't wish on anyone.

26
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,955
<i>The president won't make any decisions
until he knows what we're dealing with,</i>

27
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,679
<i>so give me all the parameters, Tony.</i>

28
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,149
What we have here
is a terrorist demand.

29
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:15,472
Someone close to Salazar, we're guessing
his brother, is demanding his release.

30
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:20,588
If we don't comply, he'll initiate an outbreak
of a very deadly, fast-acting virus.

31
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,910
<i>How do we know they're in possession of it?</i>

32
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,673
Wayne, I've got Dr Sunny Macer on the line.

33
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,991
She's technical director
of National Health Services.

34
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:33,551
<i>Mr Palmer, about an hour ago, a dead body
was anonymously delivered to our office.</i>

35
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:37,633
<i>It was infected with a type III
pneumonic virus, deliberately introduced.</i>

36
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:42,794
<i>This virus kills within 24 hours of exposure
and there is no known antidote or vaccine.</i>

37
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:47,431
<i>What's particularly disturbing
is how fast it spreads. Take a look.</i>

38
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:53,709
<i>It's latent for several hours but once it
presents, it consumes the host rapidly.</i>

39
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:59,113
We will send you preliminary projections
of casualties in case something's unleashed.

40
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,909
And, Wayne, I gotta tell you,
it's pretty bleak.

41
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,516
<i>I don't understand this. I thought we knew
what biological threats were out there.</i>

42
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:12,355
<i>How do we find ourselves up against the wall
with something that isn't even on our radar?</i>

43
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:17,389
<i>This is a strain we've never seen. The autopsy
confirms someone has engineered this virus</i>

44
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:20,711
<i>to kill ten times faster
than its ordinary genotypes.</i>

45
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,836
<i>OK. OK, I see.</i>

46
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,956
<i>Sir, I can't underscore enough</i>

47
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,955
<i>how potentially devastating it would be
if this virus were released by terrorists.</i>

48
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,873
What options will the president be looking at?

49
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,317
<i>It's the unwavering policy of the US
to stand firm against any terrorist demands.</i>

50
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,755
<i>I know the president, Tony.</i>

51
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,833
<i>He will not free Salazar.
No matter what the threat.</i>

52
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,072
We can't waste any time
on standard protocol today.

53
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,550
We've been given five hours to comply.
If we're gonna stop this threat,

54
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,712
then CTU has to have every
possible resource at its disposal.

55
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:57,839
<i>- You'll have it.
- I'd like to get my team back to work.</i>

56
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,831
<i>- Understood.
- Thank you.</i>

57
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,716
<i>- Bauer.
- Dad, it's me.</i>

58
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,473
<i>- What, Kim?
- Adam and I just found something on Goss.</i>

59
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,949
We should have
an address for you pretty soon.

60
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,439
OK. Good work.

61
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,559
- And, Dad, remember I wanted to talk to you.
- Why? Is something wrong?

62
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:20,668
<i>No, I was just wondering if I could come up
for a few minutes. It's something personal.</i>

63
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:24,833
Sweetheart, now's not a good time. As soon
as I've got a moment, I'll come down, OK?

64
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,309
Yeah. Thanks.

65
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,800
They're getting close to Goss.

66
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,236
You didn't shoot up, did you?
You think you can hide it from me?

67
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,914
I'm not trying to hide it from you.
I'm trying to quit.

68
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,673
People don't just quit, Jack.

69
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:43,670
I've been tapering off. OK?
Now it's time to stop.

70
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:47,639
Doesn't look like it's time. Today is
not a good day for you to be needing a fix.

71
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:51,793
Why don't you go work with Chloe
and pin down a location on Hector Salazar?

72
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,235
What's wrong with
the methadone programme?

73
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,959
It takes a little time, but it works.

74
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:02,396
I am not going on record with this addiction,
do you understand me?

75
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,597
You're the only person who knows,
and it's gonna stay that way.

76
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,956
This is nothing to be ashamed of.
You did this in the line of duty.

77
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,112
Doing junk was the only way
to get close to Salazar.

78
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:17,638
I know what I did. This conversation's over.
Just get back to work.

79
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,199
Yeah.

80
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,396
- Chase.
- What?

81
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,040
I was playing back
the Health Services briefing.

82
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,714
- What about it?
- The government can't let this happen.

83
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,870
Salazar's just one person,
no matter how bad.

84
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:41,919
Forget that. We need to operate under
our orders and find the carrier of this virus.

85
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,437
Find the carrier? In the next four hours?
Come on, Chase, that's not likely, is it?

86
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:50,718
Not if we sit and debate it. Weren't you meant
to find a list of the Goss associates?

87
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,678
Kim's bringing it up now.

88
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,872
Great. Then go over the autopsy report.
See if there's anything they overlooked.

89
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,188
Fine.

90
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,148
Here are the files on Goss.

91
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:19,195
I heard you talking to your dad
when I was in his office.

92
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:24,512
- Why do you wanna tell him today?
- Cos it's not a big deal.

93
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:28,309
It is a big deal. Not only do I work for him,
but I'm also a field agent.

94
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,233
- It's the last thing he wants for you.
- How do you know?

95
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:34,630
I know. OK? I mean, he talks about things.

96
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:40,349
About how he was never there for you.
Or your mom.

97
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,232
He doesn't believe a field agent
can have a relationship.

98
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:48,710
Did you ever stop to think
that maybe it would make him happy?

99
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,349
That his daughter's
found someone she loves?

100
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,436
Look, I love you too.
I just don't think today's a good day.

101
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,512
Chase, I need you to copy me on that list.

102
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,713
- What's this column keyed off at?
- That's family and that's legal.

103
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,950
- Great.
- OK.

104
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,634
<i> I want you to cross-reference
those files with our Latin American files.</i>

105
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:24,350
Yes, I want all the names printed out. OK,
just get that intel over to my office. Thanks.

106
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,953
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey, sweetheart.

107
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:36,350
- You all right?
- Yeah. Why? What's going on?

108
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:39,557
Chase said you were really stressed out.

109
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,552
- Stressed? What do you mean, "stressed"?
- You know.

110
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,518
Salazar and the terrorist threat.

111
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,469
Yeah. Yeah, but I think we're gonna get it
under control. We just got a lot of work to do.

112
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,997
- Listen, can I talk to you now?
- Yeah. Yeah, sure. Come on in.

113
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,752
Take a seat.

114
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,228
Hey. What's going on?

115
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:13,754
After all we've been through,
I find it very difficult to keep things from you.

116
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,195
OK. What's up?

117
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:26,071
Chase and I have been going out for a while.
And it's starting to get serious.

118
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,193
Wow.

119
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:43,519
I think he wanted to be the one to tell you
but he was worried it would cause a problem.

120
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,878
I see.

121
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:53,435
How long have the two of you
been seeing each other?

122
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,636
Three months.

123
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,639
I really care for him, Dad.

124
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:10,551
So what do you think?

125
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,029
I don't know what I think.

126
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,394
I'm really surprised.

127
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,631
I'm sorry, I'm a little distracted
with everything going on...

128
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,631
I know, but...

129
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:27,756
- Forget it. I just had to let you know.
- No, I'm glad you told me. I am.

130
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,432
OK.

131
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,080
- I love you.
- Love you too.

132
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,550
Told him.

133
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,393
What did he say?

134
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,311
Nothing.

135
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,996
<i>- Dessler.
- It's Sunny. I have something that might help.</i>

136
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:09,074
We found something odd in Goss's system.
We found an unmetabolized virus particle.

137
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,880
I'll skip the technobabble. It looks like
the virus was delivered in a crystalline form.

138
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,633
Maybe what you're looking for
is a white powder.

139
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:22,191
- So it would look like cocaine? Or heroin?
- Yeah, that may even be the strategy.

140
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,716
Someone thinks they're selling coke,
but they're handling the virus.

141
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,118
Look, Kyle.

142
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:32,876
I'm not gonna do it. OK? I don't care
how much you pay me, it's dealing drugs.

143
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,997
You're my best friend.
You gotta come through for me here.

144
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:39,868
You should have talked to me before
you went to Mexico and bought the coke.

145
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,872
I only want you to wait in the car.
I'll make the delivery.

146
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:46,430
I'm not gonna do it.
I'm not gonna go with you.

147
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,468
Fine.

148
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,432
<i>- Yeah.
- It's Zach.</i>

149
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:56,398
<i>- Zach, hey. What's up?
- We need to talk.</i>

150
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,630
Hold on a second, man.

151
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,188
- Who's Zach?
- It's nobody.

152
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:04,033
What's with you today?
Everything's a secret.

153
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,873
He's got family stuff going on.

154
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,955
What's going on?

155
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,759
- You tell me. You got the powder?
- Yeah, of course I do.

156
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:15,389
- What time you want me to drop it off?
- Tonight. Come by around 7.30.

157
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:19,917
7.30, yeah. Can we just go over one more time
how this whole thing's gonna go down?

158
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,835
<i>Go over what? You drop off the coke, I give
you the money. Is that too much for you?</i>

159
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,639
No! No, no, that's totally cool, man.

160
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,836
It better be.

161
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,428
- Yeah.
- It's Michelle.

162
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:57,354
We got an address on David Goss, the
infected body that was left at Health Services.

163
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,953
- How recent?
- Two months.

164
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,716
OK, have LAPD send over a perimeter team.
Tell 'em hands off until Chase and I get there.

165
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,119
Got it.

166
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,714
Chase! Let's go. We're on.

167
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,230
- Get an address?
- Yeah.

168
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,793
Make sure they don't go in
until Jack gets there.

169
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,518
Hey.

170
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,034
- Peter just told me you got an address.
- Yeah.

171
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,032
- I'm bringing it over now.
- There's nothing more recent?

172
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,112
We could look for another hour
and not find anything better.

173
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,671
We don't have an hour to waste, do we?
Put transmitters on Jack and Chase.

174
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,150
I wanna analyse their interactions
so we can work it up in real time.

175
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,912
OK.

176
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,590
- Jack.
- What have you got?

177
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,070
Here's the address
where Goss was arrested for dealing.

178
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:54,152
- How recent?
- Two months ago. It's all in the file.

179
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,231
Good.

180
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,759
Medical kit.
Health Services had us put it together.

181
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,308
Thanks, baby.

182
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,709
Be careful.

183
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,791
Let's go, Chase!

184
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,039
We'll have to wait till we get there
to see the setup.

185
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,759
LAPD is locking it down now.

186
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:24,994
I know Kim told you about us. I was gonna
tell you, I just couldn't find the right time.

187
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:29,232
We thought you should know.
It's getting serious.

188
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,436
That's what she said.

189
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,512
- And what did CTU have to say?
- That it could be a very dangerous situation.

190
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,515
Almeida sent me a breakdown of what could
happen if this virus is released. It's not good.

191
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,910
Give CTU carte blanche.
Whatever they need, make sure they get it.

192
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,389
- I did.
- We should cancel the debate.

193
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,472
- What?
- It's a mistake to continue prepping

194
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:12,477
- while there's an imminent bioterrorist threat.
- We don't know that it's imminent, David.

195
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,711
And you know just as well as I do
that we get threats every day.

196
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:20,271
Not like this one. They said the body
was infected with a weaponized virus.

197
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,510
OK, let's say you're right.

198
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:28,755
What do you really think you could do
if you put your full attention on it?

199
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:33,789
I want to make sure you're not advising me
out of fear my image will suffer if we cancel.

200
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:36,030
<i>Oh, no, it will suffer.</i>

201
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:39,999
But I still think the best thing to do
is to proceed as planned

202
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:44,119
and respond when we have more information.

203
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,838
Keeler's here.

204
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:55,750
- Come on. Let's go in this way.
- Don't worry, Wayne.

205
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:59,557
- John.
- Mr President.

206
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:03,110
- You didn't have to come to welcome me.
- It's no trouble.

207
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,351
<i> I spoke with
your friend Jacob Weiss yesterday.</i>

208
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,079
<i>-  You stopped in South Dakota?
- Just for dinner.</i>

209
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:13,597
- How's he feeling?
- Better. He's playing a few rounds of golf.

210
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,478
That's him.
Well, I don't want to keep you, John.

211
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,109
You have last-minute cramming to do
if you want to survive this debate.

212
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:25,797
I won't argue with you there. Your
research staff outnumbers mine three to one.

213
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:28,110
I have to do
some of the shoe leather myself.

214
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,191
Touché.

215
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:33,556
- I'll see you inside, sir.
- You certainly will.

216
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,514
<i>-  No one, I mean no one, hears...
-  Wayne.</i>

217
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,068
We're ready.

218
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,038
I'll give you a call, all right?

219
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,431
What were you talking to him about?

220
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,795
I think we may have an opportunity.

221
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,996
What kind of opportunity?

222
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,548
Not now. After.

223
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,873
I'm sorry if you think
I'm not good enough for your daughter.

224
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,758
But I can't help the way I feel.

225
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:20,231
Chase, why do you think I put Kim at CTU?
Behind a desk, working at a computer?

226
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:25,997
So I can keep an eye on her. Make sure she's
safe. Not so she can date some field agent.

227
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:29,516
Safe? You're talking about her like she's 12.
She's a grown woman.

228
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,989
Dammit, you've seen
what this job can do to you.

229
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,834
- It's ruined every relationship I've ever had.
- That's you, Jack.

230
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,512
No! No!

231
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,637
- It's the job.
- I don't think so.

232
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,190
You don't think so.
What the hell do you know?

233
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,999
My wife died because of this job.

234
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:50,516
And I almost lost Kim, too.
I'm not gonna let that happen again.

235
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:55,913
I will do everything I have to protect her,
do you understand me? Everything.

236
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:02,679
Dammit, Chase. You cannot have
a normal life and do this job at the same time.

237
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,832
You're saying I shouldn't
have a relationship with anyone?

238
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,559
That's exactly what I'm saying.

239
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,560
And especially with my daughter.

240
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,189
This is Bauer.

241
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,236
<i>- Jack, it's Luis.
- What's up?</i>

242
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:26,475
I tried to move Salazar to solitary. There was
a lock on it from Division. What's that about?

243
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:31,429
- I can't tell you right now.
- He murdered his attorney right in front of us.

244
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,080
<i>What the hell is Division doing
protecting him?</i>

245
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,799
- They're not protecting him.
- Then what?

246
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,519
- I can't get into it right now.
- Can't go into it?

247
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,558
You're not the only one who gave up
his life to put this guy away.

248
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,835
I need to be in the loop, Jack.

249
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,750
<i>Jack?</i>

250
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,718
This doesn't go anywhere
after you hang up the phone.

251
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,472
<i>What?</i>

252
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:54,552
- Salazar might walk.
- Walk? What're you talking about?

253
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:59,031
I don't think it's gonna get to that. Someone
on the outside's got a lot of leverage.

254
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,633
Who?

255
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,712
<i>I think it's his brother Hector.</i>

256
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,030
<i>- I don't believe this.
- Just hang tight.</i>

257
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:10,477
<i>- I'll get back to you as soon as I can.
- Yeah, all right.</i>

258
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,954
You better start thinking about
what we're going to do when we get there.

259
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,508
- We'll talk about this later.
- Fine.

260
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,194
Open the door. Let's go.

261
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:38,752
<i>- Open 12.
-  Opening 12.</i>

262
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,675
Step forward. Let's go.

263
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,957
<i>Luis, ¿ya has encontrado nuevo abogado?</i>

264
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,992
No, I haven't found you a new lawyer.

265
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:04,950
- How about an execution date?
- Someone's not happy.

266
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,512
- What do you know, Ramón?
- About?

267
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,990
- Talk to me.
- Talk to you about what?

268
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,389
What is your brother trying to do?

269
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,199
Hector?
Have you heard from him? How is he?

270
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:34,229
His birthday's coming up next week.
I don't even know what to get him.

271
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:38,598
You keep talking trash, man,
you're not going anywhere.

272
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,439
Maybe not.
But let me assure you of one thing.

273
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:49,150
If something does happen,
and I am unexpectedly allowed to go free,

274
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:52,471
I have no doubt
that you'll come looking for me.

275
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:57,359
Especially after the death of your wife Elyse.

276
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,513
And your two boys. What are their names?
Tomás and Luis Jr?

277
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:20,639
- There's no follow-up call from the terrorists?
- No.

278
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,995
So there's nothing to report to the president?

279
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:26,709
Not till I hear from Bauer.
He's following up on the Goss lead right now.

280
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,950
All right, Tony. Thanks.

281
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:33,793
So, if you'll excuse me,
until this evening's debate. Thank you.

282
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:37,395
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much
for all of your questions.

283
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:40,040
- That went well.
- Yes, it did.

284
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,839
- So what's the latest?
- Nothing yet.

285
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:46,117
CTU's trying to figure out
who dropped off the dead body.

286
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,111
We still don't know who's behind this?

287
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,272
They're still speculating
that it's Salazar's brother.

288
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:55,478
What they don't know is if it's a bluff
staged to release Salazar.

289
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:59,348
How can it be a bluff?
The virus has been confirmed.

290
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:04,389
Yes, but dropping off a dead body is one
thing. Being able to infect an entire city,

291
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,471
that's something different.

292
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:09,358
All right.
I guess we'll know soon enough.

293
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,194
OK.

294
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,952
Hey, Wayne.

295
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:17,748
- You spoke earlier about an opportunity.
- Yeah.

296
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,469
Yeah, I'm not really sure that's something
we need to discuss right now.

297
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:24,996
Which means whatever it is fell through.

298
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,913
Or I won't like it,
so you're proceeding without me.

299
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,276
No, that's not it.
I just think that, because of this threat,

300
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:35,035
I don't want to divert your attention.

301
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,476
I can walk and chew gum at the same time.
What is it?

302
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:46,593
Keeler's playbook.
What if I can get us a copy?

303
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:51,515
- What exactly do you mean by playbook?
- His entire prep for tonight's debate.

304
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,434
How he's gonna answer the questions, what
issues he's gonna try and trip you up on.

305
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,238
Everything.

306
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,830
- And how would we get it?
- You don't need to know the details.

307
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:13,319
- I'm surprised.
- About what?

308
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:18,030
The question. You know there's no way
on earth that I would ever agree to this.

309
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,156
David, I'm not...

310
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,835
I am not talking about
pulling a Sherry and stealing it.

311
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:28,789
It may just drop in our laps
and, if it does, why shouldn't we look at it?

312
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:33,476
Wayne.
You are not in the private sector any more.

313
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:36,438
You have to get used to
how my administration works.

314
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:41,594
I am just trying
to give your administration four more years.

315
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:49,552
OK. OK, if that's how you want it.

316
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,995
That's how I want it.

317
00:23:54,400 --> 00:24:00,157
<i> All right, we're just about to start.
Can you all please take your seats here?</i>

318
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,950
- Kim. Are you all caught up?
- Pretty much.

319
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,679
I just have to refresh the data
on my dad's panel.

320
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,637
Great.

321
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:16,870
Can I ask you a question
about you and Tony?

322
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,155
Me and Tony what?

323
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:23,597
I don't know, I was just wondering.
Is it... a problem?

324
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:26,797
Working with your husband
in the same office?

325
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,429
No. No, it's not a problem. Why do you ask?

326
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:33,876
- It's not a big deal.
- No, it's OK, we have a minute.

327
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,393
Well, I, um...

328
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:40,190
been dating Chase
and I don't think my dad's too happy about it.

329
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:43,238
I see. Well, um...

330
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:47,393
I'm sure your dad's just trying to protect you.
But, ultimately,

331
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:50,153
it's just between you and Chase.

332
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,595
Yeah, I know.

333
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:56,798
- Let me know when you finish those panels.
- Sure.

334
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,308
Hey.

335
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,359
Analysis just called. If Hector Salazar's
orchestrated this biothreat,

336
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:12,274
he's probably operating out of Northern
Mexico. We need a list of his properties.

337
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:15,796
Chloe's going through the files
Jack turned in after the bust.

338
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:18,678
All right. I'll talk to her.

339
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:23,709
Fire up all our contacts there in case Hector
has shown his face in the last couple of days.

340
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,313
OK.

341
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,999
- Is the boy still in place?
- Yeah.

342
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,275
And the president's been informed?

343
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,669
Yeah, and he's not cancelling the debate.

344
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:41,877
<i>He's got some cojones, I'll give him that.</i>

345
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:46,590
Let's see what kind of tough guy he is when
there's a couple of million lives on the line.

346
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:50,639
<i>Sólo quiero lo mejor para ti
y no quiero preocuparme.</i>

347
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,190
<i>Papá, no tengo miedo.
Sé lo que estoy haciendo.</i>

348
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,474
<i>No sabes, hija.</i>

349
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:59,553
<i>Soy suficiente grande
para hacer mis propias decisiones.</i>

350
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,358
Claudia!

351
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,112
- What's going on?
- Nothing. Everything's fine.

352
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,475
Don't tell me nothing.

353
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:15,588
- Why you argue with your father?
- Please, Hector. It doesn't matter.

354
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,272
He's not happy with how I live my life.

355
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,910
He doesn't like you being with me?

356
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,998
<i>- ¡Oriol!
- Sí, señor.</i>

357
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:46,599
Don't raise your voice
to your father ever again.

358
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,155
<i>Claudia, no!</i>

359
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:54,989
How I conduct myself with my father
is my concern. Not yours.

360
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,953
Good. Now that's settled.

361
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,317
Tell Lucía to prepare supper. OK?

362
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,751
We eat early tonight.

363
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,912
OK, I'll tell him.

364
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,789
- Almeida.
- I just got off the phone with Jack.

365
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,030
<i>- They just arrived.
- Is there a problem?</i>

366
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,509
- Jack won't use the transmitters.
- Why not?

367
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,909
He says it would take too long
to wire them up.

368
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:55,155
Whatever. Look, any information he digs up,
I want it right away. You got it?

369
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:58,036
OK. You don't have to yell.

370
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:01,908
No one's yelling, Chloe. We got
a body infected with a deadly virus.

371
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,798
We have to tie it to Salazar
in the next three hours.

372
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:09,396
Right now, Jack's location is our only lead.
So I need you to keep me up to the minute.

373
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,311
- Understood?
- I said OK.

374
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:14,278
<i>Good. Then get on it.</i>

375
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,831
- Detective Fisher?
- Yeah. You Bauer?

376
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:25,718
This is my partner Chase Edmunds.
What's the activity?

377
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,951
- No one's gone in or out since we got here.
- What's the layout?

378
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,315
Probably 30 people.
Spread out on all floors.

379
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:34,836
The apartment you asked us to case
is the corner one, third floor.

380
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,718
- You didn't go in?
- Orders were to wait till you got here.

381
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,678
- Good.
- How much backup you want?

382
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:44,719
- None. I want your men to cover the exits.
- There's 30 scumbags in there.

383
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:48,315
We don't want to set off any alarms.
We can sneak in without a fight.

384
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,072
<i>- Sure about that?
-  Yeah.</i>

385
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:53,596
Keep this on channel one.
We'll tell you when we want you to come in.

386
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,875
- Let's go.
- You got it.

387
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,598
- This area's not open to the public.
- Take it easy, sport.

388
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:54,877
- We just want a little information.
- Beat it.

389
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,910
- Zach, cops!
- Go, Chase!

390
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,278
Get back!

391
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,239
Cover me.

392
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,112
<i> Reloading!</i>

393
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,834
Chase, we got a runner!

394
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:24,710
- Don't even think about it!
- I'm clean! You've got nothing on me!

395
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:28,395
Shut up, stupid.
You just fired at a federal agent.

396
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:32,268
You better start talking to me.
Or I will let you bleed to death here.

397
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:36,797
- Chase! I got him. We're down here.
- Fisher, we're good. We got our suspect.

398
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:40,793
- Who is David Goss?
- He's a dealer. I score from him sometimes.

399
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,633
- Not any more. He's dead.
- OK. He's dead.

400
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:48,515
Don't be a smartass. Who was his supplier?

401
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:51,797
Who was his supplier?

402
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,277
Chase.

403
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:02,194
A guy named Carlos Corretja.
He works outta Tijuana.

404
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:05,317
Corretja was one of
Salazar's mid-level distributors.

405
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:08,312
- You doing business with him?
- I'm calling him tonight.

406
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:12,154
Corretja wanted me to find a mule.
Someone clean, without a record.

407
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,198
- What for?
- To move a bag of coke across the border.

408
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:18,078
- It didn't make any sense to me.
- Why not?

409
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,991
He paid ten grand to bring it up.

410
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:23,436
- Coke isn't even worth that much.
- Where's the bag of coke now?

411
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,750
The guy who brought it across still has it.

412
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,752
- What's his name?
- His name is Kyle. Kyle Singer.

413
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:33,480
<i> Sorry, Helen...</i>

414
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:40,199
- What is... what is this?
- It's the final notice.

415
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,510
If you don't pay the rent by tomorrow, 8am,

416
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:45,990
I'm calling City Services
and they start the eviction process.

417
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:50,278
<i> Don, don't do this. Please.
I'm gonna have it in a couple of days.</i>

418
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,351
<i> I can't carry you...</i>

419
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:06,954
I'll be back.

420
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,714
- Kyle.
- How much do you owe him, Ma?

421
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,791
- Stay out of this.
- How much?

422
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:21,238
$1800. And don't you worry about it, because
your father is gonna talk to Uncle Sandford.

423
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,715
Hey, 1800, right?

424
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,390
Here.

425
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:46,753
From now on if you have a problem,
talk to me or my dad. OK?

426
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,950
Leave my mom out of it.

427
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:52,315
I expect a receipt in the mailbox.

428
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:08,515
- Where did you get that money?
- It doesn't matter. We needed it, I got it.

429
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:14,632
Can I have everybody's attention, please?

430
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:16,995
Everyone should work up
the name Kyle Singer.

431
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:20,789
I want point sheets from department heads
on my desk in five minutes.

432
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:23,030
Everything about Kyle Singer, I want it.

433
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:27,079
Where he lives, works and, most importantly,
where he's likely to be now.

434
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:31,358
Keep an open channel to Field Ops so Chloe
can forward anything that comes in to Jack.

435
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,873
Let's go.

436
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:46,038
- What are you doing?
- Narrowing the search space.

437
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:51,754
I can't believe you're this stupid, Kyle.

438
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:54,991
This is how you're gonna help your family?
By dealing drugs?

439
00:34:55,080 --> 00:35:00,279
I'm not dealing 'em. It's a stupid delivery. It's
quick money which my folks need right now.

440
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:05,115
Where are they gonna get
the money to bail you out of jail, Kyle?

441
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,631
You're right.

442
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:16,028
It was stupid. I know that.

443
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:20,274
But I did it. I'm in this now.

444
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:23,079
I'm in the middle of this.

445
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:26,952
Look, I'm gonna make
this delivery tonight, all right?

446
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,429
And I promise it's gonna be over.
I promise you.

447
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:32,557
I'm not waiting until tonight. It's over now.

448
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,433
What you talkin' about?

449
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:41,237
I can't be with someone
who does stuff like this.

450
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,195
I'm sorry, Kyle.

451
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,116
Hold on. Linda!

452
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,679
- Come on, Linda, please!
- It's over, Kyle.

453
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,719
Are you gonna tell me what's going on?

454
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:01,476
- Look... we just had a disagreement.
- Where did you get the money to pay Don?

455
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:04,791
- Mom, forget about it, please.
- What's your dad gonna say?

456
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:08,873
He's not gonna take
"forget about it" as an answer.

457
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,879
I don't know.

458
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,715
- Would you excuse us, please?
- David.

459
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:29,119
- Sorry, Anne. Our schedule's been way off.
- I thought you couldn't join me.

460
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:34,274
I can't. I only have a couple of minutes.
I'm having your security level upgraded.

461
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,871
- I'm gonna need your advice today.
- What's going on?

462
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:42,431
What do you know
about type III pneumonic viruses?

463
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:46,399
Not a lot, they're fairly new.
As far as I know, there are several strains.

464
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:49,552
Most of them are fast-acting
and all are deadly.

465
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:53,519
- Someone's threatening to release a virus.
- Oh, God.

466
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:57,149
I need you to talk to a Dr Sunny Macer
at National Health Services.

467
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:59,708
Yeah, I know Sunny. But, David,

468
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:03,634
if you think there's a remote possibility
that this thing is for real,

469
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,790
you need to get outta Los Angeles.

470
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:09,031
That's not possible.
The debate is in little over two hours.

471
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:12,032
You're talking about an outbreak
here in the city.

472
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:15,829
This isn't something
the Secret Service can protect you against.

473
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:21,392
I know. I know. And we are prepared
to leave if the situation warrants it.

474
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:27,316
But right now, I need you to talk to Dr Macer
and learn everything you can about this thing.

475
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:31,029
- I will.
- It's OK. It's all right.

476
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,871
Yes.

477
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:45,318
- Your brother would like to see you, sir.
- Send him in.

478
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:48,437
He's downstairs.
He requests that you come see him.

479
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:51,990
- Come see him?
- Yes, sir. He has something to show you.

480
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:55,637
You go ahead. I'm gonna call Sunny.

481
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:58,154
See you later.

482
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,230
<i> No, I'm gonna check that out myself.</i>

483
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:08,075
Chase is bringing the suspect into CTU. I
want you to set up a white room for him now.

484
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,435
- Take Parker to CTU.
- What about Singer?

485
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:12,988
I'll take care of Singer.
You take care of Parker.

486
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:15,833
Anybody can take him to CTU.
I'm going with you.

487
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,957
- No, you're not.
- Why are you trying to get rid of me?

488
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:22,919
I'm not. I think Parker's got more information.
I want you to get it out of him.

489
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,595
Is it about Kim? Are you punishing me
for dating your daughter?

490
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:31,071
If that kid's got a bag of cocaine that's
got the virus in it and he doesn't know it,

491
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:35,517
- I need to stop him putting it into circulation.
- I know. That's why I wanna help you.

492
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:38,353
- You can't. It's too dangerous.
- Too dangerous?

493
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,908
You can't have it both ways, Chase.

494
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:45,198
My daughter loves you. You wanna be with
her, I have to stop putting you in danger.

495
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,192
You're kidding, right?

496
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,999
Take Parker to CTU. That's an order.

497
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:09,155
<i>- Yeah. Call you right back.
-  All right. Same number.</i>

498
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,675
Excuse us for a minute.

499
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,388
What is it, Wayne?

500
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:25,158
Don't be angry,
but I got a copy of Keeler's playbook.

501
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,754
- I told you to drop that.
- Will you listen to me?

502
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:32,197
If you don't want to use it, then don't.
But there is something you need to see.

503
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:34,874
There's nothing I need to see.

504
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,634
It's about Anne.

505
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:41,190
<i>Keeler's too smart
to play the race card or the girlfriend card.</i>

506
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:45,478
It's neither one of those,
which is why I'm bringing this to you.

507
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,676
It's something that we didn't know about her.

508
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,320
Something that, if true, could...

509
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,837
David, it could damage all of us.

510
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,388
Just take a look at it.

511
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,034
Yeah.

512
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,712
Give me an update.

513
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,598
- Kyle's still in his house.
- What about the package?

514
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,910
- It's with him.
- And Ramón?

515
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,912
- Just waiting to come home.
- Good.

516
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:23,509
- Gael. Chloe's been looking for you.
- Where is she?

517
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:26,239
- She's in IT.
- All right.
