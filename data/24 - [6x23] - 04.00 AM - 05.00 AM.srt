<i>Bill Buchanan had Fayed in custody
and he let him go.</i>

00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:23,110
<i>Karen Hayes put it in a blue file
over at Homeland.</i>

3
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,749
Someone will have to go down.
The farther from the president, the better.

4
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,674
- Are you asking me to resign?
- I have to fire you.

5
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,671
We're talking about the end of my career.

6
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:35,638
<i>An FB-sub-circuit board
from one of the weapons</i>

00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:39,918
<i>is now in the possession
of an agent of the Chinese government.</i>

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,436
<i>If the Chinese agent
in possession of the sub-circuit board</i>

9
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,556
<i>transfers it to his government,</i>

10
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:49,519
<i>the entire Russian defence system
will be compromised.</i>

11
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,513
<i>I will have no choice but to extend
my country's forward perimeter.</i>

12
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,229
You are talking about attacking
one of our military bases.

13
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,548
<i>You have two hours.</i>

14
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,273
Everyone on the floor!

15
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,909
My men have your grandson.
Have you repaired the sub-circuit board?

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,991
I'll return it when you bring my grandson.

17
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,152
Cheng, I'm sending the boy to you now.

18
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,636
Hello, Josh.
Your grandfather wants to speak with you.

19
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,359
- What do you want?
- I am going to give you the future

20
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:22,797
I promised you when you were born. I'm
taking you away from this ungrateful country.

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,991
Cheng, it's over!

22
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,833
Tell me where the boy is and I won't kill you.

23
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:36,989
Help!

24
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,435
Josh!

25
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,948
<i>- I lost the boy.
- Who has him?</i>

26
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:50,079
- CTU and your son.
- This is totally unacceptable.

27
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:54,153
The boy was my price for repairing
the circuit board. Our arrangement is over.

28
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,232
I've got Phillip Bauer
calling for you on a scrambled line.

29
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:01,598
I want my grandson. And I want clear passage
to the country of my choice.

30
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,559
If you give me that, then I'll give you
the FB-sub-circuit board.

31
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,473
- You're working with the Chinese.
- I was.

32
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,759
- Is Phillip Bauer someone we can trust?
- We have no choice. Get me CTU.

33
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,874
- You need to come with me.
- What do you mean?

34
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,756
Come now!

35
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,796
- Agent Doyle!
- Orders, Jack!

36
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:23,316
- The boy stays with me!
- Uncle Jack!

37
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,595
Josh!

38
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,269
- Where are you taking me?
- I'm sorry, Josh.

39
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,996
You're sorry for what? What's going on?

40
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,313
This has to do with my grandpa.

41
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,188
Josh, he's got something we need,
something that will stop a war,

42
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,955
so we have to go through the motions
of handing you over to him.

43
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,508
What, you mean
you're not actually gonna do it?

44
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,956
As soon as we get what we need from him,
we're gonna recover you.

45
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,749
We have two TAC teams and LAPD
at the rendezvous site.

46
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,870
This is a locating device, Josh.

47
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:33,034
We're gonna be able to track you until we get
the green light on your recovery operation.

48
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,718
Look, I understand you're scared -

49
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,711
I would be too -

50
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,189
but I will get you back, Josh.

51
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,119
- This may sting a little.
- Argh!

52
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,991
Look, we're making a mistake.
You can't let them do this.

53
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,992
You can talk to Doyle.
You can't let them hand Josh over.

54
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,719
Those orders come from the White House.
Get in.

55
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,030
- Are you arresting me, charging me?
- No.

56
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,715
We have orders to place you in custody
to protect our operation.

57
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,837
Don't make this harder than it is.

58
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,791
<i>(dials phone)</i>

59
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,749
<i>(phone rings)</i>

60
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,637
- O'Brian.
- Chloe, it's Jack.

61
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,952
- Jack, Nadia said you were in custody.
- Why is CTU handing Josh to my father?

62
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,838
It's a trade-off.
The order came from the vice president.

63
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,798
Your father got ahold of
the FB-sub-circuit board.

64
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,111
He's offering it in exchange
for Josh and a safe passage.

65
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,510
Whatever he said,
he has no intention of giving up that board.

66
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,957
The White House feels they have no
alternative. Doyle has a plan to get Josh back.

67
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,556
My father will have a better plan.
Dammit, Chloe, we need to stop this.

68
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06,712
<i>- Put me through to Karen Hayes.
- Hold on.</i>

69
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:12,557
My earlier deception... was a desperate move
on my part, Mr President.

70
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:17,760
It was a mistake which I'm sure
compromised... your trust in me,

71
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,592
and for that I'm deeply sorry.

72
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,070
But you are not calling
simply to offer your apology.

73
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:29,235
Sir, I'm aware that your generals
are pushing you toward a military response,

74
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:32,596
but an opportunity has presented itself
that may allow us both

75
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,797
to avoid a war that neither of us wants.

76
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,075
- I'm listening.
- The man with the component

77
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,912
no longer works with the Chinese.

78
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,313
He's offered to trade it back to us and...
I've authorised the exchange.

79
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:49,075
For the sake of both our countries,
I hope it happens soon,

80
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,276
because until you have the component

81
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,955
I have no choice
but to continue on our present path.

82
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:59,079
The chatter we are picking up from
Chinese intelligence is not encouraging,

83
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,276
and they are far from incompetent.

84
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:07,071
I cannot extend or rescind this deadline
for anything other than concrete results.

85
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,230
<i>I understand your position.</i>

86
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:14,838
The purpose of this call is to keep you current
on our efforts to try to avoid a conflict.

87
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,516
<i>- Karen Hayes.
- This is Bauer.</i>

88
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,319
Do you know of the plan
to hand my nephew to my father?

89
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,039
- I do.
- Karen, you cannot let this happen.

90
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,873
It is a mistake to trust him.
You will get nothing back.

91
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,509
- He's gonna keep Josh and the board.
- Why would he need the board?

92
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:34,593
Because it's his leverage with the Chinese.
He's useless to them without it.

93
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,399
Whatever you offered,
the Chinese are offering more.

94
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:42,474
Karen, my father is smart enough
to manipulate this exchange.

95
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,949
I don't think we should go through with this,

96
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:49,079
but the vice president feels
it's the only way to avoid war.

97
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:52,391
He's given his order.
I don't have the authority to do anything.

98
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,550
You're gonna have to take care of this.

99
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:57,438
I can't. CTU has put me in temporary custody

100
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,193
to stop me from interfering
with their operation.

101
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:03,590
Karen, he is an innocent boy.

102
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,559
You need to stop this
and you need to stop it now.

103
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,915
Well, that did not go well - not that
I expected much goodwill from Suvarov.

104
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,754
- I just got off the phone with Jack Bauer.
- I thought he was under arrest.

105
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,912
- He is, but he called me.
- OK, he called you.

106
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,518
<i>Yes, and he's convinced that his father
will try to get the boy and the circuit board.</i>

107
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:39,270
How? We can verify the authenticity
of the board before we hand over Josh.

108
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,477
- Do you think Jack's concerns are warranted?
- Absolutely.

109
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,711
He's Phillip Bauer's son.
He's been more right than we have.

110
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,873
Well, point taken there.
All right, let's say we refuse to give up Josh,

111
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:53,953
which is the only thing Phillip Bauer
seems to want, how do we get the board?

112
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,679
Well, if you don't have any ideas,
I think I might.

113
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,035
If it involves keeping Daniels in the dark...

114
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,032
Tom, he won't listen to me, but if you...

115
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:05,476
My relationship
with the vice president is complicated at best.

116
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,313
I can't be seen making an end run around him.

117
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,791
But I promise I won't be
looking your way if you do.

118
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,991
<i>(phone rings)</i>

That's personal. Nothing you need in there.

Mr Buchanan,
our subpoena covers everything. Sorry.

It's a family album, for crying out loud.

You haven't been charged with any
crimes yet, but that could change.

Look, I know you don't wanna talk to me,
but... I really need your help.

128
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,154
I don't know where else to turn.

129
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,111
What do you mean? Are you OK?

No, I'm fine. I just... I really need your help.

- What do you need from me, Karen?

133
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,232
I just got off the phone with Jack.

134
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,788
- He's being held in custody by CTU.
- Why?

135
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,997
Because they don't want him
to interfere with an operation.

136
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,149
What operation?

137
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,915
<i>- Phillip Bauer has the component.
- What?</i>

138
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,231
He claims he'll trade the sub-circuit board
for his grandson,

139
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,278
but Jack thinks it's a setup,
that Phillip will get the boy,

140
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:53,318
keep the component,
and make a deal with the Chinese.

141
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,392
- And I completely agree.
- Have you spoken to Nadia Yassir?

142
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:01,474
Oh, she won't budge on this thing. She's
under direct orders from the vice president.

143
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:08,994
What are you asking me to do, Karen?

144
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,674
Whatever it takes to stop the exchange.

145
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:34,757
Nadia, we just touched down at the
meeting point. I'm not seeing any activity.

146
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,751
Surveillance confirms that.

147
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,957
- How's the signal on Josh's tracker?
- Coming in clear.

148
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:45,592
The tracker signal's strong.
You wait here. I'm gonna check it out.

149
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,315
Come on.

150
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,751
<i>(phone rings)</i>

151
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,988
CTU, I've got a call coming in. It could be him.

152
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,476
- Can you trace the call?
- We're patched into Doyle's phone,

153
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,120
so we'll be able to listen to the conversation.

154
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,158
- All right, Mike, go ahead, answer it.
- This is Doyle.

155
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,199
Before we do anything,
I want CTU to turn off the satellite feed.

156
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,230
What are you talking about?

157
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,634
I have an uplink.

158
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,759
I know when they're watching,
and I know when they're off line.

159
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,717
Stand by.

160
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,514
Nadia, can we tell if he's bluffing?

161
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,079
He's not bluffing.
He's absolutely in our system.

162
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,993
- How?
- I don't know.

163
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,395
Mike, Phillip Bauer
has tapped into our satellite surveillance.

164
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:17,508
- Can he see Josh's tracker signal?
- No, that's on an internal network.

165
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,639
All right, go off line. Tell the LAPD
and the TAC teams to keep a wide perimeter

166
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,917
outside the satellite area.
We can't afford to spook him.

167
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,791
Morris, shut down the satellite.
Marcy, let LAPD and our teams know.

168
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,316
- It's done.
- Mike, satellite is off line.

169
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:39,153
- Mr Bauer, CTU satellite is off line.
- I can see that.

170
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,392
Now get rid of the chopper.

171
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:47,509
Aerial One, return to base. That's an order.

172
00:12:55,560 --> 00:13:00,111
<i>- Now how do you wanna work the exchange?
- Wait there. Someone will come.</i>

173
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,317
- When?
- Whenever I'm damn well ready.

174
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,472
Put my grandson on the phone.

175
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:13,317
Your grandfather wants to speak with you.
But don't fight him, Josh. OK?

176
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:19,077
The easier he thinks this is gonna go,
the less on guard he's gonna be.

177
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,154
- Yeah.
- Hello, Joshua.

178
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,595
Have you thought
about what we talked about?

179
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:33,310
Yes, and I don't wanna go anywhere with you.
I hate you.

180
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:39,315
Joshua, listen to me.
I understand you're frightened and angry,

181
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:44,349
but your father's involvement in what
happened today will be public knowledge.

182
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,796
Staying in this country is not an option.
There's nothing here.

183
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:51,714
- My mom's here.
- Your mother can join you at any time,

184
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,439
but she is incapable
of giving you what you need.

185
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:58,718
Where we're going,
I will have the means and the power

186
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,554
to help you become the kind of man
your father should have been.

187
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,915
Now you think about that.

188
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,875
The boy's in position.
You can go get him now.

189
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,597
No sign of anyone so far.

190
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:44,198
We're trying to get coverage without Phillip
Bauer knowing, but he's covered all bases.

191
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,271
Yeah, that doesn't surprise me.

192
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:49,238
How do I know the component's real
once they hand it over?

193
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,150
Chloe?

194
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,152
The component
has an R-72 socket on its underside.

195
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:57,358
When you plug your PDA into that,
I'll be able to verify the circuitry from here.

196
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,635
Good.

197
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:07,318
Once I know the component's real,
if I see a chance to get the kid back, I'll take it.

198
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:11,712
No. I wanna see Josh safe too, but we're
under strict orders from the White House.

199
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,951
We're not authorised to retrieve him
until the board is at CTU.

200
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,749
- I'm not talking about authorisation.
- Well, I am.

201
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:23,595
Mike, there's too much at stake. You're
not going off book on this, understood?

202
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,672
<i>Mike, do you confirm?</i>

203
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:30,878
- Nadia, I have Karen Hayes on two.
- Put it through to my cellphone.

204
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,875
Mike, you're on comm
with Chloe and Morris.

205
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,869
Yeah, I'll keep 'em posted.

206
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:38,916
Yes.

207
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,232
The vice president would like to check
on the status of the trade with Phillip Bauer.

208
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:47,074
The agent is in position with the boy.
He's waiting to be contacted.

209
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,958
I did tell the White House
that I would report in.

210
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:53,635
Yes, I know, but I just wanted to make sure
that everyone's on board -

211
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:57,508
that no one has any doubts
that this is the right course of action.

212
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,875
The order is not being questioned.

213
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,916
What's the status of Jack Bauer?

214
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,673
He's being transferred to Detention at District.

215
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:09,515
Good, I need to be able to view the operation
on your internal deployment grid.

216
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:15,033
<i>- Do you mind me asking why?
- Yes, actually, I do.</i>

217
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,910
The vice president wants me to keep track
of Jack Bauer, so I need the security code.

218
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,870
Right away.

219
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:37,714
Log onto the grid on nine-four.
Security code Alpha-Charlie-November.

220
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,513
Got it. Thank you.

221
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:53,239
I got a call from security.
Head over to the lounge.

222
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:56,915
- Why? What's the problem?
- Marilyn Bauer.

223
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,840
I'm not a prisoner,
so stop treating me like one.

224
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,876
I wanna see my son. I wanna see him now!

225
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:15,431
And if you can't tell me where he is,
I will find somebody who can!

226
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,034
Get out of my way. Get out of my way!

227
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,918
Listen, Mrs Bauer,
if you'd calm down, we can talk...

228
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,470
- Did something happen? Did he get hurt?
- No. Josh is fine.

229
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:27,950
They wanna debrief him
while events are still fresh in his mind.

230
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:31,510
You have no right to talk to my son.
He needs to have a parent present.

231
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,875
- I wanna be with my son.
- I understand...

232
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,793
No! You have no idea what I'm going through.

233
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,758
And if you don't get me to him now,
I'm gonna get our lawyers

234
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,116
and I will take this whole place down,
including you!

235
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,350
Ma'am.

236
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,670
<i>- (phone rings)
- O'Brian.</i>

237
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:52,151
I need you to send additional security to the
lounge area to escort Mrs Bauer to Holding.

238
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,028
<i>I want my son! You can't keep me here!</i>

239
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,554
They're on their way.

240
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:03,236
Can I have two additional security to the
lounge to escort Marilyn Bauer to Holding?

241
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:06,198
Thank you.

242
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,549
What?

243
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,918
It doesn't bother you? What if we don't get
Josh back? Phillip Bauer is a murderer.

244
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,514
I don't like it, I hate it, but we have our orders.

245
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,718
- Since when do you care about orders?
- We're trying to avoid starting a war.

246
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,997
Speaking as someone
that placed a lot of people's lives at risk,

247
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,230
I can see why it's necessary, yes.

248
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:28,869
Jack thinks his father has no intention
of giving us the component.

249
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,794
I don't think we can count on Jack
being objective about his father right now.

250
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,075
Who cares, if he's right?

251
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:39,950
Are you angry at me as if I'm the one that
made the decision to go through with this?

252
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:45,239
No, I... It's just that Josh didn't do anything.
He's innocent.

253
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:55,996
Chloe, keep a close eye on Josh's tracker.
If that signal weakens, I wanna know.

254
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,878
I will.

255
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,239
- CTU, this is Doyle.
- You're on with O'Brian.

256
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:08,359
Helicopter approaching out of the north.
It's too far to read its markings.

257
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:12,115
- Do you think it might be Bauer?
- I don't know, that's why I'm asking you.

258
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:16,318
All right, no need to get testy.
Pulling up the FAA database now.

259
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:21,875
The coastguard has a patrol
west of your position. It's not Bauer.

260
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,712
- All right, thanks.
- Doyle?

261
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,951
- Yeah?
- A lot of people disagree with this operation.

262
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:32,239
I just want you to know that what
you're doing, I think, is absolutely necessary.

263
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:36,598
Morris, the next time I want your opinion,
I'll ask for it.

264
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,954
Fair enough.

265
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,833
<i>- (car horn blares)
- What's this lunatic doing?</i>

266
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,194
What the hell?

267
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:14,078
Don't move. Get your handcuffs out. Do it.

268
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,549
Mr Buchanan?

269
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,355
- What are you doing?
- Do you have Jack Bauer?

270
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,795
We have orders to transport him to Detention.

271
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,872
- I need you to release him.
- You've been relieved of duty.

272
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,235
I'm no threat to anyone. I'm not even armed.

273
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,436
- Stay where you are.
- You won't shoot me.

274
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:37,479
- Stop coming. You know what I'll have to do.
- You don't have to do anything.

275
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,516
You're a good man. I trained you.

276
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:44,151
I know you can't possibly believe
what's happening here is right.

277
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,677
You're following orders, but your
oath of allegiance is not to one single person.

278
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:51,069
You swore to uphold the Constitution.

279
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:54,755
The orders you're following are illegal.

280
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,957
You have an opportunity here, Turner.
Don't blow it.

281
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,952
Agent Turner, put the weapon down.

282
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,395
Put it down.

283
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:09,437
- Did they hand Josh over to my father?
- Doyle's in position, awaiting instructions.

284
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,988
OK.

285
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,991
Let's go.

286
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,398
- Did Karen explain everything to you?
- Yeah.

287
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,472
- Thank you for doing this.
- You don't have to thank me.

288
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,154
You put yourself on the line. I appreciate it.

289
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,755
Let's just hope you're right about your father.

290
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,070
Unfortunately, I am.

291
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,876
<i>(man) Sir, if you'll just wait here.</i>

292
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,913
Thank you. Oh, Stuart.

293
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:30,551
Morris, find out who that is.

294

Your brother died saving my life.

He saw that I was in danger,

What in the hell were you thinking?

366
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:15,430
I learned a hard lesson today, sir,
when I trusted Fayed.

367
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:20,310
- What lesson was that?
- Never negotiate with a sociopath.

368
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,436
Phillip Bauer is a sociopath.

369

We can't trust he'll give us the component,
whether we give him the boy or not.

Dammit, Karen, that is not your call to make!

371

I understand. I wouldn't have done what I did
if I wasn't willing to accept the consequences.

00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,513
Oh, believe me, there will be consequences.

go down hard for this.

00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:32,472
when none of the ultimate
responsibility lies with you, but...

447
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,914
sitting in this chair...

448
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:43,556
Until you sit in this chair,
you don't know anything. You can't know.

449
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:49,356
Sir... in lieu of the fact that Karen was right,

450
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:53,228
you might wanna reconsider
your punitive stance towards her.

451
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:56,756
My decision was wrong,
but I can't condone insubordination.

452
00:35:56,840 --> 00:36:00,549
Sir, you do not want the facts of your
disagreement with Karen made public,

453
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:04,030
and that's exactly what will happen
if you prosecute her.

454
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,190
And after this crisis has passed,

455
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:11,035
Karen Hayes and Bill Buchanan can retire
quietly to their country home in Vermont.

456
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:16,319
You will be honouring her service.
It's just a better outcome all around.

457
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,391
I'll consider your advice,

458
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:23,429
but right now I need a real-time update
on CTU's progress.

459
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,034
All right, sir.

460
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,551
<i>(sighs)</i>

461
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:40,075
It's Jack. The trauma team say
his injuries aren't life-threatening,

462
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:44,119
but he's gonna be blind in one,
if not both, eyes.

463
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,192
- I should've listened.
- You did what you thought was right.

464
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,669
- Is satellite back up yet?
- Any minute.

465
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:53,593
But it'll be next to impossible
to find a craft that size.

466
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:58,959
Their boat had limited range.
They must be meeting up with a larger vessel.

467
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,839
<i>(Nadia) Jack?</i>

468
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,717
Get me the names and locations

469
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,270
of every offshore oil platform
within a ten-mile radius.

470
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,634
Why?

471
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:13,076
My father's company, BXJ,
has shelter corporations.

472
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:17,551
They own oil leases up and down the coast.
He didn't pick this location at random.

473
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:21,838
- I'm on it.
- I'll let you know what we find. Thanks.

474
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,588
- Are you still in the clear?
- Yes, sir.

475
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,352
Good.

476
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:47,432
Dock on the northeast side of the platform.

477
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,158
Copy that.

478
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:56,114
- They'll bring the boy here?
- Yeah.

479
00:37:56,200 --> 00:38:01,274
- When do I get my component?
- You get it when they deliver the boy.

480
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:05,592
Good. You're making the right choice
continuing to work with us.

481
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:10,519
Your mistakes
have been totally unacceptable...

482
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,548
but China is still my future.

483
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:09,949
Morris, no luck tracing the oil leases
through the CNC servers.

484
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:14,511
Check the EPA database. Coastal leases
have to have regulatory approval.

485
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:17,309
Good idea. Nadia will call in an access code.

486
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,516
- All right.
- Nadia...

487
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:23,876
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

488
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,479
Chloe. Chloe.

489
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,630
Chloe, darling? Are you all right?

490
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:32,828
Can someone please help me?
Darling? Darling? Can you hear me?

491
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:35,070
Can someone please help me?!

492
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:16,556
