1
00:00:14,432 --> 00:00:18,392
I'm on the phone with a man who claims
to be James Nathanson, Cummings' contact.

2
00:00:18,472 --> 00:00:21,465
He says he has information,
but he will only talk to you.

3
00:00:21,553 --> 00:00:25,263
- What do you want with me?
- The terrorists are trying to kill me.

4
00:00:25,354 --> 00:00:27,311
What makes you think I won't kill you?

5
00:00:27,394 --> 00:00:31,388
Because you want to stop the Sentox gas
being released on American soil. So do I.

6
00:00:31,475 --> 00:00:33,830
Nathanson, stay down!

7
00:00:33,916 --> 00:00:35,508
Stay down!

8
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:41,670
What's on the chip?
Please! What's on the chip?

9
00:00:42,077 --> 00:00:43,510
O'Brian.

10
00:00:43,597 --> 00:00:45,987
I have a ThumbDrive
that will help find the Sentox.

11
00:00:46,078 --> 00:00:49,309
The decryption kicked out
a company called Omicron.

12
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:52,709
Pull up their roster.
See if Christopher Henderson is on the list.

13
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:55,553
Senior vice president
of research and development.

14
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:58,951
- Send me the decrypted files over to my PDA.
- That's gonna be hard to do.

15
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,680
You're up to something. I won't stand for it.

16
00:01:01,761 --> 00:01:04,833
- This was an attempt to circumvent me.
- We are on the same side.

17
00:01:04,922 --> 00:01:08,551
If your father wasn't secretary of defense,
I'd have you thrown out.

18
00:01:08,642 --> 00:01:10,474
I don't have that problem with you.

19
00:01:10,562 --> 00:01:15,239
I spent a year securing a weapon
that would bring Moscow to its knees

20
00:01:15,324 --> 00:01:17,076
and you waste it.

21
00:01:17,163 --> 00:01:19,838
We were betrayed, Bierko.
Someone must pay.

22
00:01:19,924 --> 00:01:22,280
I agree.

23
00:01:23,845 --> 00:01:26,040
This is President Logan. What is it you want?

24
00:01:26,125 --> 00:01:29,277
I want the route of Suvarov's motorcade.

25
00:01:29,366 --> 00:01:34,121
If you refuse to cooperate, I will have
no choice but to release all the Sentox gas.

26
00:01:34,207 --> 00:01:37,324
- He wants to assassinate Suvarov.
- Don't negotiate with them.

27
00:01:37,408 --> 00:01:39,603
Isn't that the point of the treaty you signed?

28
00:01:40,008 --> 00:01:42,522
Mr. President,
I'm glad we have this opportunity

29
00:01:42,609 --> 00:01:45,885
to thank you and Mrs. Logan
for your hospitality.

30
00:01:45,969 --> 00:01:49,007
The motorcade will take
service roads to the 118.

31
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:52,685
- Mrs. Logan.
- Aaron. I've decided to drive to the airport.

32
00:01:52,771 --> 00:01:55,331
- I'll ride up front.
- No, that's not necessary.

33
00:01:55,411 --> 00:01:56,400
Yes, it is.

34
00:01:56,492 --> 00:02:01,885
<i>The world has become, quote,
"safer and more secure from terrorist attack".</i>

35
00:02:08,893 --> 00:02:14,572
<i>President Suvarov and his wife
will be flying back to Moscow in a few hours.</i>

36
00:02:18,056 --> 00:02:19,648
- Yes.
- Where is the motorcade?

37
00:02:19,735 --> 00:02:23,093
- Getting on the 118.
- How long till they reach the ambush point?

38
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:27,056
- About 40 minutes.
- Good. We'll be waiting.

39
00:02:29,538 --> 00:02:32,178
Get everything ready.

40
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,934
Mr. President, I asked Secret Service

41
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:45,569
to send their threat assessment
for President Suvarov's route.

42
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:49,051
The most vulnerable point is here
at the downtown corridor.

43
00:02:49,141 --> 00:02:52,532
This is the most likely point of attack

44
00:02:52,622 --> 00:02:54,772
if an ambush were to occur.

45
00:02:54,862 --> 00:02:57,172
It's going to happen, Mike.

46
00:02:57,263 --> 00:03:00,300
We gave the terrorists Suvarov's route.

47
00:03:03,344 --> 00:03:07,701
I need to come up with a public response
to convince the world that Suvarov's death

48
00:03:07,785 --> 00:03:12,496
only underscores the importance of this
antiterrorism treaty that we just signed.

49
00:03:13,946 --> 00:03:16,858
I'll begin working on a statement, sir.

50
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:18,426
Yes.

51
00:03:22,748 --> 00:03:25,308
Thank you. I'll let the president know.

52
00:03:27,389 --> 00:03:30,028
What? What is it, Mike? What's going on?

53
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:33,541
Who was that?

54
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:37,148
Agent Pierce.

55
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:41,907
- I don't know how to tell you this, sir.
- Just tell me.

56
00:03:41,992 --> 00:03:45,382
- . Logan is with the Suvarovs.
- What are you talking about?

57
00:03:45,472 --> 00:03:48,033
Sir, she got into their limousine.

58
00:03:49,033 --> 00:03:51,422
Oh, my God!

59
00:03:51,513 --> 00:03:53,504
Didn't the Secret Service stop her?

60
00:03:53,594 --> 00:03:57,588
There was no reason to.
The motorcade is under Secret Service escort.

61
00:03:57,674 --> 00:04:00,792
As far as they're concerned,
she's not in any danger.

62
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:04,584
She wants me to call back the motorcade.
She's trying to save them.

63
00:04:04,676 --> 00:04:07,145
- Should I alert them?
- Yes!

64
00:04:07,836 --> 00:04:09,873
No, stop. Wait.

65
00:04:12,598 --> 00:04:17,468
If we warn them,
the terrorists are going to set off the gas.

66
00:04:18,999 --> 00:04:21,115
Where are they now?

67
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,315
They're still on the 118.

68
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,955
Get my wife on the phone.

69
00:04:40,123 --> 00:04:44,003
My aunt visited Los Angeles in the 1950s.

70
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:49,522
She told me this area was filled
with orange groves, but I haven't seen any.

71
00:04:49,605 --> 00:04:52,119
I suppose it's all been built over, no?

72
00:04:53,886 --> 00:04:55,319
Martha?

73
00:04:55,406 --> 00:05:00,196
Yes, I was just trying to remember. I think
your aunt's memory is better than mine.

74
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:03,723
I visited when I was a child,
but I don't recall the orange groves.

75
00:05:05,528 --> 00:05:10,079
<i>- Yeah, this is Pierce.
- Let me speak to my wife.</i>

76
00:05:11,088 --> 00:05:14,002
Mrs. Logan,
it's the president for you on line one.

77
00:05:14,089 --> 00:05:16,080
Thank you, Aaron.

78
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:21,286
- Hello, Charles.
- Listen to me carefully. I want you...

79
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:24,169
Yes, I think they had a wonderful visit.

80
00:05:24,251 --> 00:05:28,006
Anya would very much like us to come
to Moscow. Wouldn't that be lovely?

81
00:05:28,092 --> 00:05:32,051
I want you to tell the Suvarovs
that I need you back here.

82
00:05:32,133 --> 00:05:35,443
- I'll have one of the cars bring you back.
- I don't think so.

83
00:05:35,533 --> 00:05:37,729
Tell them now, while I'm on the phone.

84
00:05:39,014 --> 00:05:43,008
Martha, I know that you want me
to call the motorcade back,

85
00:05:43,095 --> 00:05:45,325
but the terrorists were very specific.

86
00:05:45,415 --> 00:05:47,883
If I don't allow them to attack the motorcade,

87
00:05:47,975 --> 00:05:51,491
they'll release canisters of nerve gas
in multiple locations.

88
00:05:51,576 --> 00:05:55,287
I guess we'll just have to
figure something out before that happens.

89
00:05:55,377 --> 00:05:57,255
We're trying!

90
00:05:57,337 --> 00:06:01,776
We're trying, but we haven't found them yet.
You need to get out of the car.

91
00:06:01,858 --> 00:06:05,249
<i>OK, I should go now,
but call me if there's any change of plans.</i>

92
00:06:05,339 --> 00:06:09,811
- Dammit, Martha!
- OK, bye-bye. I'll talk to you soon.

93
00:06:12,621 --> 00:06:15,931
- She won't get out of the limousine.
- My God!

94
00:06:16,021 --> 00:06:18,535
We gotta do something,
get her out of the car.

95
00:06:18,622 --> 00:06:23,981
I could have one of the trail cars stop and
force her out, say that I need her back here.

96
00:06:24,062 --> 00:06:29,217
You could, but if Martha is desperate
to save the Suvarovs,

97
00:06:29,304 --> 00:06:34,503
she might feel that the only remaining option
is to tell them the truth.

98
00:06:37,585 --> 00:06:42,535
Then Suvarov would know
that I gave him up for assassination.

99
00:06:46,467 --> 00:06:50,541
Sir, do you want me
to recall the motorcade or not?

100
00:07:06,111 --> 00:07:08,625
Meet me in the server room in a few minutes.

101
00:07:08,711 --> 00:07:11,784
- Am I in trouble?
- No, there's something we need to discuss.

102
00:07:11,872 --> 00:07:13,988
- OK.
- And, Edgar?

103
00:07:14,072 --> 00:07:17,304
Don't tell anyone where you're going.
This stays between us.

104
00:07:17,393 --> 00:07:19,385
Sure.

105
00:07:26,115 --> 00:07:31,827
- What did Audrey Raines want?
- She was going over some DOD protocols.

106
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:34,225
- Thought you were monitoring chatter.
- We are.

107
00:07:34,316 --> 00:07:38,469
- Why isn't it on my screen, Carrie?
- I thought you wanted to save time.

108
00:07:38,557 --> 00:07:41,755
I do. It saves me time
by not having to clean up more mistakes.

109
00:07:41,837 --> 00:07:45,354
Mirror everything until we've secured
this nerve gas. Clear?

110
00:07:45,438 --> 00:07:46,997
Yes, sir.

111
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:59,396
The ThumbDrive data Jack sent checks out as
authentic. It's time stamped by DOD and CIA.

112
00:07:59,481 --> 00:08:02,632
So Omicron International
did make Sentox for the military.

113
00:08:02,721 --> 00:08:08,911
Yeah, and some terrorists found out about it.
Or worse, they were in contact with Omicron.

114
00:08:09,002 --> 00:08:13,235
- Who is this Henderson?
- Henderson, senior vice president of R & D.

115
00:08:13,324 --> 00:08:15,315
Jack said he knew him.

116
00:08:15,404 --> 00:08:18,681
- Is he connected with the Sentox?
- It just said he was a senior VP.

117
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:20,756
All right.

118
00:08:27,087 --> 00:08:29,281
- Yeah.
- We've authenticated the data.

119
00:08:29,367 --> 00:08:31,961
Omicron made the Sentox for the military.

120
00:08:32,047 --> 00:08:36,405
OK. I need you to work something up that
gets me in without them knowing I'm CTU.

121
00:08:36,488 --> 00:08:38,080
Do you think it's necessary?

122
00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:40,842
Yeah. There's someone
I don't want to see me coming.

123
00:08:40,929 --> 00:08:42,921
Christopher Henderson?

124
00:08:43,009 --> 00:08:44,329
- Yeah.
- Who is he?

125
00:08:44,409 --> 00:08:47,049
<i>- Someone I used to work for.
- Where?</i>

126
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:50,521
- CTU. He was the man who recruited me.
- You never mentioned him.

127
00:08:50,611 --> 00:08:52,727
I know. Things ended badly between us.

128
00:08:52,811 --> 00:08:54,688
<i>What happened?</i>

129
00:08:55,651 --> 00:08:58,291
I was part of an investigation
that implicated him

130
00:08:58,373 --> 00:09:02,412
in the sale of classified intelligence
to defence contractors.

131
00:09:02,493 --> 00:09:07,045
<i>We never had enough evidence to indict him,
but he lost his job, his command.</i>

132
00:09:07,134 --> 00:09:11,287
Even as he was walking out the door,
he maintained his innocence.

133
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:13,730
He never forgave me for being part of it.

134
00:09:13,815 --> 00:09:17,968
- Are you convinced he did it?
- I was at the time.

135
00:09:18,056 --> 00:09:21,049
Chloe can't find a connection
between the Sentox and him.

136
00:09:21,137 --> 00:09:26,371
Trust me, if Omicron was making Sentox
legally or illegally, Henderson knew about it.

137
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:29,895
- Get back to me when you've got my cover.
- All right, I'm on it.

138
00:09:29,978 --> 00:09:32,698
- What are you doing here?
- Same thing you are.

139
00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:35,976
- Thank you for coming.
- Look, I don't have a lot of time.

140
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,130
We don't have a single lead on this gas.

141
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:42,100
- That's not true. Jack is following a lead.
- How do you know?

142
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:45,856
- I just spoke with him.
- Lynn issued an arrest warrant.

143
00:09:45,942 --> 00:09:49,139
That's why we wanted to talk to you.
Lynn is losing it.

144
00:09:49,222 --> 00:09:51,975
He went after Jack,
then he took Buchanan out of play.

145
00:09:52,062 --> 00:09:56,215
- Lynn is incapable of leading us through this.
- You're working behind his back?

146
00:09:56,303 --> 00:10:00,263
We're afraid if we bring him in,
he might derail the only good lead we have.

147
00:10:00,344 --> 00:10:03,860
We have to help Jack locate the nerve gas
before it's too late.

148
00:10:03,945 --> 00:10:07,939
- What do you want from me?
- Cover for Chloe until Jack reports back.

149
00:10:11,546 --> 00:10:13,663
- Please?
- OK.

150
00:10:13,747 --> 00:10:15,738
Thank you.

151
00:10:18,267 --> 00:10:20,577
OK, fine. Yeah.

152
00:10:21,588 --> 00:10:26,504
That was Secret Service. The motorcade
continues to the airport without incident.

153
00:10:26,589 --> 00:10:31,380
There won't be any warning. When these
people attack, they will be fast and merciless.

154
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:34,428
You can count on that.
I have to talk to this man.

155
00:10:34,511 --> 00:10:37,345
- Maybe I can convince him to hold off.
- Hold off?

156
00:10:37,431 --> 00:10:40,549
Until Martha gets out.
She wasn't supposed to be part of this.

157
00:10:40,632 --> 00:10:46,185
- I don't think that would change his plans.
- He has to know that my wife's in the car.

158
00:10:47,473 --> 00:10:50,466
- I can't lose her, Mike.
- The only way to keep Martha safe

159
00:10:50,554 --> 00:10:54,628
is for me to call Secret Service
and tell them to turn the motorcade around.

160
00:10:54,714 --> 00:10:58,186
What about CTU? Do they have
any active leads on the nerve gas?

161
00:10:58,276 --> 00:11:01,427
As of five minutes ago, they don't.
Nothing that would help.

162
00:11:01,516 --> 00:11:05,192
What am I missing? There's gotta be
some way out that I'm not seeing.

163
00:11:05,276 --> 00:11:07,268
You're not missing anything.

164
00:11:07,357 --> 00:11:11,714
Any action we take to save Martha
would also save the Suvarovs,

165
00:11:11,798 --> 00:11:15,348
and if that happens,
the terrorists will release the gas.

166
00:11:15,438 --> 00:11:19,148
Unfortunately, it's that simple.

167
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,635
Then there's nothing more we can do, Mike.

168
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,474
Unless I warn them...

169
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:32,280
Martha's going to die with the Suvarovs.

170
00:11:39,403 --> 00:11:42,077
Aaron, have there been any changes?

171
00:11:42,164 --> 00:11:45,759
Excuse me? Changes to what, Mrs. Logan?

172
00:11:45,845 --> 00:11:49,042
I was wondering
if there'd been changes to our route.

173
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:52,322
We haven't gotten
any revised instructions, ma'am.

174
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:55,964
Thank you.

175
00:12:04,809 --> 00:12:07,039
- Are you sure you're all right?
- Yes, yes.

176
00:12:07,129 --> 00:12:11,566
I just wanted to make sure
we don't run into any heavy traffic.

177
00:12:31,814 --> 00:12:36,205
Understood. Those protocols
should be coming over shortly.

178
00:12:37,134 --> 00:12:40,331
- Who were you on the phone with?
- Homeland Security.

179
00:12:40,415 --> 00:12:43,373
I gave you orders
to have all systems mirrored to mine.

180
00:12:43,456 --> 00:12:47,210
- I've been doing that.
- Yet somehow you have time to chat.

181
00:12:47,296 --> 00:12:50,528
They needed updated code sets.
It'll just take a minute.

182
00:12:50,617 --> 00:12:54,610
No, it won't.
Stiles, finish her task. Carrie, you're done.

183
00:12:54,698 --> 00:12:59,647
- What do you mean, "done"?
- Fired. You don't work here any more.

184
00:12:59,738 --> 00:13:02,937
- It's not her fault. She...
- One more word, you walk with her.

185
00:13:03,019 --> 00:13:05,375
What's it gonna be?

186
00:13:08,861 --> 00:13:12,012
- Where's Agent O'Brian?
- She had to step away for a minute.

187
00:13:12,101 --> 00:13:14,820
- Where?
- I don't know.

188
00:13:21,743 --> 00:13:26,943
OK, I'm through the gate.
I'm pulling into a parking space now.

189
00:13:30,105 --> 00:13:33,542
- How's my cover?
- I'm still trying to get your credentials in.

190
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:36,140
- You can't get in without them.
- What's wrong?

191
00:13:36,225 --> 00:13:40,299
Omicron's systems don't refresh enough.
We need to push this page in manually.

192
00:13:40,387 --> 00:13:45,018
OK, I'm in. You're going in
under the name of John Barrie, B-a-r-r-i-e.

193
00:13:45,107 --> 00:13:49,340
- You're with a company called Eclipse LLC.
- John Barrie, Eclipse LLC. I got it.

194
00:13:49,428 --> 00:13:53,138
- Hold on. She hasn't planted it yet.
- Chloe, what are you doing in here?

195
00:13:53,229 --> 00:13:56,505
- I asked her to help.
- She doesn't work for you, she works for me.

196
00:13:56,590 --> 00:14:00,219
But I don't,
and DOD has assignment priority over CTU.

197
00:14:00,311 --> 00:14:04,350
We're in the middle of an investigation.
You can’t just take her away from me.

198
00:14:04,431 --> 00:14:08,903
I'm not. We needed a system patch on the
server. Chloe's the only one who could fix it.

199
00:14:08,992 --> 00:14:12,827
Then you come and you ask me.
Everything in this office runs through me.

200
00:14:12,913 --> 00:14:16,223
Lynn, we are all trying to do the same thing.

201
00:14:17,233 --> 00:14:21,147
- Can we please just get past this?
- Yeah, I'm past it. I want Chloe back.

202
00:14:21,234 --> 00:14:25,990
OK, I'm finished here.
Sorry, Mr. McGill. It won't happen again.

203
00:14:39,678 --> 00:14:45,390
Good afternoon. I'm John Barrie with Eclipse.
I've got a 4:30 with R & D.

204
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,831
Thumbprint, please.

205
00:15:05,082 --> 00:15:07,597
- Go on in.
- Thank you.

206
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:23,877
<i>Kick the Macavoy meeting to next week
on Thursday, but keep everything else.</i>

207
00:15:23,966 --> 00:15:26,242
<i>- What about your trip to Washington?
- OK.</i>

208
00:15:26,327 --> 00:15:29,161
<i>I gotta talk to Kagen tomorrow.
I'll get back to you.</i>

209
00:15:29,247 --> 00:15:32,638
- Can I help you, sir?
- Sorry. I was looking for the men's room.

210
00:15:32,728 --> 00:15:34,924
Over there. Second door.

211
00:15:35,008 --> 00:15:36,999
Thank you.

212
00:15:45,891 --> 00:15:48,280
<i>Audrey Raines.</i>

213
00:15:48,371 --> 00:15:51,603
I need you to lose a secretary.
Her name is Joanna Tandy.

214
00:15:51,692 --> 00:15:54,365
All right. I'll take care of it.

215
00:16:12,536 --> 00:16:14,606
- Henderson's office.
- Ms Tandy?

216
00:16:14,696 --> 00:16:16,926
- Yes.
- Jane Espenson from accounting.

217
00:16:17,016 --> 00:16:19,611
We need you to check some of these invoices.

218
00:16:19,697 --> 00:16:23,054
<i>- What invoices?
- It's difficult to explain over the phone.</i>

219
00:16:23,138 --> 00:16:25,333
<i>Would you mind popping down for a minute?</i>

220
00:16:25,418 --> 00:16:28,058
<i>- Fine.
- Thank you.</i>

221
00:16:28,139 --> 00:16:31,017
There's a problem in accounting.
I'll be right back.

222
00:16:31,099 --> 00:16:33,091
<i>Yeah, OK.</i>

223
00:17:00,505 --> 00:17:02,974
Jack. Jack.

224
00:17:15,228 --> 00:17:19,665
Just for the record,
I never believed you were dead.

225
00:17:20,469 --> 00:17:22,699
What are you doing here?

226
00:17:22,789 --> 00:17:26,988
Earlier this morning, terrorists gained control
of a large quantity of Sentox.

227
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:30,381
Omicron made it.
I pulled up the executive list, you were on it.

228
00:17:30,471 --> 00:17:34,623
Sure, I work here. Omicron had the contract.
We manufactured the stuff.

229
00:17:34,712 --> 00:17:38,022
But every gram of it went to the DOD.
It's all accounted for.

230
00:17:38,112 --> 00:17:43,392
That can't be true. We have confirmation
the terrorists are in control of 19 canisters.

231
00:17:43,473 --> 00:17:46,227
Are you accusing me
of being in bed with terrorists?

232
00:17:46,313 --> 00:17:48,908
- I'm following the leads.
- The leads are wrong.

233
00:17:48,994 --> 00:17:51,747
DOD destroyed the entire stockpile.

234
00:17:51,835 --> 00:17:56,990
Sentox was responsible for the death of the
people in the mall less than two hours ago.

235
00:17:57,076 --> 00:18:01,195
- The news said it was chlorine gas.
- That was a story to stop widespread panic.

236
00:18:01,276 --> 00:18:05,156
Come on, Christopher.
You know how this works.

237
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:15,113
The terrorists have threatened
to release the rest of the gas.

238
00:18:21,761 --> 00:18:23,592
Good God.

239
00:18:28,242 --> 00:18:33,032
Whoever's implicating me in this
knows my history with CTU.

240
00:18:33,123 --> 00:18:36,958
I mean, I'm an easy target.
This is not a coincidence.

241
00:18:38,163 --> 00:18:43,193
Look, Jack. I know the deal between us, but I
swear to you, I've got nothing to do with this.

242
00:18:43,285 --> 00:18:47,074
- I can't afford to take your word on this.
- You'll have to take my word.

243
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:51,956
11 people died. Hundreds of thousands
of others will if they release the Sentox.

244
00:18:52,046 --> 00:18:55,084
You're not hearing me, Jack.
I had nothing to do with this.

245
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:57,158
Then prove it to me.

246
00:19:12,811 --> 00:19:15,563
I need access
to Omicron's Sentox programme.

247
00:19:15,651 --> 00:19:20,680
I'm doing it now. The entire operation
was run from a bunker across the campus.

248
00:19:20,772 --> 00:19:23,162
Let me see the bunker.

249
00:19:28,813 --> 00:19:30,805
Let's go.

250
00:20:05,733 --> 00:20:09,170
Chatter analysis came in.
They decoded some words and phrases.

251
00:20:09,253 --> 00:20:12,246
- What were they saying?
- It's too scrambled.

252
00:20:12,334 --> 00:20:16,327
But number strings keep coming up -
5, 110, 10.

253
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:19,852
- Freeways?
- The routes Suvarov's taking to the airport.

254
00:20:19,935 --> 00:20:24,135
The only other phrase I could decode
refers to the downtown corridor.

255
00:20:24,216 --> 00:20:26,491
How long ago did this chatter start?

256
00:20:26,577 --> 00:20:28,966
About 30 minutes ago.

257
00:20:31,378 --> 00:20:33,289
Come on.

258
00:20:34,818 --> 00:20:38,937
- Have we expanded the search?
- I've got air surveillance east of Glendale.

259
00:20:39,019 --> 00:20:41,692
- North?
- Edwards Air Force Base is giving support.

260
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:44,214
We're still at a dead end on finding new leads.

261
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:48,340
Excuse me, there might be an attack
on President Suvarov's motorcade.

262
00:20:48,421 --> 00:20:52,734
- What?
- Edgar monitored some chatter from NSA.

263
00:20:52,822 --> 00:20:55,656
Why are you analysing chatter
unrelated to the gas?

264
00:20:55,742 --> 00:20:58,815
- It came through on one of my filters.
- We found something.

265
00:20:58,903 --> 00:21:02,692
Don't you want to alert Secret Service?
He is on his way to the airport.

266
00:21:02,784 --> 00:21:05,583
Based on an unsubstantiated theory
from two analysts?

267
00:21:05,664 --> 00:21:08,224
I've been embarrassed enough for one day.

268
00:21:08,305 --> 00:21:11,456
Can we at least devote some resources
to try to confirm this?

269
00:21:11,545 --> 00:21:13,616
I'm sorry. Maybe I wasn't clear.

270
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:19,339
No. Now go downstairs and focus on
what you're supposed to be doing.

271
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:35,745
I don't think it would be a bad idea
to pass along the intel.

272
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:40,222
Well, I do.
I don't want to hear another word about it.

273
00:21:46,312 --> 00:21:50,022
- Yes.
- Our men are in place. How far out are they?

274
00:21:50,113 --> 00:21:52,627
They will be there in less than 20 minutes.

275
00:21:52,713 --> 00:21:55,023
Are you sure no one's gonna interfere?

276
00:21:55,114 --> 00:21:59,427
I don't think so. Logan knows
the consequences if that happens.

277
00:21:59,514 --> 00:22:04,067
But be alert. Make sure they haven't
placed any of their people near you.

278
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:07,751
- If police show up, we'll deal with them.
- Good.

279
00:22:08,196 --> 00:22:10,791
I'll call you when it's over.

280
00:22:10,877 --> 00:22:13,186
Let's go. Let's go.

281
00:22:15,997 --> 00:22:21,471
Keep them armed. If things
don't go as planned, I'll use them here.

282
00:22:29,001 --> 00:22:31,310
- I'm busy.
- I looked at this chatter report.

283
00:22:31,401 --> 00:22:34,599
I think that we need to let
Secret Service know of the threat.

284
00:22:34,681 --> 00:22:37,150
I'm not gonna repeat my orders
to every person.

285
00:22:37,241 --> 00:22:42,442
My people are not gonna chase that white
elephant. They're trying to locate Sentox gas.

286
00:22:42,523 --> 00:22:44,719
Has it occurred to you that if this is real,

287
00:22:44,803 --> 00:22:49,320
then it's likely the terrorists who have
the Sentox are the ones planning this attack?

288
00:22:49,404 --> 00:22:53,318
This is an unverified threat. If you want
to hand it off to NSA, be my guest.

289
00:22:53,405 --> 00:22:57,797
NSA can't recall the motorcade
without a time-consuming approval process.

290
00:22:57,886 --> 00:23:01,323
Good! That process
helps eliminate false threats.

291
00:23:01,406 --> 00:23:04,843
- Look, we don't have that time.
- Ms Raines! Ms Raines.

292
00:23:04,927 --> 00:23:08,238
This office has made enough mistakes
and I intend to stop it.

293
00:23:08,328 --> 00:23:13,642
Now let my people focus on their work
or I will have you escorted out of here.

294
00:23:14,089 --> 00:23:16,045
Thank you.

295
00:24:04,859 --> 00:24:08,136
Secret Service won't act on this
unless Lynn verifies it.

296
00:24:08,219 --> 00:24:10,450
- He's never gonna back you up.
- Yes, he is.

297
00:24:10,539 --> 00:24:15,137
I need you to hack into Lynn's account. I'll
forge a message to look like it came from him.

298
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,734
- That's illegal.
- Fine.

299
00:24:16,821 --> 00:24:20,700
Put a blanket on my subnet
to make it look like I'm doing something else.

300
00:24:20,782 --> 00:24:23,775
- We could all end up in jail.
- Think about it for a second.

301
00:24:23,862 --> 00:24:29,779
The Russian president, his wife, about 35
Secret Service, all dead in a few minutes.

302
00:24:29,864 --> 00:24:32,503
All right.
For the record, this is not a good idea.

303
00:24:32,584 --> 00:24:38,581
All right. I'll compose the message. As soon
as you have the forged verification, call me.

304
00:24:54,468 --> 00:24:56,459
Curtis, excuse me.

305
00:24:56,549 --> 00:24:58,904
We need to talk.

306
00:24:58,989 --> 00:25:02,744
- What is it?
- We've got a problem with Lynn.

307
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:04,821
Yeah, he's not listening to anybody.

308
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:08,062
- It's gonna cost lives.
- Give him time. He'll come around.

309
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:11,348
Curtis, we don't have time.
We've got to get Bill back here.

310
00:25:11,432 --> 00:25:14,071
- That won't happen.
- We need to make it happen.

311
00:25:14,152 --> 00:25:16,382
What are you suggesting?

312
00:25:17,433 --> 00:25:19,993
- Section 1-12.
- On what grounds?

313
00:25:20,073 --> 00:25:22,667
Lynn is mentally incapable of running CTU.

314
00:25:22,754 --> 00:25:27,703
I may not agree with his choices, but going
from there to mentally unfit, that's a stretch.

315
00:25:27,794 --> 00:25:30,434
No, it's not, and you know it.
You've seen him.

316
00:25:30,515 --> 00:25:33,713
With Bill in custody,
you're the only one that can invoke it.

317
00:25:33,796 --> 00:25:37,106
- Look, I don't know, Audrey.
- Yes, you do.

318
00:25:37,676 --> 00:25:42,387
Curtis, CTU is barely functional.
You are the one that can turn it around.

319
00:25:42,477 --> 00:25:47,598
Even if I agreed, section 1-12 requires
documentation, testimony, groundwork.

320
00:25:47,678 --> 00:25:52,629
The record of what is going on right now
is documentation enough.

321
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:56,108
Curtis, please.

322
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,271
Think about it.

323
00:25:59,841 --> 00:26:02,560
- I will.
- Good. Thank you.

324
00:26:28,886 --> 00:26:30,878
Mr. President.

325
00:26:32,767 --> 00:26:34,918
Come in, Mike.

326
00:26:36,087 --> 00:26:40,320
The motorcade is only 15 minutes away
from the airport.

327
00:26:40,928 --> 00:26:42,920
Yeah.

328
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:55,762
My father told me that life was about problem
solving, that every problem had a solution.

329
00:26:55,851 --> 00:26:59,447
You tell me where the solution is on this one.

330
00:27:08,854 --> 00:27:11,927
I don't have an answer, Mr. President.

331
00:27:13,775 --> 00:27:18,053
But if you want
the Suvarov motorcade to turn back,

332
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:20,934
I need to do it now.

333
00:27:30,418 --> 00:27:34,935
We know the terrorists are willing
to kill civilians. And the low...

334
00:27:35,019 --> 00:27:41,095
the low end of the casualty range
on this one is 100,000 lives.

335
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:42,739
Yes, sir.

336
00:27:45,221 --> 00:27:51,617
I decided before that I couldn't risk all those
lives to save one man, the Russian president.

337
00:27:53,583 --> 00:27:55,778
I can't risk those lives now.

338
00:27:56,783 --> 00:27:59,093
Even to save my own wife.

339
00:27:59,184 --> 00:28:01,414
Damn you, Martha.

340
00:28:01,504 --> 00:28:04,099
Putting me in this position.

341
00:28:05,105 --> 00:28:07,573
You brought it on yourself.

342
00:28:14,307 --> 00:28:16,104
Mike.

343
00:28:25,549 --> 00:28:27,779
Pray with me, Mike.

344
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:35,946
Mr. President, with all due respect,

345
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:39,829
this is a personal matter.

346
00:28:40,831 --> 00:28:43,393
- I don't...
- Please, Mike.

347
00:28:58,915 --> 00:29:02,704
- How much longer until we can send this?
- A couple minutes. I'm almost in.

348
00:29:02,796 --> 00:29:06,346
- We don't have a couple minutes.
- I'm almost there.

349
00:29:06,437 --> 00:29:09,554
- Oh, no! Lynn cut us off.
- What do I do?

350
00:29:09,637 --> 00:29:12,516
I think it's too late to do anything.

351
00:29:16,598 --> 00:29:19,671
Did you think I wouldn't notice you
accessing my comm?

352
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:24,151
- Listen. We need to talk.
- Shut up. They're against CTU, against me.

353
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,916
What is this?
- We were warning Secret Service of an attack.

354
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,721
Take Mr. Stiles and Ms O'Brian.
Put 'em in Holding.

355
00:29:30,801 --> 00:29:33,599
And then escort Audrey Raines out of CTU.

356
00:29:33,682 --> 00:29:36,150
I can't do that.

357
00:29:36,242 --> 00:29:38,313
Yes, you can. It's a direct order. Do it.

358
00:29:38,403 --> 00:29:42,363
You forced them to work covertly.
You're not behaving rationally, Lynn.

359
00:29:42,443 --> 00:29:45,959
You and you, take them all into custody,
including Mr. Manning.

360
00:29:46,044 --> 00:29:48,639
If you try to carry that out,
I will draw my weapon.

361
00:29:48,724 --> 00:29:53,117
- If he draws his weapon, shoot him.
- This is out of control. Don't make it worse.

362
00:29:53,566 --> 00:29:57,923
Why are you hesitating?
I gave you an order. Now do it!

363
00:30:02,767 --> 00:30:04,759
- What should I do, Mr. Manning?
- What?

364
00:30:04,848 --> 00:30:09,445
I'm relieving you of your command
under the incapacity clause of section 1-12.

365
00:30:09,529 --> 00:30:12,168
- You will do no such thing.
- Take him away.

366
00:30:12,249 --> 00:30:14,365
You can't do that.

367
00:30:15,170 --> 00:30:18,402
He can't do this. Don't touch me.

368
00:30:20,371 --> 00:30:27,050
This is an unjustified usurpation of authority.
You hear me? We're in the middle of a crisis.

369
00:30:27,132 --> 00:30:33,083
There are gonna be repercussions. Everyone
involved with this is gonna face prosecution.

370
00:30:33,173 --> 00:30:37,133
<i>- Security office.
- This is Manning. Release Bill Buchanan.</i>

371
00:30:37,214 --> 00:30:41,288
Inform Division he's been reinstated
as director of CTU under section 1-12.

372
00:30:41,375 --> 00:30:43,525
<i>Right away, sir.</i>

373
00:30:45,296 --> 00:30:47,890
Everyone, get back to your stations.

374
00:31:03,979 --> 00:31:05,492
Fill me in.

375
00:31:05,579 --> 00:31:09,812
Chloe and Edgar detected chatter
indicating an attack on Suvarov's motorcade.

376
00:31:09,901 --> 00:31:12,017
- How'd they get the route?
- We don't know.

377
00:31:12,101 --> 00:31:14,171
The likely point of intercept is downtown.

378
00:31:14,261 --> 00:31:16,651
- Is Secret Service notified?
- Lynn refused.

379
00:31:16,742 --> 00:31:20,816
- Notify Secret Service now.
- I need to override the firewall Lynn put up.

380
00:31:20,902 --> 00:31:22,814
- Here.
- I need Carrie. He fired her.

381
00:31:22,903 --> 00:31:25,701
Have security reinstate her. Edgar.

382
00:31:25,783 --> 00:31:29,743
Pull up satellite on all possible
intercept points and call the president.

383
00:31:29,824 --> 00:31:33,453
- Where are we on the location of the gas?
- No substantial progress.

384
00:31:33,545 --> 00:31:38,222
- What about the lead Jack was following?
- He traced the gas to Omicron International.

385
00:31:38,306 --> 00:31:39,945
- Is that where Jack is?
- Yes.

386
00:31:40,026 --> 00:31:43,258
Mr. Buchanan, the president's on the line.

387
00:31:43,347 --> 00:31:45,144
We have intelligence

388
00:31:45,227 --> 00:31:51,178
that indicates President Suvarov's motorcade
may be attacked in the next few minutes.

389
00:31:55,149 --> 00:31:59,142
- Is that so?
- Yes, sir. We are notifying Secret Service.

390
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:02,509
What we can tell you
is that if the attack happens,

391
00:32:02,591 --> 00:32:04,980
it will occur in or around the downtown area.

392
00:32:05,511 --> 00:32:09,585
<i>The motorcade is approaching
that area now, sir.</i>

393
00:32:13,632 --> 00:32:15,624
Mr. President?

394
00:32:19,794 --> 00:32:22,752
Bill, Mike Novick.

395
00:32:23,194 --> 00:32:26,426
<i>The president is at a loss for words.</i>

396
00:32:26,515 --> 00:32:31,431
His wife is in the Suvarovs' limousine.

397
00:32:35,597 --> 00:32:37,953
Thank you. You've done a good job.

398
00:32:41,758 --> 00:32:45,388
- What do we do?
- There's nothing we can do, sir.

399
00:32:46,358 --> 00:32:49,830
CTU is informing Secret Service.

400
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:53,230
They will no doubt take defensive measures,

401
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:57,599
which makes the attack
substantially less likely to succeed.

402
00:33:12,084 --> 00:33:15,521
<i>- Red Protocol. Turn back.
- Protocol red! Protocol red!</i>

403
00:33:15,604 --> 00:33:20,042
Hold on tight. We're turning around.
We just received intelligence about a threat.

404
00:33:21,485 --> 00:33:23,363
They're turning around.

405
00:33:28,327 --> 00:33:31,319
We're under attack. We need backup now!

406
00:33:44,850 --> 00:33:47,763
That's a missile fire.
The motorcade's been hit.

407
00:33:48,811 --> 00:33:50,130
Aaron.

408
00:33:50,211 --> 00:33:52,600
Aaron. Oh, God!

409
00:33:57,732 --> 00:33:58,802
No!

410
00:34:30,859 --> 00:34:32,497
Let's go! Let's go!

411
00:34:43,061 --> 00:34:45,622
Are you OK?

412
00:35:00,225 --> 00:35:02,785
<i>- Novick.
- The motorcade's been attacked.</i>

413
00:35:02,865 --> 00:35:05,585
<i>- How badly?
- Bad. We sustained major casualties.</i>

414
00:35:05,665 --> 00:35:09,706
<i>- What about Mrs. Logan?
- They're shaken, but alive. Tell the president.</i>

415
00:35:09,786 --> 00:35:11,584
I will. Thank you.

416
00:35:13,747 --> 00:35:16,466
Your wife survived the attack.

417
00:35:17,628 --> 00:35:20,426
CTU intervened in time.

418
00:35:22,228 --> 00:35:24,618
Thank God.

419
00:35:25,549 --> 00:35:28,508
What about the Suvarovs?

420
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:31,309
They were shaken up, but they'll be OK.

421
00:35:35,752 --> 00:35:38,903
He's going to think I tipped off CTU.

422
00:35:38,992 --> 00:35:42,702
It won't matter to him
that I tried to keep my end of the bargain.

423
00:35:42,792 --> 00:35:45,182
I agree.

424
00:35:45,273 --> 00:35:50,428
We need to prepare ourselves
for the terrorists' retaliation.

425
00:36:05,797 --> 00:36:08,756
All the work on the Sentox project
was run out of here.

426
00:36:08,838 --> 00:36:11,033
- How restricted was access?
- Extremely.

427
00:36:11,118 --> 00:36:15,715
For security reasons, each contract was run
out of its own separate, dedicated bunker.

428
00:36:15,799 --> 00:36:21,750
Each bunker is completely sealed.
Nothing gets in and nothing gets out.

429
00:36:30,922 --> 00:36:32,914
This is gonna take some time.

430
00:36:33,002 --> 00:36:36,200
I've gotta merge some files,
find out who worked on this.

431
00:36:36,283 --> 00:36:38,115
You're senior VP. You don't know?

432
00:36:38,204 --> 00:36:44,678
Give me a break. 8,000 people work for this
company. I gotta run a sort. It'll take a minute.

433
00:36:44,765 --> 00:36:47,325
So who's the honcho over at CTU now?

434
00:36:48,045 --> 00:36:51,436
- Bill Buchanan.
- Buchanan?

435
00:36:51,525 --> 00:36:54,997
What a stiff. No wonder
everything's going to hell over there.

436
00:36:55,086 --> 00:36:57,317
You get rid of everybody who can do the job.

437
00:36:57,407 --> 00:37:00,205
- You made your own bed.
- You accused the wrong man.

438
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:03,883
- I just showed them what I found.
- I was framed.

439
00:37:03,969 --> 00:37:08,167
- By who?
- Nina Myers, George Mason, who knows?

440
00:37:09,809 --> 00:37:15,841
But I tell you, the one thing that just
hangs on me, the one thing that just hurts me

441
00:37:15,931 --> 00:37:18,206
is that you didn't believe me.

442
00:37:18,291 --> 00:37:20,760
You made it impossible to believe you.

443
00:37:21,772 --> 00:37:26,766
How could I possibly defend you?
You couldn't even defend yourself.

444
00:37:26,853 --> 00:37:29,651
No one gave me the chance.

445
00:37:37,055 --> 00:37:41,094
OK, we've got something here.
Lead scientist, head of project Sentox,

446
00:37:41,176 --> 00:37:44,452
- Allen Burkett, PhD.
- I'm gonna need to speak to him.

447
00:37:44,536 --> 00:37:48,689
You're gonna have a problem. Died in
a helicopter crash in Geneva two years ago.

448
00:37:48,777 --> 00:37:51,735
Let's see what else we've got.

449
00:37:51,818 --> 00:37:53,649
This is bizarre.

450
00:37:53,738 --> 00:37:58,573
Two other scientists on the Sentox project,
one drowned on a diving trip in the Bahamas,

451
00:37:58,659 --> 00:38:03,097
the other burned to death in a car accident
two weeks later. What the hell is going on?

452
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:07,174
CTU's gonna have to break it down.
How do I upload files ready to transfer?

453
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:09,536
We need IT. They're next door.

454
00:38:09,621 --> 00:38:11,612
I'm gonna get somebody to help us.

455
00:38:11,701 --> 00:38:15,980
I'll let CTU know
that we're sending the files over.

456
00:38:22,304 --> 00:38:24,259
Hello?

457
00:38:24,344 --> 00:38:26,380
Dammit!

458
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:59,789
Oh, my God!

459
00:38:59,871 --> 00:39:02,590
How could I be so stupid?

460
00:39:07,072 --> 00:39:09,348
<i>- Yes?
- Yeah, it's me.</i>

461
00:39:09,432 --> 00:39:14,632
I listened to everything Bauer had to say. CTU
does not have enough information to hurt us.

462
00:39:14,714 --> 00:39:16,705
<i>What about Bauer?</i>

463
00:39:16,794 --> 00:39:20,026
Well, in about one minute, he'll be dead.

464
00:40:11,284 --> 00:40:13,435
Agh!

465
00:40:13,525 --> 00:40:15,516
Argh!

466
00:40:36,729 --> 00:40:40,689
Look, tell the media
we don't know how the terrorists found out

467
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:43,046
about the Suvarovs' route.

468
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:45,850
We're looking into it now.

469
00:40:45,931 --> 00:40:49,640
Mike, I've been thinking that, diplomatically,

470
00:40:49,732 --> 00:40:52,644
we should play up the fact
Martha was in the vehicle.

471
00:40:52,732 --> 00:40:57,409
- Why is that, sir?
- It'll get rid of suspicion we might've been...

472
00:41:01,254 --> 00:41:04,212
There he is.

473
00:41:09,696 --> 00:41:11,926
- Hello.
- We had an understanding.

474
00:41:12,016 --> 00:41:14,610
I had nothing to do with this. Believe me.

475
00:41:14,696 --> 00:41:18,292
It was your job to make sure
no one interfered with the attack.

476
00:41:18,377 --> 00:41:21,847
It happened outside of my authority.
I told no one.

477
00:41:21,938 --> 00:41:24,975
If Russia isn't going to pay
with the life of its president,

478
00:41:25,059 --> 00:41:29,177
then its new ally, the United States,
will pay with the lives of its citizens.

479
00:41:29,259 --> 00:41:32,218
Mr. President,
this is our final conversation. Goodbye.

480
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:33,813
No! Wait!
