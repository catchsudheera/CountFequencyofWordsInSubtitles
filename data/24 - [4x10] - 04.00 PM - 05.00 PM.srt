1
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:18,238
San Gabriel Island reactor's just gone critical.
Core material is now airborne.

2
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,910
I thought we had more time.

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,673
<i>At this REM rate the radiation will get stronger</i>

4
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,752
<i>and will spill into the atmosphere</i>
<i>until the core is exhausted. </i>

5
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:29,912
Son, you've done everything you can,
now get out of there.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,515
<i>Evacuating won't make any difference, sir. </i>
<i>We've already been exposed. </i>

7
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,878
Jack has got to find the override
before the rest of these reactors go critical.

8
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,231
I know about you and him,
and I am not OK with it.

9
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,313
- You and I aren't together.
- We were trying to work things out.

10
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,994
Yeah, I tried.
But you kept putting it off.

11
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:50,038
- What did you say to Paul?
- That I'm filing for divorce.

12
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,354
- Somebody set me up.
- Thousands of lives are at stake.

13
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:57,955
Where are the people
who control the override?

14
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:01,316
- Talk to me, Sarah.
- I'm not a spy.

15
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,272
Erin, Powell's dead. He was hit
by a sniper when we arrested him.

16
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:13,673
- <i>Get anything from him before he was killed?</i>
- No. But I got his last ten cellphone calls.

17
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,991
He called two numbers repeatedly.
We traced one of them to Marianne Taylor.

18
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,071
You're under arrest.

19
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,875
Don't move.
Drop the weapon!

20
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,829
Listen carefully, Behrooz.
Government agents found me. I made a deal.

21
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,434
- I don't understand.
- <i>You're going to be OK.</i>

22
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,829
I'm going to help them stop your father.

23
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,717
You broke my heart.

24
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,711
If you kill me,
Mother will tell them everything.

25
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,872
If you don't believe me look outside.
They're coming to pick me up.

26
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,111
- Drop the gun!
- You'll hit the boy.

27
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,111
- Behrooz!
- Mom!

28
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,717
That stairwell leads to the basement. He's got
to go down. Set up a link with CTU now!

29
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:01,477
If you can't save my son,
I am happy to see the reactors melt down.

30
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,393
Did you get that?

31
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,757
- Driscoll.
- <i>Erin, it's Jack. </i>

32
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,479
Araz is on the move.
We're ready to move in now.

33
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,917
Dad, you're choking me.

34
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,389
Jack, it's Jim. Bring us up to speed.

35
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,678
We've a hostage situation involving
one of the men involved in the attacks.

36
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,911
We're pulling up his ID now.

37
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,516
His name is Navi Araz. He was granted
American citizenship five years ago.

38
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,637
- Who's the hostage?
- His 17-year-old son, Behrooz.

39
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,154
He broke ranks.
Father sees him as a liability.

40
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,231
Araz knows we have his wife.

41
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:46,029
He's worried that if he kills the boy,
she'll cooperate with us.

42
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,953
- What does she say?
- She'll help us find the override

43
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,918
and stop the nuclear meltdowns
if we rescue her son.

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,073
So the father'll stall and keep the kid alive
until the reactors blow.

45
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:56,956
That's right.

46
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,079
We already lost one in California.
Can we trust this woman to help us?

47
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,799
She'll do everything she can
to protect her son.

48
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,872
OK. Whatever you need, you got.
Just get that kid.

49
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,997
Erin, I need a thermal
satellite scan of the building.

50
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,914
We're looking for two heat sources
in remote areas of the basement.

51
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,276
- I'll call you as soon as we have something.
- Yeah.

52
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,920
You're running out of time. Save my son.

53
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,680
Bring her with us. We're gonna need her.

54
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,391
I said get on the floor.

55
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,550
You're not my son.

56
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,438
Why? Because I don't
want to kill innocent people?

57
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:44,399
Because you're weak,
and you stand for nothing!

58
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,630
I always saw you as something more.

59
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,312
And now...

60
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,075
I don't even recognise you.

61
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:56,630
Will that make it easier for you to kill me?

62
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,110
- Yes, it's me.
- Did you find your son?

63
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,474
Yes.

64
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,393
- <i>Is he dead?</i>
- Not yet.

65
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,516
Is there a problem, Navi?

66
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:18,195
Government agents arrested Dina
and surrounded the building.

67
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:21,317
I need the boy for leverage,
but I'm not sure I can hold them off.

68
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:25,109
- Has Dina told them anything?
- I don't think so.

69
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,556
And she won't, as long as I don't kill the boy.

70
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:31,950
How much more time
do you need to melt down the plants?

71
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,635
- One hour, maybe two.
- Why? Why so long?

72
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,598
They have programmers
trying to prevent meltdown.

73
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:42,468
We have to manipulate each plant
individually, and that takes time.

74
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,749
I'll hold them off as long as I can.

75
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,034
I know you will.

76
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,393
- Yeah?
- <i> We've found Araz and his son. </i>

77
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:04,552
We have two readings
in the north wing of the basement.

78
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,312
- <i>What's there?</i>
- Laundry room.

79
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,995
- How many ways in?
- One, but there's a laundry chute.

80
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,516
- Is it accessible?
- From the third floor.

81
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,956
OK. We're on our way.
We got him. He's in the laundry room.

82
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:20,271
I need two teams to the north wing.
Set up a hard perimeter.

83
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,796
- I need a fast line and a rappelling harness.
- <i>Copy that. </i>

84
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,269
Lee, get me Dina Araz.

85
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,511
- We're putting her into play.
- <i>Got it. </i>

86
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,399
Where are the latest timing estimates?

87
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,789
Right here.

88
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,713
These are from 40 minutes ago.
They update every 15.

89
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,870
I'm sorry. I'm upset about my mother.

90
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,235
You have to put your emotions on hold.

91
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,834
- We're in a crisis.
- My mother just died.

92
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,990
I can't put that on hold.

93
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:55,477
I'm sorry, that was callous of me.

94
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:02,357
But I'm really depending on you now, Edgar.
Please come through for me.

95
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,875
- I'll get those figures as soon as we're done.
- Thank you.

96
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,757
Bring me up to speed.

97
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:12,958
- We're trying to hold off the meltdowns.
- How's that going?

98
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,999
Our programmers can slow it down,
but they won't be able to stop it.

99
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,310
We still have to find the override.

100
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:24,394
Jack has a suspect cornered in a medical
facility, and we're fairly certain that this man

101
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,391
is a key architect in today's events.

102
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,198
- Can we take him alive?
- Unknown.

103
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,748
- Marianne Taylor?
- Curtis is interrogating her.

104
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,796
- I want to call my lawyer.
- Really?

105
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,314
- I do have rights.
- Yeah?

106
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,829
Henry Powell had rights too.

107
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,511
I don't know any Henry Powell.

108
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,559
The one who helped
the terrorists obtain the override.

109
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,117
He's right here. Want to say hello?

110
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,280
Bring him in.

111
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,676
God, you're sick. Sick bastard.

112
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,513
- CTU didn't kill him.
- Well, then, who did?

113
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,398
The people who planted
the bomb under your car.

114
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,755
They've caught up with you.

115
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:40,515
Even if we let you go,
you'd be dead in 15 minutes.

116
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,873
Get him out of here.

117
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:59,357
Your only chance to survive
is to tell us what you know.

118
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,797
- I want a deal.
- You get to live. That's your deal.

119
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,635
All right.

120
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:14,350
- Who did you and Powell work for?
- I don't know. I only dealt with him.

121
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,749
Why'd he send you into CTU?

122
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,195
To cover his tracks
if it became necessary.

123
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,398
And after Audrey Raines saw him
at the warehouse it became necessary?

124
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,276
Yes.

125
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,875
Did he work directly for the terrorists?
Or someone associated?

126
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:32,511
- I told you, I don't know.
- I need names who can get us to the override.

127
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,670
I don't have any names.

128
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,755
- But I can get 'em for you.
- How?

129
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:47,600
Powell kept a file on his computer
in his office downtown. It was a...

130
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:52,390
An insurance policy, in case either of us
ever needed a bargaining chip.

131
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,597
- Give me the code.
- It can't be accessed externally.

132
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:01,198
It requires a thumbprint identification,
either his or mine.

133
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:05,512
Since he's dead, it'll have to be mine.

134
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,038
All right, you set?
Yeah.

135
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,917
- We've found them.
- Where?

136
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,117
Laundry room. Our satellite
picked up two thermal images.

137
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,236
- Then Behrooz is still alive?
- Yes.

138
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,470
I need you to distract your husband.

139
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,552
I'll take you to the basement.
You'll call your husband,

140
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,677
- keep him on the line as long as possible.
- All right.

141
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,637
Let's go.

142
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,551
OK.

143
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,357
- You ready?
- Ready.

144
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,593
OK. Keep going.

145
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,398
Six feet.

146
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,754
Four feet.

147
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,070
Three feet... Stop.

148
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,037
All right, come here.

149
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,036
OK. Make the call.

150
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,715
And remember,
keep him on as long as you can.

151
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,670
- Yes?
- <i>It's Dina. </i>

152
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,756
- Where are you?
- In the hospital.

153
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,229
- What have you told them?
- <i>Nothing. </i>

154
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,551
And I'll keep my mouth shut
if you release our son.

155
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,349
- You know I can't do that.
- At least promise me you won't kill him.

156
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,000
<i>Navi, please. He's our son. </i>

157
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:34,038
You turned him against me.
Our sacrifice is nothing

158
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:37,510
compared to the martyrs
who have given all for our cause.

159
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,194
No. He can still be of service.

160
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,840
- Is he still alive?
- <i>Yes. </i>

161
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,956
And he will remain alive
as long as you remain silent.

162
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,156
How am I to trust you now?

163
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:52,949
We planned this mission together.
We thought it out with one mind.

164
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,190
But you betrayed me. Don't tell me that!

165
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:58,636
I have visual on the suspect.
The boy is still alive.

166
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,836
I'm ready to proceed. Go.

167
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:10,314
Your conspiracy with him is over.
I won't allow you to continue it in front of me.

168
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:15,269
The boy is all I have, the only thing that
keeps them from storming through that door.

169
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,592
Of course it's true. But in the end,
he'll wind up a martyr just the same...

170
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,433
Slowly retract the rig. I'm in position.

171
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,397
...you'll suffer even worse.

172
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,075
You'll have to live knowing
that everything you loved is dead.

173
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,310
Your son, your brother...

174
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:34,232
Yes. Your brother too...

175
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:44,114
Don't move.

176
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:09,035
Get up slowly.
Put your hands on your head.

177
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,270
Stay with her.

178
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,669
Put your hands on your...

179
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:18,117
Hostiles engaged!
I repeat, hostiles engaged!

180
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:32,796
I don't want to have to kill you, but I will.

181
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,110
Now get up, slowly.

182
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,673
Interlock your fingers.

183
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:04,355
It's OK, son. Just put the gun down.

184
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,795
It's over.

185
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,355
It's over.

186
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,076
Drop the gun!

187
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,276
Drop the gun!

188
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,033
Please, son, put the gun down.

189
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:31,830
Hands on your head.
Turn around.

190
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,357
<i> Yeah, copy that. Move in now. </i>

191
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,270
Behrooz, are you all right?

192
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,272
I killed him. I did it, I killed Father.

193
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:47,193
Your son is safe.
He's alive. We did what you asked.

194
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,999
- Now where is the override?
- I don't know that.

195
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:53,231
I have an address where
work behind the attacks was done.

196
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,356
That's not the deal we made.

197
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,238
That's all I know.
I can only tell you what I know.

198
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,598
- What's the address?
- 24878 Alvert Street.

199
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,671
- What's there?
- It was a drop-off,

200
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,069
the place we got our final assignments.

201
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:11,358
It was the last place I saw the men
who took possession of the override.

202
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,398
- When was that?
- Yesterday.

203
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:18,356
Send in a team. Tell them
to set up a perimeter. No one goes in.

204
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,237
You got it.
- These two?

205
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,393
Until we know she's not lying,
they come with us.

206
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:42,198
So this Marianne Taylor claims
she has to access the file personally?

207
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:45,352
- Yes, she does.
- And do you believe her?

208
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:51,150
I'm not sure. The polygraph
indicates that she's telling the truth.

209
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,471
But in my opinion, she may be a sociopath.

210
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,596
- Are you a psychologist?
- No. But I have had dealings with her before.

211
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,353
Dealings that might affect your judgment?

212
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,113
- No.
- We have to check it out. Question is, how?

213
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:09,159
I can spare an operative from
the cyber unit, and a security team.

214
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,196
- What do you think?
- Curtis should go.

215
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:14,477
- I need Curtis here.
- The computer file may be important.

216
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,677
Someone with experience
needs to examine it firsthand.

217
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:22,117
I agree. Send Curtis with a security team.

218
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:25,636
You'll have to figure out
how to do without him till he gets back.

219
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,517
Yes, sir.

220
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:37,039
- I don't like this.
- Neither do I, but those are our orders.

221
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,510
- Get it done and get back quick as you can.
- OK.

222
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,075
You OK?

223
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,793
Anything you need?

224
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,235
I'm fine.

225
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:00,392
You understand, Sarah, I had no choice.

226
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:06,237
You were identified as a threat
to security and I acted accordingly.

227
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,552
- I would've hoped you had more faith in me.
- Personally, I do.

228
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:14,952
But the evidence was brought to me by
the secretary of defense, I couldn't ignore it.

229
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:19,079
- So what happens now?
- You can go home and rest.

230
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:22,232
No one would blame you if you did.

231
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:27,235
But if you're up to it,
I could use you on the floor.

232
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:31,518
The San Gabriel Island reactor
went into meltdown less than an hour ago.

233
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:37,391
The five remaining plants are critical.
I need my best people in play.

234
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:42,034
I'll go back to work.

235
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,712
Thank you, Sarah.

236
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:54,272
It shouldn't be too complicated.
Security is light.

237
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,750
- I have a key card for Powell's office.
- How long will it take?

238
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,831
Five minutes to download the data.

239
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:04,357
- We're looking at a 15-minute operation?
- Approximately.

240
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:08,513
If I think you're stalling,
taking longer than you should,

241
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,273
I will take action. You got that?

242
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,590
Raise your leg.

243
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,353
Don't make me do it for you.

244
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:29,549
- Curtis, I'm not gonna run.
- Then you won't mind wearing it.

245
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,755
Can I put my foot down now?

246
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,068
Yes.

247
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:42,279
Look, I realise that after today
you have a hard time trusting me,

248
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,875
- but to pull this off you have to...
- I don't have to do anything.

249
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:50,829
Except retrieve the data your boyfriend hid,
and put you in jail for treason.

250
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:54,549
- Is that what you really want?
- Without a doubt.

251
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,868
Curtis...

252
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,951
Get your hand off me.

253
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,716
I spoke with Mike at the DOD office.

254
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,473
Who do you want to bring in
to help with their load?

255
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:18,916
Things are too unstable for me to leave here.

256
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,595
I checked with their logs
and they're gonna need someone soon.

257
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:27,754
- How are you holding up?
- I can handle it, if that's what you mean.

258
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,276
Dad, it'll be fine.

259
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,279
- Why don't you head over there then?
- OK. I'll call you from there.

260
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,313
- Sarah, you're back.
- Yeah.

261
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,996
- I heard some rumours about what...
- I'll be all right. Just bring me up to speed.

262
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,913
Sure. We're still trying to find the override.

263
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,198
- It's the only way to stop the meltdowns.
- What have you got out of Marianne?

264
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:03,352
She has access to a computer
with data about the override.

265
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,954
- Which computer?
- She's taking Curtis to it.

266
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,838
- They let her out?
- He's got a security team with him.

267
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:11,514
- And we trust her?
- She's trying to cut a deal.

268
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:15,309
Curtis can take care of her.
We need to support Jack.

269
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,277
- Agent Bauer? Agent Solarz.
- Agent Almeida.

270
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,033
- Set your perimeter?
- Nothing is going anywhere.

271
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,633
- Any activity?
- No.

272
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,790
OK. I want to keep this surgical.

273
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,838
We'll be the insertion team.
Your men maintain backup.

274
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,911
- You ready?
- Yeah.

275
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,352
Go.

276
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,239
We're clear!

277
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,995
- Dina must have lied.
- I don't think so. She wants to save her son.

278
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,196
Then they've cleared this place out.

279
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,317
Bring in a forensics team now.
I want fingerprints.

280
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,753
Yes, sir.

281
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,233
Tony?

282
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,311
What is it?

283
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,349
Go.

284
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,951
It's clear.

285
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,830
That's the train they attacked this morning.

286
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:51,756
So that's how the terrorists
got ahold of the override.

287
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,196
Jack?

288
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,389
They planned the kidnapping here.

289
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,471
Yeah.

290
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,874
The location Jack is searching
isn't on any agency watch list.

291
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,315
- Well, I'm having a hell of a time.
- Why?

292
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:46,918
The building's owned by a company owned
by another company that's owned by an LLC.

293
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:00,557
Wait, hold on. Galaxy Financial?
I've heard that name before.

294
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,679
No. I want that in a separate file.
We'll handle the kidnap another day.

295
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,433
I only want things pertinent to the override.

296
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,512
- <i> OK, I'll have it up on the system. </i>
- OK, thanks.

297
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,830
I need to talk to you...

298
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:15,639
I'm sorry. Just give me a minute.

299
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:19,028
- Yeah?
- <i> Jack, this is Sarah from CTU.</i>

300
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,714
I got something on that address
you gave to Edgar.

301
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:25,076
- What is it?
- Ownership of the building is complicated,

302
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,390
but I recognise one of the corporations.

303
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,516
- Which one?
- Galaxy Financial.

304
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,558
- <i>Never heard of it. </i>
- Neither did I until this afternoon.

305
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,949
When Paul Raines came in I ran his clearance.

306
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:38,715
- What does he have to do with the company?
- He's a general partner.

307
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:42,918
Audrey's husband owns the building
used to plan this morning's attacks?

308
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,878
- According to this, yes.
- Where's Audrey now?

309
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:50,033
- <i>She's on her way over to DOD.</i>
- Patch her through to me.

310
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:57,634
- Yeah?
- This is Sarah from CTU. I've got Jack.

311
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,359
- <i>Hold, please. </i>
- All right.

312
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,630
- <i> You're on. </i>
- Audrey, it's me.

313
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:10,111
- Hey. Did you find anything?
- The building was used to plan the attacks.

314
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,599
That's a great find.

315
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:14,194
- There's something else.
- What?

316
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,840
The company that owns the building...

317
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,876
Galaxy Financial.
Ever heard of them?

318
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:23,954
- No. Should I have?
- Your husband's the chief financial officer.

319
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,031
What?

320
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:31,558
- I need to find Paul now.
- Paul had nothing to do with the kidnapping.

321
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:34,313
Maybe not.
But his name's all over the paperwork,

322
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,915
and because of his relationship
to your father he has to explain.

323
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,436
I don't know where he is.
He left CTU without saying anything.

324
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,317
- Can you reach him?
- Yeah.

325
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,597
- I have his cellphone number.
- Call him, keep it personal.

326
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,238
Don't tell him what I know.

327
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,709
I just want you to tell me where he is.

328
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:56,677
Five power plants could still melt down.
If Paul has any information,

329
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:00,514
we have to follow through with it.
You know that.

330
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,830
- All right.
- Please get back to me as soon as you can.

331
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,035
OK, I will.

332
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,714
- Hello?
- Hey.

333
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,392
Paul, it's Audrey.

334
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:36,472
- Wasn't expecting to hear from you.
- <i>I know. I just... </i>

335
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:39,597
Look, I didn't like the way
we left things between us.

336
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:43,070
I didn't care for it much either. Look, uh...

337
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:46,357
I'm glad you called,
but I'm about to check out.

338
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:50,831
- Where are you going?
- What difference does it make?

339
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:56,756
Look, I was thinking about what you said,
how we've got so much going on for us.

340
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:00,799
- I thought you wanted a divorce.
- Yeah, I thought so too, but I just...

341
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:06,557
You know, Paul, today was the first time
that we've seen each other in months, and...

342
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,076
I don't know, maybe it took
a while for it to sink in.

343
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,071
Maybe you're right.

344
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:16,793
Maybe there is something there.

345
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,838
You know this is what I want,
more than anything.

346
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,717
<i>Then let me come over. </i>

347
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:26,351
I don't want to have the most important
conversation of my life over the phone.

348
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:29,716
<i>OK. I'm at the Westmore Hotel, room 408.</i>

349
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:34,671
- All right. I'll be there soon.
- Good. I'll wait for you.

350
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:43,912
No one goes down there till the forensic team
get here. When they do, I want fingerprints,

351
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,230
trace DNA, fibre samples, everything.

352
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,311
- I understand.
- OK.

353
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,189
Hey.

354
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,999
I need to follow up a lead on my own.
I need a favour.

355
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:00,039
I need you to take Dina and her son
back to CTU and head the interrogation.

356
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:03,271
They'd never let me set foot in CTU,
even if I wanted to.

357
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,079
Listen to me.
You're the only one I can trust.

358
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:09,232
Last two hours, I've watched
my friend come back to life.

359
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:12,357
- It's not that simple, Jack.
- I can get you reinstated.

360
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:16,558
But I need to know now,
is that what you want?

361
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,631
I don't know.

362
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,035
Maybe I was wrong.

363
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:33,519
You saved the daughter of the secretary of
defense, my boss. You do know that, right?

364
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,911
Jack.

365
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:43,150
Thanks.

366
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,629
I'll do it.

367
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,233
Lee.

368
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:51,996
Agent Almeida will be driving your car.

369
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,350
- Yeah?
- Jack, I spoke with Paul.

370
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:00,194
He's at the Westmore downtown, room 408.
I'm heading over there now.

371
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:04,717
Let us handle this. We don't know Paul's
connection yet. He could be dangerous.

372
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:09,032
He was on his way out the door. I had
to make something up to keep him there.

373
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:13,113
- Fine. I can get there instead.
- I'm only minutes away, and he knows that.

374
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,668
He's not gonna stick around if I don't show.

375
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:19,309
Audrey, I don't feel comfortable
with you going in alone.

376
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:23,029
Jack, he won't suspect.
He wants to talk about the marriage.

377
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:27,955
- <i>Look, I'll keep him there until you get there. </i>
- No. It's not an option.

378
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,838
- Jack, just get there as soon as you can.
- Audrey.

379
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,558
Audrey!

380
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,471
I just got off the phone with Jack.

381
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:56,348
He wants Almeida reinstated.
Do you have a problem with that?

382
00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:00,069
Considering what he's done today,
I have no problem with that.

383
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,515
- Good.
- Sir, you said you spoke with Jack?

384
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:06,229
- How long ago was that?
- 10, 15 minutes ago. Why?

385
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,357
We have some new information
I'd like to share with you.

386
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:13,911
- We found a connection to the terrorists.
- What kind of connection?

387
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,197
- Paul Raines.
- My daughter's husband?

388
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:20,795
One of his companies owns
the building Jack just searched.

389
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,555
- The building they planned the attack from?
- That's the one.

390
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:28,952
- Has anybody gone to pick him up?
- We have teams on the way to his hotel,

391
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:32,794
but he was about to leave.
We kept him there under a false pretence.

392
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,110
False pretence? What's that mean?

393
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:39,318
Jack told us that Audrey's meeting Paul
in his room. Jack's on his way over.

394
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:43,075
- What?
- She'll keep him there till backup takes over.

395
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,754
Unacceptable!
How could you let this happen?

396
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,196
This was her choice.
Jack did everything he could to stop her.

397
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:52,158
- When did you find out about this?
- Five minutes ago.

398
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,629
That's when you should have told me.

399
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:03,312
- <i> Want me to look into it?</i>
- Yeah. Find out.

400
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,870
- Tell me what you know about Paul Raines.
- Why?

401
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:11,238
- What's his connection to all this?
- How should I know?

402
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:16,033
Look, Curtis, I wish I knew
something that you could use.

403
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:19,430
Believe me, I'm quite clear
it's my only way out of this.

404
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:23,991
But I don't know any more
about Paul Raines than you do.

405
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:30,589
- How much longer?
- We're about five minutes out.

406
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,195
Raines' part in all this
is being investigated as we speak.

407
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:39,558
- If your name turns up linked to the kidnap...
- It won't.

408
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:43,792
I'll do everything I can to find something
on Powell's computer to help you.

409
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:48,158
Maybe something about
Paul Raines will be on there.

410
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:00,630
Yeah?
- <i> You're seeing Paul by yourself?</i>

411
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:04,235
- It's the only way to keep him here.
- If Paul was involved...

412
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:09,235
- Look, Paul would never hurt me.
- Strong evidence suggests he was involved,

413
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:11,515
which means he is dangerous.

414
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:15,115
- Look, I don't believe he is.
- You don't know what he is, Audrey.

415
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,589
I lived with him for eight years. I know him.

416
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:21,468
Yeah, I thought I knew him too.
Audrey, I forbid you to do this.

417
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:24,518
Dad, I'm sorry, I'm already here.

418
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:39,035
- Mr Almeida.
- That's right.

419
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:43,357
- Erin Driscoll, director of CTU.
- How are you?

420
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:48,514
This is Mrs Araz, and her son Behrooz.
Mrs Araz needs medical attention.

421
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,716
Take care of it, then interrogate them.

422
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:54,509
- We've told you everything.
- We'll see.

423
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,030
You're going to need these.

424
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:03,037
- I'm sure you're aware of my history here.
- Not an issue.

425
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:07,716
Jack Bauer and Secretary Heller
both vouch for you. That's enough for me.

426
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:13,033
All right. Thank you. Jack thought it'd be
a good idea if I headed up the interrogation.

427
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:17,636
That makes sense. You've had
the chance to observe them firsthand.

428
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:20,154
If there's anything you need, let me know.

429
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:33,399
That man I was just
talking to is Tony Almeida.

430
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:38,270
Keep an eye on him, let me know if he goes
off protocol. I'm particularly interested...

431
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:41,716
In communication between him
and Jack or Secretary Heller.

432
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,791
That's right.

433
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:49,476
- I'm seeing how things work around here.
- How do things work around here?

434
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:53,075
You can care less about
me being falsely accused and tortured.

435
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:57,676
You feel squeezed out, and you need allies.
That's why you were so nice to me.

436
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:03,278
We're facing a crisis today, Sarah. And our
first priority is to deal with it successfully.

437
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:06,989
- Is that a problem for you?
- Not at all.

438
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:11,312
But after what I went through today,
if you want help, I need something too.

439
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:14,710
- And what's that?
- I want my arrest expunged.

440
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:19,032
Not explained by an official
letter in my file, expunged.

441
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:22,430
And I want a promotion. Two pay grades.

442
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,471
Done.

443
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,191
Come on in.

444
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:52,393
I'm glad you came.

445
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,313
- Can I get you something?
- Sure.

446
00:33:56,560 --> 00:34:00,075
I had them send up
your favourite champagne.

447
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:04,869
Tell you the truth,
I wasn't sure you'd really come.

448
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,635
- Why wouldn't I?
- You were so adamant about ending things.

449
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:13,157
Your turnaround was just
a little surprising, that's all.

450
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:21,590
How about you? I hardly hear
from you for about six months,

451
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:25,753
then you see me with another man
and you're pouring Dom Perignon?

452
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:30,038
Shows what a fool I am
for not realising what I had.

453
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:33,874
It also shows that
I still have feelings for you.

454
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:40,750
And you must have some for me, too.
Otherwise you wouldn't be here, right?

455
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:47,952
I would hate to think that you were
playing some kind of game with me.

456
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:51,112
- I don't play games, Paul.
- Good.

457
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,473
To new beginnings.

458
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,551
New beginnings.

459
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:31,636
Miss Driscoll? It's Jack on line three.

460
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:33,876
Jack?

461
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:37,270
- Backup teams at the Westmore yet?
- No, they're in traffic.

462
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:42,036
I'm still a couple miles out. If your teams
get there first, tell them not to waste time.

463
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,917
I want them in that room.

464
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,037
Why not put some fibre optics in,
get a better position?

465
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:51,477
If Paul's involved, he'll be nervous.
I don't want anything to tip him off.

466
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:55,758
- I don't want Audrey in any more danger.
- OK. I'll pass that along to Tactical.

467
00:35:55,840 --> 00:36:00,436
- Has Curtis questioned Marianne about Paul?
- <i>She says she doesn't know anything. </i>

468
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:03,318
But they're about
to get into the computer files.

469
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,391
OK. Thanks, Erin.

470
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,917
It's right down this hall and to the left.

471
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:15,635
Stay alert.
This place may not be as empty as it seems.

472
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:18,951
- What? You think this is some kind of trap?
- Yes. I do.

473
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:25,036
Like you said, Curtis, this is my only chance
to stay alive. I'm not gonna blow it. So relax.

474
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,791
It's all clear.

475
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:14,712
This'll only take one minute.

476
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:27,316
Here it is. All I have to do is reformat and then
we can download the data and get out of here.

477
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:33,953
- Oh.
- What?

478
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:36,679
- The file has a second password.
- Do you know it?

479
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,955
I think so.

480
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,235
But it's strange.

481
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,990
Get your hand away from the gun.

482
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:54,633
Take it away.

483
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:58,355
The files are still secure.

484
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,830
I- I didn't give them anything. I...

485
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,155
Now put the gun down.

486
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,477
Put it down.

487
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:32,958
Your name is Curtis Manning.
You work for CTU.

488
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:36,589
Tell me how far along
you are in your investigation.

489
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:39,069
- What investigation?
- Of the override.

490
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:41,276
Have they discovered where it is yet?

491
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:46,912
You're an American, and you're working
with the terrorists? Who are you?

492
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,992
I'm gonna ask you one more time.

493
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:53,197
What does CTU know about the override?

494
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,993
Fine.

495
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:24,232
Or I could move to Washington.

496
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:31,071
I could turn West Coast operations
over to Ben Simon.

497
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,873
Audrey.

498
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:39,033
Yes, I heard you. Turn West Coast
operations over to Ben Simon.

499
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:41,714
- What do you think?
- I don't know.

500
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,439
You'd have to decide whether or not he was...

501
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:48,195
Not Ben Simon.
What do you think of me moving back east?

502
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:50,589
Oh, um...

503
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:53,558
Well, I, um... I don't know.

504
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:03,800
I feel like I'm doing all the work here. You said
you wanted to talk. You're not talking.

505
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:06,758
These things take time, Paul.

506
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:11,992
Well, maybe talking
isn't what we should be doing.

507
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:19,631
Why are you looking at me like that?

508
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:25,109
- You're my wife, for God's sake.
- You can't believe I came to sleep with you.

509
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:29,239
OK, you didn't come here to sleep with me
or to talk with me. Why did you come?

510
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:34,348
I just... I thought that maybe we could
spend a little time together. It'd be nice.

511
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,590
On a day like this?

512
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:40,150
All hell's breaking loose
and you thought it'd be nice?

513
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,913
I really wasn't thinking
when you called, was I?

514
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,912
What's really going on?
What? Are you spying on me?

515
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,549
- Are you doing something to spy on?
- What is that supposed to mean?

516
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:53,997
- I just... I think I should go.
- I think you should stay.

517
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:57,152
- Please just let me go, please, let me...
- No. No!

518
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:59,071
Take your hands off of her!

519
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:01,230
You set me up!

520
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:04,710
Audrey, get behind me.
Put your hands on your head now.

521
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,268
Now!

522
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:13,071
- What do you want?
- I want answers.

523
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:17,153
Well, I'm not talking to you.

524
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:40,071
