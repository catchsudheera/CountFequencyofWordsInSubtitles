1
00:00:12,821 --> 00:00:16,321
Sir, we just found this among
Meredith Reed's personal effects.

2
00:00:16,354 --> 00:00:18,354
It's a dedicated key card,
United Nations issue.

3
00:00:18,388 --> 00:00:20,821
To who? President Hassan and his family.

4
00:00:20,855 --> 00:00:22,688
It accesses their private residence.

5
00:00:22,721 --> 00:00:24,554
<i> We got her.</i>

6
00:00:24,588 --> 00:00:26,154
I want to know where you got it.

7
00:00:26,187 --> 00:00:28,721
Omar gave it to me.

8
00:00:28,755 --> 00:00:32,755
I gave Miss Reed this key card for
reasons I'm sure are clear to you.

9
00:00:32,788 --> 00:00:35,054
<i>Sir, are you confirming</i>

10
00:00:35,087 --> 00:00:37,054
a romantic involvement with Meredith Reed?

11
00:00:37,087 --> 00:00:39,688
I trust your complete
discretion in this matter.

12
00:00:39,721 --> 00:00:41,521
We have a problem.

13
00:00:41,554 --> 00:00:42,855
My brother confessed to the affair.

14
00:00:42,887 --> 00:00:44,788
I don't know if the frame's going to hold.

15
00:00:44,821 --> 00:00:47,121
<i> There is no reason to diverge</i>

16
00:00:47,154 --> 00:00:47,954
from the plan.

17
00:00:47,987 --> 00:00:49,020
How much longer?

18
00:00:49,054 --> 00:00:50,221
Your brother will be dead

19
00:00:50,254 --> 00:00:52,287
before the hour is out.

20
00:00:52,321 --> 00:00:54,821
What are you doing here?

21
00:00:54,855 --> 00:00:56,721
I thought I told you to leave me alone.

22
00:00:56,755 --> 00:00:59,087
<i>CTU.</i>

23
00:00:59,121 --> 00:01:01,121
Senior Data Analyst.

24
00:01:01,154 --> 00:01:03,354
Well, sounds like an important job.

25
00:01:03,388 --> 00:01:05,254
Damn it, what do you want from me?!

26
00:01:05,287 --> 00:01:06,588
A place to crash, for starters.

27
00:01:06,621 --> 00:01:07,755
You can stay the night.

28
00:01:07,788 --> 00:01:09,920
I want you out tomorrow.

29
00:01:09,954 --> 00:01:12,154
Ladies and gentlemen,
we're evacuating immediately,

30
00:01:12,187 --> 00:01:14,388
due to a possible bomb threat.

31
00:01:14,421 --> 00:01:16,621
<i>Madam President,
you and Secretary Kanin</i>

32
00:01:16,654 --> 00:01:17,755
need to move now.

33
00:01:17,788 --> 00:01:19,588
President Hassan, if you'll follow me.

34
00:01:23,987 --> 00:01:24,821
Yes?

35
00:01:24,855 --> 00:01:26,287
He's in the third car.

36
00:01:26,321 --> 00:01:28,388
The motorcade's coming up the ramps now.

37
00:01:29,621 --> 00:01:31,388
Officer, this is going down now.

38
00:01:31,421 --> 00:01:33,588
You can either stand here and do nothing

39
00:01:33,621 --> 00:01:35,054
or you can help me stop it.

40
00:01:35,087 --> 00:01:37,087
Cole, you need to stop Hassan's car now.

41
00:01:37,121 --> 00:01:38,721
The assassin is part of
the evacuation detail.

42
00:01:38,755 --> 00:01:40,388
There is no bomb in the UN.

43
00:01:40,421 --> 00:01:43,488
It's too late-- Hassan's
car just exited the tunnel.

44
00:01:43,521 --> 00:01:45,654
Cole, you need to stop that car,
or Hassan's a dead man.

45
00:01:55,721 --> 00:01:57,154
Cole!

46
00:01:57,187 --> 00:01:58,788
What was that?! What happened?

47
00:02:15,321 --> 00:02:16,755
This is a damn disaster, Brian.

48
00:02:16,788 --> 00:02:18,454
What do you mean,
you don't know what happened?

49
00:02:18,488 --> 00:02:19,954
How is Hassan? Is he all right?

50
00:02:19,987 --> 00:02:21,154
We don't know yet, Madam President.

51
00:02:21,187 --> 00:02:22,987
It appears the bomb threat at the UN

52
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:25,121
was a hoax designed to get
him out of the building.

53
00:02:25,154 --> 00:02:26,488
"It appears"?

54
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:28,887
An IED was planted on
Hassan's evacuation route.

55
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,887
And you drove him right into it!

56
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,954
One of our agents detected the ambush,

57
00:02:32,987 --> 00:02:35,154
tried to head him off
just as the bomb exploded.

58
00:02:35,187 --> 00:02:37,121
Well, you better pray he got there in time.

59
00:02:52,187 --> 00:02:54,421
Security there! Now!

60
00:02:59,454 --> 00:03:01,254
Stand down! I'm with CTU.

61
00:03:06,521 --> 00:03:09,254
Sir, we need to move you
to another vehicle. Now.

62
00:03:09,287 --> 00:03:11,521
Sir, you do not want to stay here.

63
00:03:22,254 --> 00:03:24,187
Go, go, go.

64
00:03:25,987 --> 00:03:28,621
Move! Move!

65
00:03:40,421 --> 00:03:41,388
Cole?

66
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:42,388
Yeah.

67
00:03:42,421 --> 00:03:43,821
Thank God you're okay.

68
00:03:43,855 --> 00:03:45,254
I got lucky.

69
00:03:45,287 --> 00:03:47,020
Hassan escaped the blast; he's fine.

70
00:03:47,054 --> 00:03:48,688
He's heading toward CTU,

71
00:03:48,721 --> 00:03:51,721
eastbound on 48th Street
in a black SUV. Got him.

72
00:03:51,755 --> 00:03:53,054
Mr. Hastings, here.

73
00:03:53,087 --> 00:03:54,887
Hassan, he's safe.

74
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,920
Dana, the assassin was posing
as a part of the security team.

75
00:03:57,954 --> 00:03:59,521
I know-- we got the info from Chloe.

76
00:03:59,554 --> 00:04:01,388
The police are putting up a thre
e-bock cordon now.

77
00:04:02,821 --> 00:04:04,788
Cole?

78
00:04:04,821 --> 00:04:07,654
Cole? Cole, are you there?

79
00:04:07,688 --> 00:04:09,887
I've got the suspect-
he's dressed as a cop.

80
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,221
Entering a white low-rise

81
00:04:11,254 --> 00:04:12,488
north of the UN.

82
00:04:12,521 --> 00:04:13,920
Call it in! I'm in pursuit!

83
00:04:13,954 --> 00:04:15,887
Chloe, I need to put out a priority APB.

84
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,154
Move, move, move!

85
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:48,920
What is it now?

86
00:04:48,954 --> 00:04:50,788
They've got a lead on the assassin.

87
00:04:50,821 --> 00:04:52,121
4722 East 47th Street.

88
00:04:52,154 --> 00:04:53,688
I'm gonna need my weapon.

89
00:04:53,721 --> 00:04:55,388
Your bag's right behind my seat.

90
00:04:58,821 --> 00:05:01,154
East 47th Street-- that's just above the UN.

91
00:05:01,187 --> 00:05:03,287
You're gonna need to turn now.

92
00:05:03,321 --> 00:05:04,187
Now! Now!

93
00:05:10,421 --> 00:05:11,488
UN Four, come in.

94
00:05:11,521 --> 00:05:14,521
UN Four, this is CTU Two. Come in, please.

95
00:05:14,554 --> 00:05:17,521
I'm sorry, I can't reach him. Try again.

96
00:05:17,554 --> 00:05:20,887
That's my husband in that car up there.
They're not answering.

97
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,855
I have to go to him. Dalia! Ma'am,
please, you need to remain in the car.

98
00:05:23,887 --> 00:05:25,621
Stay calm.

99
00:05:25,654 --> 00:05:27,221
I'll try another number.

100
00:05:30,954 --> 00:05:32,621
Where are you?

101
00:05:32,654 --> 00:05:34,054
Yes, we're safe.

102
00:05:34,087 --> 00:05:35,621
Dalia, Kayla and myself.

103
00:05:35,654 --> 00:05:38,621
I need to know about my brother.

104
00:05:38,654 --> 00:05:40,154
He's alive.

105
00:05:40,187 --> 00:05:42,920
He survived.

106
00:05:42,954 --> 00:05:45,087
Farhad, how is he?

107
00:05:45,121 --> 00:05:47,421
He's alive.

108
00:05:49,187 --> 00:05:50,321
God is with us.

109
00:05:52,788 --> 00:05:55,154
Can you tell me what happened?

110
00:05:58,254 --> 00:06:02,887
A car in the motorcade
swerved in front of him.

111
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,920
They're locking down the entire area.

112
00:06:04,954 --> 00:06:07,755
What would you suggest we do?

113
00:06:07,788 --> 00:06:10,354
It's over.

114
00:06:10,388 --> 00:06:12,054
Get out now.

115
00:06:12,087 --> 00:06:16,521
It can't be long before
they realize it's you.

116
00:06:19,954 --> 00:06:21,421
Farhad?

117
00:06:23,788 --> 00:06:25,987
Sir, please stay in the car!

118
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:28,020
Please, sir.

119
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:31,621
Sir, I need you to get back in the car.

120
00:06:39,454 --> 00:06:40,521
Oh!

121
00:07:18,488 --> 00:07:20,454
Get on your knees.

122
00:07:21,954 --> 00:07:24,887
Slide your weapon back to me.

123
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,954
Slowly...

124
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:27,521
slow...

125
00:07:29,054 --> 00:07:33,788
Now... you're going to walk me out of here.

126
00:07:33,821 --> 00:07:35,621
Call in.

127
00:07:35,654 --> 00:07:38,887
Say the southwest corner is clear.

128
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:43,621
Tell them to move the search
team to the northeast.

129
00:07:43,654 --> 00:07:45,588
Do it.

130
00:07:45,621 --> 00:07:47,855
You want to live?

131
00:07:47,887 --> 00:07:50,087
Make the call.

132
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,755
This is Cole Ortiz

133
00:07:58,788 --> 00:08:00,721
in the southwest corner of the building.

134
00:08:00,755 --> 00:08:03,654
I'm in pursuit of the assassin.

135
00:08:12,254 --> 00:08:14,054
He's with me now.

136
00:08:15,821 --> 00:08:17,954
You okay?

137
00:08:17,987 --> 00:08:18,954
You okay?

138
00:08:18,987 --> 00:08:20,887
Yeah, yeah, I'm okay.

139
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,721
Okay.

140
00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:34,688
Son of a bitch.

141
00:08:53,421 --> 00:08:55,721
Mr. President, Brian Hastings.

142
00:08:55,755 --> 00:08:57,454
We spoke on the phone.

143
00:08:57,488 --> 00:08:59,521
We're glad you're here. Please follow me.

144
00:09:03,788 --> 00:09:05,454
Is my family here?

145
00:09:05,488 --> 00:09:07,454
No, sir. We'll try and get

146
00:09:07,488 --> 00:09:09,254
you all together shortly.
Are they all right?

147
00:09:09,287 --> 00:09:11,020
Your wife and daughter are fine.

148
00:09:11,054 --> 00:09:12,421
And my brother?

149
00:09:14,321 --> 00:09:16,087
Was he hurt?

150
00:09:16,121 --> 00:09:18,087
No, sir.

151
00:09:18,121 --> 00:09:19,954
Mr. President...

152
00:09:21,221 --> 00:09:24,788
It appears your brother was
involved with the attack.

153
00:09:24,821 --> 00:09:26,554
My brother?

154
00:09:26,588 --> 00:09:27,920
Yes, sir.

155
00:09:27,954 --> 00:09:29,755
That can't be right.

156
00:09:29,788 --> 00:09:31,887
Bring him to me. I need to talk to him.

157
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,755
Unfortunately, we don't know
where he is at the moment.

158
00:09:34,788 --> 00:09:37,654
Then how can you be sure it was him?

159
00:09:37,688 --> 00:09:39,755
Mr. President, after the explosion,

160
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:43,321
he killed one of my men to
facilitate his own escape.

161
00:09:43,354 --> 00:09:47,054
There were witnesses,
including your wife and daughter.

162
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:49,221
He's the insider we've been looking for.

163
00:09:49,254 --> 00:09:52,154
There's no doubt.

164
00:09:52,187 --> 00:09:53,721
Excuse me, sir. I'm sorry for interrupting.

165
00:09:53,755 --> 00:09:55,321
You asked for any updates
about the assassin.

166
00:09:55,354 --> 00:09:56,755
And?

167
00:09:56,788 --> 00:09:59,421
He's dead. Jack just called it in.

168
00:09:59,454 --> 00:10:01,388
He uplinked some video
footage that you need to see.

169
00:10:01,421 --> 00:10:03,454
I'll be there in a minute.

170
00:10:03,488 --> 00:10:05,121
Don't let me keep you from your job.

171
00:10:05,154 --> 00:10:06,688
Thank you, sir.

172
00:10:06,721 --> 00:10:08,154
No, thank you. I owe you my life.

173
00:10:09,221 --> 00:10:10,821
Conference room.

174
00:10:10,855 --> 00:10:11,954
Uh, Mr. Hastings, uh...

175
00:10:11,987 --> 00:10:13,354
Meredith Reed,

176
00:10:13,388 --> 00:10:16,521
the woman you brought here for
questioning, where is she?

177
00:10:16,554 --> 00:10:17,887
Still here.

178
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,954
Looks like she'll be
cleared of any wrongdoing.

179
00:10:19,987 --> 00:10:21,721
I'd like to talk to her.

180
00:10:21,755 --> 00:10:23,287
I'll arrange it.

181
00:10:23,321 --> 00:10:24,354
Thank you.

182
00:10:24,388 --> 00:10:25,987
Excuse me.

183
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:28,654
I saw that. What?

184
00:10:28,688 --> 00:10:31,621
The way you looked at me when he
thanked me for saving his life.

185
00:10:31,654 --> 00:10:33,521
You think he should have been thanking you?

186
00:10:33,554 --> 00:10:36,020
I was actually thinking
he should thank Jack,

187
00:10:36,054 --> 00:10:38,454
then Cole, then maybe me.

188
00:10:45,488 --> 00:10:47,755
I underestimated you, Chloe.

189
00:10:47,788 --> 00:10:50,688
You saw what was really going on; I did not.

190
00:10:50,721 --> 00:10:52,755
It was a major save.

191
00:10:52,788 --> 00:10:54,421
And my report will state that.

192
00:11:04,521 --> 00:11:06,855
Chloe said you have some video to show me.

193
00:11:06,887 --> 00:11:07,821
Yes, sir. Take a look.

194
00:11:07,855 --> 00:11:09,321
These are images uplinked

195
00:11:09,354 --> 00:11:10,321
by Jack Bauer

196
00:11:10,354 --> 00:11:11,621
from the bomb site.

197
00:11:11,654 --> 00:11:13,421
It's the assassin who was targeting Hassan.

198
00:11:13,454 --> 00:11:15,354
We have an ID? Not yet.

199
00:11:15,388 --> 00:11:18,221
But I believe we do have a workable lead.

200
00:11:18,254 --> 00:11:20,354
These are tattoos off the
two men who attempted

201
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:22,121
to take out our informant this afternoon.

202
00:11:22,154 --> 00:11:23,688
Same as the assassin.

203
00:11:23,721 --> 00:11:25,121
We believe they indicate membership

204
00:11:25,154 --> 00:11:26,788
in a particular Russian crime syndicate.

205
00:11:26,821 --> 00:11:28,588
What's a Russian gang have against

206
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:30,087
the leader of the Islamic Republic?

207
00:11:30,121 --> 00:11:31,388
I don't know.

208
00:11:31,421 --> 00:11:33,254
Could just be hired muscle.

209
00:11:33,287 --> 00:11:35,221
But when the photos arrived,
I ran them by the FBI.

210
00:11:35,254 --> 00:11:37,421
Turns out, they had an agent
undercover working with

211
00:11:37,454 --> 00:11:39,388
the Russian mob here several years ago.

212
00:11:39,421 --> 00:11:41,087
A woman. Contact her.

213
00:11:41,121 --> 00:11:43,755
Already done. I have a
helicopter bringing her in now.

214
00:11:43,788 --> 00:11:45,987
Chloe, I think you worked with her.

215
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,654
Renee Walker.

216
00:11:47,688 --> 00:11:50,454
Says here she's no longer with the FBI.

217
00:11:50,488 --> 00:11:51,488
It's true.

218
00:11:51,521 --> 00:11:52,788
She resigned over an internal dispute.

219
00:11:52,821 --> 00:11:54,321
Meaning she was fired

220
00:11:54,354 --> 00:11:55,354
and her records have been sealed.

221
00:11:56,388 --> 00:11:58,321
What are we getting into here?

222
00:11:58,354 --> 00:12:00,321
Sir, we are only using her to brief us.

223
00:12:00,354 --> 00:12:01,788
These Russian groups are secretive

224
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:03,054
to the point of paranoia.

225
00:12:03,087 --> 00:12:04,087
She's the only one

226
00:12:04,121 --> 00:12:05,721
who ever got close.

227
00:12:14,154 --> 00:12:17,121
President Omar Hassan was
not harmed in the attack,

228
00:12:17,154 --> 00:12:19,821
and has since been taken
to a secure location.

229
00:12:19,855 --> 00:12:22,654
Confirmed fatalities now stand at three...

230
00:12:23,788 --> 00:12:25,755
...including a police officer.

231
00:12:29,187 --> 00:12:30,588
Yes?

232
00:12:30,621 --> 00:12:32,588
Why is my brother still alive?

233
00:12:32,621 --> 00:12:34,321
You're upset, Farhad.

234
00:12:34,354 --> 00:12:35,321
Justifiably.

235
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:36,588
Your man failed!

236
00:12:36,621 --> 00:12:38,554
Once you have the materials
in your possession,

237
00:12:38,588 --> 00:12:40,287
your brother, his peace conference,

238
00:12:40,321 --> 00:12:41,654
none of that matters.

239
00:12:41,688 --> 00:12:43,087
Isn't that what you told me?

240
00:12:43,121 --> 00:12:46,087
All you have to do is stay
calm and stick to your plan.

241
00:12:48,054 --> 00:12:50,621
Or should I be looking for another buyer?

242
00:12:50,654 --> 00:12:52,688
I'll be there soon.

243
00:12:52,721 --> 00:12:53,954
Good.

244
00:12:53,987 --> 00:12:55,688
We'll have a nice meal waiting.

245
00:12:55,721 --> 00:12:57,020
And we'll talk.

246
00:13:19,478 --> 00:13:21,911
I've been informed that the
bomb threat was a hoax.

247
00:13:21,945 --> 00:13:23,211
That's confirmed, Madam President.

248
00:13:23,244 --> 00:13:25,744
We've swept the negotiating
chamber with sniffer dogs

249
00:13:25,778 --> 00:13:27,444
and ground- penetrating radar.

250
00:13:27,478 --> 00:13:29,444
I can assure you, it's safe.

251
00:13:29,478 --> 00:13:32,211
I'm glad to hear it.

252
00:13:32,244 --> 00:13:33,744
Hassan is standing by at CTU.

253
00:13:33,778 --> 00:13:34,811
How is he, Rob?

254
00:13:34,845 --> 00:13:36,177
Well, he narrowly escaped

255
00:13:36,211 --> 00:13:38,778
being blown to pieces by his
own brother, so not too well.

256
00:13:41,311 --> 00:13:44,411
But your call to him can't just
be all sympathy and concern.

257
00:13:44,444 --> 00:13:47,077
We need to know where he stands vi
s-Ã -vis the talks.

258
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:48,411
It's hardly the time.

259
00:13:48,444 --> 00:13:49,578
No, it's exactly the time.

260
00:13:49,611 --> 00:13:51,144
The signing is scheduled for tomorrow.

261
00:13:51,177 --> 00:13:53,644
Dozens of world leaders are
already en route to New York.

262
00:13:53,678 --> 00:13:56,244
We need to know if we still
have a peace process.

263
00:13:59,277 --> 00:14:00,945
Put him on.

264
00:14:03,911 --> 00:14:05,044
Sir,

265
00:14:05,077 --> 00:14:07,578
I have President Taylor for you.

266
00:14:07,611 --> 00:14:08,911
Madam President.

267
00:14:08,945 --> 00:14:10,110
I cannot begin

268
00:14:10,144 --> 00:14:11,778
to say how relieved I am

269
00:14:11,811 --> 00:14:13,945
that you survived this
terrible attack, Omar.

270
00:14:13,977 --> 00:14:15,277
Thank you.

271
00:14:15,311 --> 00:14:18,478
I'm mortified that this
outrage happened on U.S. soil.

272
00:14:19,878 --> 00:14:22,744
I'm the one who should be embarrassed.

273
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:24,344
My brother, Farhad, did this.

274
00:14:24,377 --> 00:14:28,344
He betrayed me, and worse,
he put you in harm's way.

275
00:14:28,377 --> 00:14:31,411
I should have realized what he's up to.

276
00:14:31,444 --> 00:14:34,344
We can only be betrayed
by the people we trust.

277
00:14:34,377 --> 00:14:36,644
He fooled all of us.

278
00:14:36,678 --> 00:14:39,945
Sir, this is Rob Weiss.

279
00:14:39,977 --> 00:14:41,678
You've heard Farhad escaped.

280
00:14:41,711 --> 00:14:44,010
Can I ask what you think
his agenda might be,

281
00:14:44,044 --> 00:14:46,578
aside from targeting you?

282
00:14:46,611 --> 00:14:50,044
Uh, w-what I mean, sir,
is... does he have a plan?

283
00:14:50,077 --> 00:14:51,711
Yes, he has a plan.

284
00:14:51,744 --> 00:14:53,744
Regime change.

285
00:14:53,778 --> 00:14:55,478
Isn't that what you Americans call it?

286
00:14:55,511 --> 00:14:58,077
Mr. President, we're doing everything we can

287
00:14:58,110 --> 00:14:59,444
to apprehend Farhad,

288
00:14:59,478 --> 00:15:02,377
but while he's at large, I'd understand it

289
00:15:02,411 --> 00:15:05,010
if you wished not to continue the talks.

290
00:15:05,044 --> 00:15:09,678
However, I hope that I can
persuade you to reconvene.

291
00:15:09,711 --> 00:15:13,077
We have come so far together.

292
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:14,811
And to let this moment slip...

293
00:15:14,845 --> 00:15:17,411
Would be to hand Farhad victory.

294
00:15:17,444 --> 00:15:20,311
I will not give him this satisfaction.

295
00:15:20,344 --> 00:15:24,544
If you are willing to continue
with these talks, so am I.

296
00:15:24,578 --> 00:15:27,578
I am delighted to hear it.

297
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:31,344
Uh, if you could persuade

298
00:15:31,377 --> 00:15:33,578
Mr. Hastings here to release me.

299
00:15:33,611 --> 00:15:35,044
We'll coordinate with CTU

300
00:15:35,077 --> 00:15:37,644
so that you can return to
the UN as soon as possible.

301
00:15:37,678 --> 00:15:40,344
I-I know that you want to be
with your wife and daughter.

302
00:15:40,377 --> 00:15:41,344
Thank you.

303
00:15:41,377 --> 00:15:42,644
Thank you, Madam President.

304
00:15:49,911 --> 00:15:51,845
You want your office back, Mr. Hastings.

305
00:15:51,878 --> 00:15:53,077
It's fine, sir.

306
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:55,511
Can I ask what you and
President Taylor agreed?

307
00:15:55,544 --> 00:15:57,911
That I should return to
UN as soon as possible.

308
00:15:57,945 --> 00:15:58,911
We'll make the arrangements.

309
00:15:58,945 --> 00:16:00,077
Uh, before I leave,

310
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:01,077
I would like to thank

311
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:02,411
the young man who saved my life.

312
00:16:02,444 --> 00:16:04,478
That would be Agent Ortiz.

313
00:16:04,511 --> 00:16:06,010
He's returning to CTU right now.

314
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:20,678
You really should go to Medical.

315
00:16:20,711 --> 00:16:21,711
Yeah.

316
00:16:21,744 --> 00:16:23,144
Soon as I hand the body over to Forensics.

317
00:16:23,177 --> 00:16:24,544
What are you going to do?

318
00:16:24,578 --> 00:16:26,411
Finish my debrief, try and catch
that last flight to Los Angeles.

319
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:28,110
Thanks, Jack. It's been an honor.

320
00:16:28,144 --> 00:16:30,144
Take care of yourself, okay?

321
00:16:32,077 --> 00:16:33,244
Hey.

322
00:16:33,277 --> 00:16:34,311
I'm glad you're okay.

323
00:16:34,344 --> 00:16:35,678
Thanks. Me, too.

324
00:16:35,711 --> 00:16:37,945
We ID'd the assassin
using your video footage.

325
00:16:37,977 --> 00:16:39,277
We think he was working for

326
00:16:39,311 --> 00:16:41,044
one of the Russian crime syndicates here.

327
00:16:41,077 --> 00:16:42,177
Any idea which one?

328
00:16:42,211 --> 00:16:43,344
Not yet.

329
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:44,945
But we're bringing in someone to brief us.

330
00:16:44,977 --> 00:16:46,411
Good.

331
00:16:46,444 --> 00:16:49,110
Jack, it's Renee.

332
00:16:49,144 --> 00:16:51,478
What?

333
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:52,845
Why?

334
00:16:52,878 --> 00:16:55,177
Six years ago, she worked
undercover with the Russian mob.

335
00:16:55,211 --> 00:16:57,644
FBI says she's still one of
the best experts they have.

336
00:16:57,678 --> 00:16:59,911
Have you spoken to her?

337
00:16:59,945 --> 00:17:01,411
No.

338
00:17:01,444 --> 00:17:04,010
I tried phoning her a few times,
she never returned my calls.

339
00:17:04,044 --> 00:17:06,144
She made it clear she
didn't want to speak to me,

340
00:17:06,177 --> 00:17:07,678
so I-I let it go.

341
00:17:07,711 --> 00:17:09,611
I heard she had a rough time.

342
00:17:09,644 --> 00:17:11,077
Yeah.

343
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:13,811
Like, a really rough time-
some sort of a breakdown.

344
00:17:13,845 --> 00:17:15,344
She should be landing any minute.

345
00:17:15,377 --> 00:17:16,744
Look, she didn't want to talk to me then,

346
00:17:16,778 --> 00:17:18,177
she's not gonna want to talk to me now,

347
00:17:18,211 --> 00:17:19,411
and I want to respect that.

348
00:17:19,444 --> 00:17:20,778
So, please, don't tell her I'm here, okay?

349
00:17:20,811 --> 00:17:22,611
You sure?

350
00:17:22,644 --> 00:17:23,977
Yeah. Okay.

351
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:25,144
I'll be waiting for you

352
00:17:25,177 --> 00:17:26,144
up in Debrief One.

353
00:17:29,444 --> 00:17:31,811
We'll get you a full set of
photos as soon as possible.

354
00:17:31,845 --> 00:17:33,144
Thanks. Mm-hmm.

355
00:17:41,578 --> 00:17:42,544
Agent Ortiz.

356
00:17:42,578 --> 00:17:43,678
Mr. President.

357
00:17:43,711 --> 00:17:45,344
I want to thank you for saving my life.

358
00:17:45,377 --> 00:17:47,077
You're welcome, sir, but it wasn't just me.

359
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:48,277
If it weren't for Jack Bauer

360
00:17:48,311 --> 00:17:49,644
and Chloe O'Brian, I wouldn't have been

361
00:17:49,678 --> 00:17:50,911
in place to make the save.

362
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:51,977
Well, I'll thank them, too,

363
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:53,878
but you risked your life for me.

364
00:17:53,911 --> 00:17:56,277
You put yourself between me and the bomb.

365
00:17:56,311 --> 00:17:57,444
My family and I

366
00:17:57,478 --> 00:17:58,778
are in your debt.

367
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:01,110
What's that?

368
00:18:01,144 --> 00:18:03,144
It's a hazardous materials alert.

369
00:18:03,177 --> 00:18:04,644
Hazardous materials?

370
00:18:04,678 --> 00:18:05,977
Please wait here, sir.

371
00:18:09,411 --> 00:18:11,044
What's going on?

372
00:18:11,077 --> 00:18:12,845
The body triggered a hazmat alarm.

373
00:18:12,878 --> 00:18:14,511
We're reading radioactive contaminants.

374
00:18:14,544 --> 00:18:15,644
What sort of contaminants?

375
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:17,911
Rad count's low, so it could be uranium.

376
00:18:17,945 --> 00:18:19,678
It's just trace elements.

377
00:18:19,711 --> 00:18:21,711
There's no danger.

378
00:18:22,778 --> 00:18:24,211
U-235?

379
00:18:24,244 --> 00:18:25,311
It's highly enriched uranium.

380
00:18:25,344 --> 00:18:27,211
You mean it's weapons-grade?

381
00:18:27,244 --> 00:18:28,878
Yes. How the hell did he

382
00:18:28,911 --> 00:18:29,911
come into contact with that?

383
00:18:29,945 --> 00:18:31,377
I don't know, but he had to

384
00:18:31,411 --> 00:18:32,644
have been exposed to it recently.

385
00:18:32,678 --> 00:18:34,478
I think I know the answer.

386
00:18:34,511 --> 00:18:35,977
What is it, sir?

387
00:18:37,344 --> 00:18:38,578
Sir, we're talking about nuclear materials.

388
00:18:38,611 --> 00:18:40,544
If you know something, you need to tell us.

389
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:43,544
I need to talk to Mr. Hastings right now.

390
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,024
Hey, Renee.

391
00:19:28,057 --> 00:19:29,390
It's good to see you.

392
00:19:29,423 --> 00:19:30,624
This way.

393
00:19:49,991 --> 00:19:53,390
Didn't know you were back at CTU.

394
00:19:53,423 --> 00:19:54,924
Yeah. Morris lost his job a year ago.

395
00:19:56,124 --> 00:19:57,258
I asked to be reinstated,

396
00:19:57,291 --> 00:19:58,657
and this is where they assigned me.

397
00:20:12,057 --> 00:20:13,757
So what about you?

398
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:17,091
I heard you've been working
for a security firm.

399
00:20:17,124 --> 00:20:18,258
Uh, I was.

400
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:20,291
Didn't work out.

401
00:20:27,224 --> 00:20:29,191
So it's confirmed and you're certain.

402
00:20:31,091 --> 00:20:33,423
Thanks.

403
00:20:33,457 --> 00:20:34,991
It's Forensics.

404
00:20:35,024 --> 00:20:36,957
They confirmed the composition
of the radioactive material.

405
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:41,457
It's U-235, 94.7% pure,

406
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:42,757
weapons-grade uranium.

407
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:44,390
If you have an explanation, sir,

408
00:20:44,423 --> 00:20:45,857
I'm eager to hear it.

409
00:20:45,891 --> 00:20:49,358
Before we started this peace initiative,

410
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:52,057
my country was close to
developing a nuclear weapon.

411
00:20:52,091 --> 00:20:54,191
Yes, our intelligence was aware of that.

412
00:20:54,224 --> 00:20:56,157
You may also be aware
that we could not enrich

413
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:57,724
enough fissile material to arm it.

414
00:20:57,757 --> 00:20:59,291
Soon after our countries began

415
00:20:59,324 --> 00:21:02,624
to negotiate the peace process,
my brother came up to me

416
00:21:02,657 --> 00:21:04,557
and said that someone
had approached him with

417
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:06,557
weapons-grade uranium.

418
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:07,557
Who?

419
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:08,624
Someone who had access

420
00:21:08,657 --> 00:21:10,724
to decommissioned Soviet stockpiles.

421
00:21:10,757 --> 00:21:12,124
You think it's

422
00:21:12,157 --> 00:21:14,557
the same Russians who were
trying to kill you today?

423
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:16,590
Yes, I do.

424
00:21:16,624 --> 00:21:18,657
I told my brother to stay away from them,

425
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:21,390
but obviously he had other plans.

426
00:21:21,423 --> 00:21:22,757
Mr. President,

427
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:24,790
the nuclear material that you were offered,

428
00:21:24,824 --> 00:21:27,157
you have any idea where it is?

429
00:21:27,191 --> 00:21:28,891
That man was contaminated recently.

430
00:21:28,924 --> 00:21:30,490
Doesn't that mean the materials are here

431
00:21:30,523 --> 00:21:33,324
in the U.S.?

432
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:37,258
Farhad always used to tell me
that our country will always

433
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:39,024
be at the mercy of the West

434
00:21:39,057 --> 00:21:41,358
unless we become a nuclear power.

435
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:42,590
You must find

436
00:21:42,624 --> 00:21:44,091
the Russians

437
00:21:44,124 --> 00:21:45,124
before they can get

438
00:21:45,157 --> 00:21:46,824
the uranium to my brother.

439
00:21:46,857 --> 00:21:48,590
We'll do what we have to do, sir.

440
00:21:48,624 --> 00:21:52,258
I'll notify my security
forces to cooperate fully.

441
00:21:56,091 --> 00:21:57,457
Patty,

442
00:21:57,490 --> 00:22:00,457
get me the file on Renee
Walker's undercover operation.

443
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:02,390
The stars mean these men were
part of the criminal elite.

444
00:22:02,423 --> 00:22:03,624
<i>Vory v zakone.</i>

445
00:22:03,657 --> 00:22:04,991
This one spent time

446
00:22:05,024 --> 00:22:06,757
in a Siberian prison camp-- IK-10.

447
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:09,191
The number of spires
means length of sentence.

448
00:22:09,224 --> 00:22:10,224
Three years?

449
00:22:10,258 --> 00:22:11,291
Three life terms.

450
00:22:11,324 --> 00:22:12,557
Must have escaped.

451
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:15,891
Now these, broken cross,
here, here and here.

452
00:22:15,924 --> 00:22:17,557
Same on all three.

453
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:20,224
So what does it mean?

454
00:22:20,258 --> 00:22:21,690
Brian Hastings,

455
00:22:21,724 --> 00:22:22,790
director of CTU.

456
00:22:22,824 --> 00:22:24,624
I appreciate that you came in.

457
00:22:24,657 --> 00:22:26,091
So what does it mean?

458
00:22:26,124 --> 00:22:27,790
It means you can break our arms,

459
00:22:27,824 --> 00:22:30,191
you can break every bone in our body-
we'll never talk.

460
00:22:30,224 --> 00:22:31,291
It's supposed to be the symbol

461
00:22:31,324 --> 00:22:33,291
for a group called Red Square.

462
00:22:33,324 --> 00:22:35,124
Supposed to be? We tried to find them

463
00:22:35,157 --> 00:22:36,258
and never got close.

464
00:22:36,291 --> 00:22:37,724
A lot of rumors that they're ex-military,

465
00:22:37,757 --> 00:22:39,557
special forces, intelligence, whatever.

466
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:41,124
I'm not sure they actually exist.

467
00:22:41,157 --> 00:22:42,358
They exist, Ms. Walker.

468
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:44,124
And we need to find them.

469
00:22:44,157 --> 00:22:45,423
Why?

470
00:22:45,457 --> 00:22:47,690
You're aware of the attack in midtown today?

471
00:22:47,724 --> 00:22:49,390
You mean the smoking crater by the UN?

472
00:22:49,423 --> 00:22:50,690
Yeah, it was hard to miss.

473
00:22:50,724 --> 00:22:52,423
Well, we believe it's just the beginning,

474
00:22:52,457 --> 00:22:53,824
and that the group responsible

475
00:22:53,857 --> 00:22:55,891
is in possession of
unsecured nuclear materials.

476
00:22:57,091 --> 00:22:58,423
Now Dana asked you here today

477
00:22:58,457 --> 00:22:59,991
to brief on background.

478
00:23:00,024 --> 00:23:02,191
But I have a much bigger ask.

479
00:23:04,024 --> 00:23:07,091
You were undercover for nearly
two years with the Russian mob.

480
00:23:07,124 --> 00:23:09,358
Your cover's still intact.

481
00:23:12,124 --> 00:23:15,124
What are you saying exactly?

482
00:23:15,157 --> 00:23:17,258
Are you... are you asking me to go back in?

483
00:23:19,124 --> 00:23:21,191
Dana, Chloe, would you
give us a moment, please?

484
00:23:28,557 --> 00:23:30,457
I wouldn't be asking if
it weren't important,

485
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:32,091
but yes,

486
00:23:32,124 --> 00:23:33,891
I want you to go back in.

487
00:23:33,924 --> 00:23:36,224
And this doesn't seem in the least bit--

488
00:23:36,258 --> 00:23:38,091
I don't know, ironic to you?

489
00:23:38,124 --> 00:23:42,624
I know that you left the FBI
under difficult circumstances.

490
00:23:42,657 --> 00:23:45,724
Difficult doesn't even begin to describe it.

491
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:47,557
I can get you your badge back.

492
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:50,390
I laid down my badge, Mr. Hastings.

493
00:23:50,423 --> 00:23:52,624
I took it from my pocket and I laid it down.

494
00:23:52,657 --> 00:23:55,057
So why would you possibly
think that I want it back?

495
00:23:55,091 --> 00:23:57,924
Well, what do you want?

496
00:23:57,957 --> 00:24:00,523
What do I want?

497
00:24:00,557 --> 00:24:02,490
Nothing.

498
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:09,557
You have weapons-grade uranium
in the hands of the Russian O.C.

499
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:11,124
I can do something about that.

500
00:24:11,157 --> 00:24:13,258
So I'll go back in...

501
00:24:13,291 --> 00:24:16,091
but not for a badge.

502
00:24:18,991 --> 00:24:20,224
Thank you.

503
00:24:20,258 --> 00:24:22,924
We brief in ten minutes.

504
00:24:38,457 --> 00:24:40,624
Hey.

505
00:24:40,657 --> 00:24:42,358
Just want to say good-bye.

506
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:43,624
You're off finally?

507
00:24:43,657 --> 00:24:45,224
Yeah.

508
00:24:45,258 --> 00:24:46,924
How did Renee's debriefing go?

509
00:24:46,957 --> 00:24:50,024
It was going fine until Hastings
kicked me out. Why'd he kick you out?

510
00:24:50,057 --> 00:24:52,490
It just started to get really uncomfortable.

511
00:24:52,523 --> 00:24:54,824
Is that her undercover file?

512
00:24:54,857 --> 00:24:56,790
Yeah. I'm just trying to get up to speed.

513
00:24:56,824 --> 00:24:59,523
They found traces of
uranium on the assassin.

514
00:24:59,557 --> 00:25:01,657
Hastings says there's
nuclear materials in play.

515
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:02,857
Yeah, I heard.

516
00:25:02,891 --> 00:25:04,390
What's that got to do with Renee?

517
00:25:04,423 --> 00:25:06,957
He asked her to go back
under with the Russians.

518
00:25:12,991 --> 00:25:14,390
What is it?

519
00:25:23,224 --> 00:25:24,757
Hey.

520
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:26,857
Jack.

521
00:25:33,124 --> 00:25:34,824
Chloe didn't tell me you were here.

522
00:25:34,857 --> 00:25:37,690
I asked her not to.

523
00:25:37,724 --> 00:25:39,590
I didn't think you'd want to see me.

524
00:25:39,624 --> 00:25:40,857
Right.

525
00:25:40,891 --> 00:25:44,157
You tried to get in touch,
and I didn't call back.

526
00:25:44,191 --> 00:25:45,358
Sorry.

527
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:49,057
I was so happy to hear
that you were okay, though.

528
00:25:49,091 --> 00:25:50,324
Thank you.

529
00:25:50,358 --> 00:25:52,191
I'm surprised that you're back at CTU.

530
00:25:52,224 --> 00:25:54,358
I'm actually not.

531
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:56,057
I'm moving back to Los
Angeles with my daughter.

532
00:25:56,091 --> 00:25:58,157
I'm supposed to be on a
plane with her right now.

533
00:25:58,191 --> 00:26:00,523
Then what are you doing here?

534
00:26:00,557 --> 00:26:02,258
An old informant knocked on my door.

535
00:26:02,291 --> 00:26:03,724
Everything went downhill from there.

536
00:26:03,757 --> 00:26:04,857
The attack in midtown.

537
00:26:04,891 --> 00:26:06,191
That's why I'm here, too.

538
00:26:06,224 --> 00:26:08,091
I heard Hastings wants you to go undercover

539
00:26:08,124 --> 00:26:09,224
with the Russians again.

540
00:26:09,258 --> 00:26:11,757
He does. I've agreed.

541
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:14,423
You really think that's a good idea?

542
00:26:14,457 --> 00:26:15,857
They need me.

543
00:26:15,891 --> 00:26:18,857
I'm not worried about them.

544
00:26:18,891 --> 00:26:21,091
I'm worried about you.

545
00:26:21,124 --> 00:26:24,224
I know what you did.

546
00:26:24,258 --> 00:26:28,024
Really, Jack? What did I do?

547
00:26:28,057 --> 00:26:30,523
You almost killed Wilson
during your interrogation.

548
00:26:30,557 --> 00:26:33,790
In fact it was so bad,
the FBI had to let you go.

549
00:26:33,824 --> 00:26:36,423
Even after everything you did that day.

550
00:26:36,457 --> 00:26:41,057
Renee, I know where you are,
and it's a dark place.

551
00:26:41,091 --> 00:26:42,590
Yeah, and I've come back.

552
00:26:42,624 --> 00:26:43,957
It takes longer than you think.

553
00:26:43,991 --> 00:26:46,457
I wouldn't have signed up
for this if I wasn't ready.

554
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:47,891
And I don't think you are.

555
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:59,790
Renee, this is too important.

556
00:26:59,824 --> 00:27:02,091
You need to let them take
care of it. They will.

557
00:27:05,057 --> 00:27:08,091
I appreciate what you're
trying to do, really.

558
00:27:08,124 --> 00:27:09,423
You said you were going to Los Angeles

559
00:27:09,457 --> 00:27:10,757
to be with your daughter, right?

560
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:12,991
Please don't do this.
Go to California, Jack.

561
00:27:14,824 --> 00:27:16,657
I have a briefing.

562
00:27:30,813 --> 00:27:32,946
You will receive an official apology

563
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:34,613
for your detention here, but in the meantime

564
00:27:34,646 --> 00:27:36,980
I hope you can accept my
sincere personal regrets.

565
00:27:37,013 --> 00:27:38,879
I'm sure you understand
that given the threat

566
00:27:38,913 --> 00:27:40,145
to President Hassan,

567
00:27:40,179 --> 00:27:41,279
we were under extreme pressure.

568
00:27:41,312 --> 00:27:43,346
I would have thought that came with the job.

569
00:27:43,379 --> 00:27:44,646
Along with the ability

570
00:27:44,679 --> 00:27:46,279
to handle it.

571
00:27:47,579 --> 00:27:49,646
Good-bye, Mr. Hastings.

572
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:52,279
Ms. Reed.

573
00:27:57,212 --> 00:27:58,980
Thank God you're all right.

574
00:27:59,013 --> 00:28:01,512
I was lucky.

575
00:28:01,546 --> 00:28:05,646
I heard it was Farhad who
tried to have you killed.

576
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:09,179
I can't believe he would betray you.

577
00:28:09,212 --> 00:28:10,813
He betrayed both of us, Meredith.

578
00:28:10,846 --> 00:28:13,846
And then I betrayed you.

579
00:28:13,879 --> 00:28:16,446
What are you talking about?

580
00:28:16,479 --> 00:28:19,412
I told them about us.

581
00:28:19,446 --> 00:28:22,145
I was scared. I panicked.

582
00:28:22,179 --> 00:28:24,546
I hope you can forgive me.

583
00:28:24,579 --> 00:28:26,046
There's nothing to forgive.

584
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,080
But you stood by me.

585
00:28:28,112 --> 00:28:30,179
You didn't deny me.

586
00:28:30,212 --> 00:28:32,212
Even though you had a million reasons to.

587
00:28:32,245 --> 00:28:34,879
Before that moment, I...

588
00:28:34,913 --> 00:28:38,913
I never really knew what you felt for me.

589
00:28:38,946 --> 00:28:41,145
You should have.

590
00:28:41,179 --> 00:28:43,546
Didn't I make it clear?

591
00:28:48,579 --> 00:28:51,245
What? What is it?

592
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:54,412
I nearly died today.

593
00:28:55,946 --> 00:29:00,179
And I saw how fragile it all is.

594
00:29:00,212 --> 00:29:04,212
Not only my life, but
everything I've ever worked for.

595
00:29:04,245 --> 00:29:07,546
Any good I might be able to do.

596
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:10,679
I just can't jeopardize that.

597
00:29:12,779 --> 00:29:15,879
I understand.

598
00:29:15,913 --> 00:29:17,046
I'm sorry.

599
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,579
Don't be.

600
00:29:25,479 --> 00:29:27,245
Meredith...

601
00:29:58,946 --> 00:30:00,946
Six years ago I was
undercover with these men.

602
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:02,779
They were running an arms trafficking ring.

603
00:30:02,813 --> 00:30:05,245
We broke up the ring and arrested everyone

604
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:06,746
except for the man in charge-
Vladimir Laitanan.

605
00:30:06,779 --> 00:30:08,145
He's our target.

606
00:30:08,179 --> 00:30:10,346
It was through him I first heard
about the group Red Square.

607
00:30:10,379 --> 00:30:12,512
If anyone can connect us to them it's him.

608
00:30:12,546 --> 00:30:13,846
Everything I've read about Laitanan

609
00:30:13,879 --> 00:30:15,112
says he disappeared without a trace.

610
00:30:15,145 --> 00:30:16,613
How are you going to find him?

611
00:30:16,646 --> 00:30:17,980
Through this guy.

612
00:30:18,013 --> 00:30:19,279
Ziya Dakhilov.

613
00:30:19,312 --> 00:30:20,412
He's out on parole.

614
00:30:20,446 --> 00:30:21,913
He'll take us to Vladimir.

615
00:30:21,946 --> 00:30:25,013
The FBI offered Ziya full
immunity if he gave up Vladimir.

616
00:30:25,046 --> 00:30:26,312
He turned it down and kept

617
00:30:26,346 --> 00:30:27,779
his mouth shut and did his time.

618
00:30:27,813 --> 00:30:29,779
I'm not FBI, I'm a former felon, remember?

619
00:30:29,813 --> 00:30:31,980
I'll be offering Ziya
the deal of a lifetime.

620
00:30:32,013 --> 00:30:33,212
Trust me, he'll take it.

621
00:30:33,245 --> 00:30:35,179
Once I've made contact with Vladimir,

622
00:30:35,212 --> 00:30:36,679
I'll tell him that I've heard whispers

623
00:30:36,713 --> 00:30:38,145
of nuclear materials on the market.

624
00:30:38,179 --> 00:30:39,613
I'll say I have a buyer for them.

625
00:30:39,646 --> 00:30:40,813
Who's that going to be? Agent Ortiz?

626
00:30:40,846 --> 00:30:42,112
You up for this?

627
00:30:42,145 --> 00:30:43,212
Yes, sir.

628
00:30:43,245 --> 00:30:44,613
How much money are we talking about?

629
00:30:44,646 --> 00:30:46,779
For nuclear rods,
we need to show offshore accounts

630
00:30:46,813 --> 00:30:48,980
of $100 million at least.
Probably twice that.

631
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:50,679
Okay, I'll get on that.

632
00:30:50,713 --> 00:30:52,179
Chloe will work up a backstory to cover

633
00:30:52,212 --> 00:30:53,646
the time after your release from prison.

634
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:55,479
Now you and Agent Ortiz need to figure out

635
00:30:55,512 --> 00:30:56,613
where you met,

636
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:58,279
how long you've known each other.

637
00:30:58,312 --> 00:31:00,013
Jack.

638
00:31:00,046 --> 00:31:01,779
I thought you'd left.

639
00:31:01,813 --> 00:31:03,512
I'm sorry to interrupt.

640
00:31:03,546 --> 00:31:05,813
But could I have the room with Mr.
Hastings alone, please?

641
00:31:10,779 --> 00:31:12,846
You, too, Renee.

642
00:31:12,879 --> 00:31:14,746
I think I'll stay.

643
00:31:16,046 --> 00:31:17,980
So what's going on, Jack?

644
00:31:18,013 --> 00:31:20,412
Agent Walker hasn't been
undercover for over six years.

645
00:31:20,446 --> 00:31:22,346
I think you're making a
mistake by putting her in.

646
00:31:22,379 --> 00:31:25,813
Why don't you tell him what's
really on your mind, Jack?

647
00:31:25,846 --> 00:31:27,379
I'll tell him exactly what I told you.

648
00:31:27,412 --> 00:31:28,646
I'm concerned about her,

649
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:30,013
and this operation.

650
00:31:30,046 --> 00:31:32,145
So what does that mean?

651
00:31:32,179 --> 00:31:33,913
She's not ready for this.

652
00:31:33,946 --> 00:31:35,112
You must have other options.

653
00:31:35,145 --> 00:31:36,212
Mr. Hastings,

654
00:31:36,245 --> 00:31:37,713
no one else knows these Russians.

655
00:31:37,746 --> 00:31:39,980
No one else can get you as close.

656
00:31:40,013 --> 00:31:41,379
Unfortunately, I'm your only choice.

657
00:31:41,412 --> 00:31:44,512
I appreciate your concern, Jack,

658
00:31:44,546 --> 00:31:45,512
but she's right.

659
00:31:45,546 --> 00:31:47,179
She's our only way in.

660
00:31:49,312 --> 00:31:51,446
Fine, then I want to go with her.

661
00:31:51,479 --> 00:31:52,946
I assume your plan is trying

662
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,279
to set up a competing buy?

663
00:31:54,312 --> 00:31:55,646
I'll act as a buyer.

664
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:57,379
That won't be necessary.
Agent Ortiz has already agreed.

665
00:31:57,412 --> 00:31:59,579
He doesn't have the experience.
Then this is how he gets it.

666
00:31:59,613 --> 00:32:01,346
Not with nuclear weapons on the line.

667
00:32:01,379 --> 00:32:03,379
Mr. Hastings,

668
00:32:03,412 --> 00:32:04,779
I'm officially requesting

669
00:32:04,813 --> 00:32:05,946
that you send me in

670
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:07,546
with Agent Walker.

671
00:32:07,579 --> 00:32:10,046
Jack, if you're willing to do this,
I'd be foolish to object.

672
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:13,312
We'll work up a cover for you

673
00:32:13,346 --> 00:32:14,646
and dovetail it with Agent Walker's alias.

674
00:32:14,679 --> 00:32:16,046
We're going to have to work fast.

675
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,879
The Russians are going to want
to unload the nuclear fuel rods

676
00:32:17,913 --> 00:32:19,112
as quickly as possible.

677
00:32:25,613 --> 00:32:27,913
I'm sorry.

678
00:32:34,746 --> 00:32:37,046
Are you sure this information is reliable?

679
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,212
MAN : It checks out.

680
00:32:38,245 --> 00:32:40,212
All right then.

681
00:32:40,245 --> 00:32:41,312
Farhad is here.

682
00:32:41,346 --> 00:32:43,013
Bring him in.

683
00:32:45,946 --> 00:32:48,479
You look worried.

684
00:32:48,512 --> 00:32:50,679
Every cop in the country
is hunting this man,

685
00:32:50,713 --> 00:32:52,212
but we let him come here?

686
00:32:52,245 --> 00:32:56,312
So, how does looking like
a scared girl help us?

687
00:32:57,879 --> 00:32:59,579
This man is our buyer.

688
00:32:59,613 --> 00:33:01,512
Well, we found him,

689
00:33:01,546 --> 00:33:03,546
we can find another.

690
00:33:03,579 --> 00:33:06,879
Josef, my son, we are on the verge

691
00:33:06,913 --> 00:33:08,779
of the biggest deal of our lives.

692
00:33:08,813 --> 00:33:10,946
Farhad is paying us more
than anyone dreamed possible,

693
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:13,579
and you want to send him away
because he makes you nervous?

694
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,546
Sit down, please.

695
00:33:27,579 --> 00:33:29,312
A drink first, then some food.

696
00:33:29,346 --> 00:33:30,679
I want to see the rods.

697
00:33:30,713 --> 00:33:32,879
They will be on the same ship

698
00:33:32,913 --> 00:33:34,512
that will transport you
back to your country.

699
00:33:34,546 --> 00:33:37,179
As soon as we have completed

700
00:33:37,212 --> 00:33:38,512
our financial arrangements.

701
00:33:38,546 --> 00:33:42,346
You'll be paid, Bazhaev,
after I have the rods.

702
00:33:42,379 --> 00:33:43,779
They are in a secure place.

703
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:45,013
Show me.

704
00:33:45,046 --> 00:33:46,312
You've seen the photographs.

705
00:33:46,346 --> 00:33:48,080
That's not good enough.

706
00:33:48,112 --> 00:33:49,112
I want proof that

707
00:33:49,145 --> 00:33:51,046
the rods exist or you will not be paid.

708
00:33:53,746 --> 00:33:54,879
You want proof, huh?

709
00:33:54,913 --> 00:33:56,080
Okay.

710
00:33:56,112 --> 00:33:56,980
Come with me.

711
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,512
Josef...

712
00:34:29,312 --> 00:34:31,179
My younger son.

713
00:34:31,212 --> 00:34:33,546
He was transporting the rods...

714
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:37,179
...and he was careless.

715
00:34:39,112 --> 00:34:41,913
There. You have your proof.

716
00:34:46,145 --> 00:34:48,512
How long will it take to
get the rods to the ship?

717
00:34:48,546 --> 00:34:50,245
Five hours.

718
00:34:50,279 --> 00:34:52,713
I want to be there to supervise the loading.

719
00:34:52,746 --> 00:34:54,913
Whatever you want, my friend.

720
00:34:56,746 --> 00:34:59,746
Now where is my money?

721
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:03,980
I'll make the call.

722
00:35:21,526 --> 00:35:25,793
Agent Walker worked undercover
as Renee Zadan for 16 months

723
00:35:25,826 --> 00:35:27,493
before the bust went down
and she was incarcerated.

724
00:35:27,526 --> 00:35:30,125
We're focusing on the period
of time just after her release

725
00:35:30,159 --> 00:35:33,359
when she's supposed to be
in Mexico working with Jack.

726
00:35:33,392 --> 00:35:35,359
We're synchronizing two
years of travel materials

727
00:35:35,392 --> 00:35:37,125
mostly to and from Mexico City.

728
00:35:37,159 --> 00:35:39,092
What all do we know about
this Ziya character

729
00:35:39,125 --> 00:35:40,259
that she's visiting?

730
00:35:40,292 --> 00:35:41,659
Not much.

731
00:35:41,693 --> 00:35:45,259
He pled out to a clas
s-three felony one month after the bust.

732
00:35:45,292 --> 00:35:48,092
He's now in Long Island City
working in an auto parts store

733
00:35:48,125 --> 00:35:49,426
as a condition to his early release.

734
00:35:49,459 --> 00:35:51,659
That's where Jack and Renee are headed now.

735
00:35:51,693 --> 00:35:52,693
Where exactly are they?

736
00:35:52,726 --> 00:35:54,025
En route. Just leaving Manhattan.

737
00:35:54,059 --> 00:35:56,759
Good. Chloe, download the
cover materials to them.

738
00:35:56,793 --> 00:35:59,459
Walk them through it.
Make sure there's no surprises.

739
00:36:06,426 --> 00:36:08,226
Jack, it's Chloe.

740
00:36:08,259 --> 00:36:10,559
You should be receiving
a consolidated timeline

741
00:36:10,593 --> 00:36:12,860
plus detail files for travel and residency.

742
00:36:12,893 --> 00:36:14,559
Have they downloaded to your PDA yet?

743
00:36:14,593 --> 00:36:15,926
Yes, we got it, Chloe.

744
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,392
Oh, and Dana would like for me

745
00:36:17,426 --> 00:36:19,159
to review the facts with you,
if that's okay.

746
00:36:19,192 --> 00:36:20,893
We're fine, Chloe.
I know how to prep a cover.

747
00:36:20,926 --> 00:36:23,826
I'm sure you do, it's just that...
Chloe, it's all right.

748
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:25,426
As soon as we got something,
we'll get back to you.

749
00:36:25,459 --> 00:36:27,192
Okay, I guess

750
00:36:27,226 --> 00:36:28,926
I will leave you then. Good luck.

751
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,226
Thanks.

752
00:36:30,259 --> 00:36:31,826
You got a problem?

753
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:33,226
No, just that you've got

754
00:36:33,259 --> 00:36:34,860
everyone treating me like I'm an invalid.

755
00:36:34,893 --> 00:36:36,092
No one's treating you like an invalid.

756
00:36:36,125 --> 00:36:37,359
It's standard procedure.

757
00:36:37,392 --> 00:36:38,726
They're trying to sync up two cover stories.

758
00:36:38,759 --> 00:36:40,125
He's not gonna quiz me on the facts, Jack.

759
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:42,125
He gonna take one look at
me and decide if I'm lying.

760
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:44,992
I know. And whatever happens after that,
we need to be ready.

761
00:36:47,459 --> 00:36:50,125
It's hard being with you
when you don't think

762
00:36:50,159 --> 00:36:51,693
that I'm up to this.

763
00:36:51,726 --> 00:36:53,726
I never said you weren't up to this.

764
00:36:53,759 --> 00:36:56,059
I said I was concerned about you.
It's different.

765
00:36:56,092 --> 00:36:57,259
Whatever you call it,

766
00:36:57,292 --> 00:36:59,893
the fact is you don't trust me, not really.

767
00:37:01,759 --> 00:37:05,092
So here we are.

768
00:37:05,125 --> 00:37:07,426
Me and my babysitter.

769
00:37:16,893 --> 00:37:18,226
How are we on aerial?

770
00:37:18,259 --> 00:37:20,693
Already in place and
they're not even there yet.

771
00:37:20,726 --> 00:37:22,826
Jack and Renee are five minutes from target.

772
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:24,860
They should arrive just
before he closes up shop.

773
00:37:26,359 --> 00:37:27,926
Walsh.

774
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,992
Someday, you're going to have

775
00:37:30,025 --> 00:37:31,726
to tell me how you picked that name.

776
00:37:31,759 --> 00:37:33,192
I can't talk now.

777
00:37:33,226 --> 00:37:35,860
I like your apartment, Jenny. Real homey.

778
00:37:35,893 --> 00:37:37,893
And I gotta compliment you
on your housekeeping skills,

779
00:37:37,926 --> 00:37:40,125
everything is in its place.

780
00:37:40,159 --> 00:37:43,025
And I've been admiring your photos,

781
00:37:43,059 --> 00:37:45,359
I hope you don't mind.

782
00:37:45,392 --> 00:37:48,259
And I've noticed kind of a theme.

783
00:37:48,292 --> 00:37:49,826
You and your boyfriend, I'm guessing.

784
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:51,459
Is that right?

785
00:37:51,493 --> 00:37:52,559
Yes.

786
00:37:52,593 --> 00:37:54,292
I hope it's not too serious.

787
00:37:54,326 --> 00:37:56,793
We're getting married, Kevin.

788
00:37:56,826 --> 00:37:58,493
Wow.

789
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:00,059
Who would have guessed?

790
00:38:00,092 --> 00:38:01,826
When I saw you, you weren't exactly wearing

791
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:03,192
an engagement ring.

792
00:38:03,226 --> 00:38:04,693
So tell me about him.

793
00:38:04,726 --> 00:38:05,960
Kevin, don't.

794
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:07,526
Don't what?

795
00:38:07,559 --> 00:38:09,593
I'm curious, can you blame me?

796
00:38:09,626 --> 00:38:13,192
He's... he's just a guy that I met.

797
00:38:13,226 --> 00:38:14,759
A guy you met.

798
00:38:14,793 --> 00:38:16,826
What's that mean, a guy you met?

799
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:18,359
I just spent seven years
in prison with some guys.

800
00:38:18,392 --> 00:38:21,159
Is that the kind of guy you mean?

801
00:38:21,192 --> 00:38:22,826
You know what? I'm beginning to see that

802
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:24,493
we need to talk about this in person.

803
00:38:24,526 --> 00:38:27,025
Look, I told you that I'm in
the middle of a crisis here.

804
00:38:27,059 --> 00:38:28,192
I can't. I don't have time.

805
00:38:28,226 --> 00:38:30,059
You know what, Jenny? In my experience,

806
00:38:30,092 --> 00:38:31,392
when something's important,
you make time for it.

807
00:38:31,426 --> 00:38:32,559
Don't you think?

808
00:38:34,693 --> 00:38:36,125
Jenny, are you there?

809
00:38:36,159 --> 00:38:37,359
Don't call me that!

810
00:38:37,392 --> 00:38:38,359
What?

811
00:38:38,392 --> 00:38:39,493
I said...!

812
00:38:39,526 --> 00:38:41,426
You don't tell me what to call you,

813
00:38:41,459 --> 00:38:43,459
what not to call you, you understand that?!

814
00:38:43,493 --> 00:38:44,860
I'll call you whatever I want!

815
00:38:44,893 --> 00:38:46,526
You don't tell me anything, Jenny!

816
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:50,092
Now get back here.

817
00:38:51,125 --> 00:38:53,759
I said...

818
00:38:53,793 --> 00:38:56,392
that I will

819
00:38:56,426 --> 00:38:58,459
as soon as I can.

820
00:38:58,493 --> 00:39:01,226
Yeah, well, it better be soon.

821
00:39:38,326 --> 00:39:39,426
That's him.

822
00:39:41,426 --> 00:39:42,926
Looks like he's closing up.

823
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,125
Okay, we'll use these for comm so I can

824
00:39:45,159 --> 00:39:47,759
hear you in case you get into trouble. Okay.

825
00:39:52,926 --> 00:39:54,025
Hey.

826
00:39:56,226 --> 00:39:57,659
This is your last shot.

827
00:39:57,693 --> 00:39:58,960
You do not have to do this.

828
00:39:58,992 --> 00:40:01,092
I know, but I want to.

829
00:40:19,926 --> 00:40:21,526
: We're closed.

830
00:40:23,726 --> 00:40:26,226
What'd I say?

831
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,593
Renee.

832
00:40:31,226 --> 00:40:32,192
Ziya.

833
00:40:32,226 --> 00:40:33,926
Nice outfit. Not a lot

834
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,459
of men can pull off a skirt.

835
00:40:35,493 --> 00:40:36,992
When did you get out?

836
00:40:37,025 --> 00:40:39,793
I thought you were serving seven-to-ten.

837
00:40:39,826 --> 00:40:42,192
They let me out early. Good behavior.

838
00:40:42,226 --> 00:40:44,726
Good behavior.

839
00:40:44,759 --> 00:40:46,059
With warden?

840
00:40:46,092 --> 00:40:47,793
Well, eventually, yeah.

841
00:40:47,826 --> 00:40:50,860
But it's like anything else,
you gotta work your way up.

842
00:40:55,159 --> 00:40:57,392
So why you here?

843
00:40:57,426 --> 00:40:59,192
I'm looking for Vladimir.

844
00:40:59,226 --> 00:41:01,992
Got a business proposition I
know he'd be interested in.

845
00:41:02,025 --> 00:41:04,025
What kind of business proposition?

846
00:41:04,059 --> 00:41:07,493
Got a buyer, something big being sold.

847
00:41:07,526 --> 00:41:11,559
Yeah? I don't know. Vlad disappear.

848
00:41:11,593 --> 00:41:13,826
Hmm, maybe.

849
00:41:15,292 --> 00:41:17,326
But you can find him.

850
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:20,493
Really? Why I do that?

851
00:41:20,526 --> 00:41:23,159
Why do you think?

852
00:41:23,192 --> 00:41:24,992
I don't know.

853
00:41:25,025 --> 00:41:26,860
I'll cut you in.

854
00:41:26,893 --> 00:41:29,125
Unless, of course,
you're making so much money here

855
00:41:29,159 --> 00:41:31,092
that that's of no interest to you.

856
00:41:32,292 --> 00:41:34,426
See? Your greedy little eyes are saying,

857
00:41:34,459 --> 00:41:37,459
"Show me the money,
" so what's the problem, Ziya?

858
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:43,693
Parole bracelet?

859
00:41:43,726 --> 00:41:46,459
They know where I am 24-7.

860
00:41:46,493 --> 00:41:47,526
I'm like dog.

861
00:41:47,559 --> 00:41:48,860
I leave yard, I get shock.

862
00:41:48,893 --> 00:41:51,726
Well, then just help me out.

863
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:53,326
Make some calls.

864
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:54,860
Make calls?

865
00:41:54,893 --> 00:41:57,025
You know what happen I make
call asking where's Vladimir?

866
00:41:57,059 --> 00:42:00,059
Tomorrow, have accident on way for work.

867
00:42:01,559 --> 00:42:02,860
No, sensitive information,

868
00:42:02,893 --> 00:42:04,960
done face-to-face, you know that.

869
00:42:04,992 --> 00:42:06,192
You're lucky.

870
00:42:06,226 --> 00:42:10,559
You get out. Me, I'm still in prison.

871
00:42:10,593 --> 00:42:11,960
Let me see the bracelet.

872
00:42:11,992 --> 00:42:12,726
No.

873
00:42:12,759 --> 00:42:13,726
Come on. No.

874
00:42:13,759 --> 00:42:14,860
Let me see it, Ziya. Hmm?

875
00:42:14,893 --> 00:42:17,326
Ziya... What?

876
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:19,226
Have I ever messed you up ever?

877
00:42:19,259 --> 00:42:21,826
Come on.

878
00:42:23,593 --> 00:42:24,926
Let's see.

879
00:42:38,326 --> 00:42:41,793
I can get this off, guaranteed.

880
00:42:41,826 --> 00:42:44,392
You screw with this, you know what happen?

881
00:42:44,426 --> 00:42:45,826
Cops come running in.

882
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:47,893
In two hours, I'm back inside.

883
00:42:47,926 --> 00:42:49,860
Parole violation. Shh...

884
00:42:49,893 --> 00:42:51,693
What? That's not gonna happen,
I'm telling you.

885
00:42:51,726 --> 00:42:53,292
I know how to get this off.

886
00:42:53,326 --> 00:42:55,192
How do you know?
'Cause I'm constantly having

887
00:42:55,226 --> 00:42:57,392
to deal with people like you, that's how.

888
00:42:59,326 --> 00:43:02,125
I can get it off if I
can just hold it steady.

889
00:43:13,659 --> 00:43:15,526
But... you can't cut bracelet.

890
00:43:15,559 --> 00:43:17,025
I'm not gonna cut the bracelet.

891
00:43:50,493 --> 00:43:52,493
What have you done?

892
00:43:52,526 --> 00:43:54,459
What the hell have you done?!

893
00:43:54,493 --> 00:43:56,092
Like he said, he was trapped here.

894
00:43:56,125 --> 00:43:57,926
And think he's gonna help you now?!

895
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,426
That's it. This is over.

896
00:43:59,459 --> 00:44:00,860
This is over!

897
00:44:00,893 --> 00:44:02,826
Maybe for you, Jack,
but I'm just getting started.

898
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:04,326
Find something to cauterize that wound.

899
00:44:13,392 --> 00:44:14,826
Damn it.
