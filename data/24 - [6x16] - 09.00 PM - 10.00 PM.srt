3
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,257
- Yeah.
- Mark Hauser?

4
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:22,013
- Who's this?
- You know who it is.

5
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:26,457
- I already gave you what you asked for.
- But your employer has tightened security.

6
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:29,771
- So the access I paid for is no good.
- It'll take some time

7
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:33,489
- to download the new security protocols.
- I'll be there in 40 minutes.

8
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,857
Federal agent, get on the floor!

9
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:42,138
Hauser sold Gredenko security specs
for Edgemont nuclear power facility.

10
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:45,451
<i>- Does Gredenko have them?
- He's picking them up in 20 minutes.</i>

11
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:50,170
Hauser was wounded, but he's got a brother.
We're gonna use him for the transaction.

12
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:52,171
You look nervous, Brady.

13
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:56,619
All teams, take out your targets.

14
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:00,454
All teams, there's a third hostile
inside the vehicle.

15
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:02,934
You know who I am.

16
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:07,298
Then you know what I'm gonna do to you,
unless you tell me where the bombs are.

17
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,211
First, my terms.

18
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:13,816
Amnesty from your government
and a guarantee I won't be returned to Russia.

19
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,495
Nadia's being processed
as an enemy combatant.

20
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:19,413
I don't know if I can accept
that she betrayed us.

21
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,810
She spied for Fayed? I think we're wrong.

22
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:26,654
- I hear you and Nadia Yassir are friends.
- Yeah. Why do you ask?

23
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:30,494
I came across evidence at the switching
station that proves she's innocent.

24
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:32,855
You're cleared, Nadia.

25
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:37,455
<i>Admiral, is the Vickery ready to launch?</i>

26
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:40,771
- It's seconds from optimal launch position.
- Good.

27
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,691
Proceed with the strike.

28
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:47,331
Vice President Daniels is about to launch
a nuclear strike against the Middle East.

29
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:52,892
This strike is a complete reversal
of everything that he was working for.

30
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:56,734
You want Dr Welton
to bring him out of the coma?

31
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,014
Yes.

32
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:01,975
It's for you, sir.

33
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,449
<i>- Yes?
- I've called off the strike, Noah.</i>

34
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,770
I'm resuming my duties
as commander in chief.

35
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:12,537
Inform Admiral Smith and the others there's
to be no action without my authorisation.

36
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:16,455
It's apparent to me
the president is still suffering the effects

37
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:19,134
from the attack on his life.

38
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:21,814
I can't let him remain in power.

39
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,889
Get me the Attorney General.

40
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:36,376
<i>- (man) Should have live feed, sir.
- Secretary Dawes,</i>

41
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:39,020
- can you see and hear me clearly?
- Yes, I can.

42
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,455
Secretary Durant
and Attorney General Graves?

43
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:44,054
- Connections are being set up.
- And the president?

44
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,813
He should be arriving any moment.

45
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:54,539
- What are you doing?
- I need to get up from this wheelchair.

46
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:58,408
- No, you need to take care of yourself.
- Sandra, I can't afford to look weak.

47
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,173
Roosevelt did just fine
from a wheelchair.

48
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:04,730
Listen, when I face Daniels,
I want to be on my feet.

49
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,131
- Dr Welton?
- Yes, sir?

50
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:16,088
- Can you give me a shot of Adrenalin?
- Wayne.

51
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:21,418
I can. It'll raise your blood pressure,
which is not what you need right now.

52
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,297
<i>- The risk of...
- (knock at door)</i>

53
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:27,259
- Mr President? It is time.
- Give us a few minutes, please.

54
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,410
Excuse me, Mr President.

55
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,368
- Mr President...
- Just do it.

56
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:39,170
Now.

57
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,813
- What do you have, Jack?
- Gredenko offered us Fayed,

58
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:46,859
in exchange for immunity and a guarantee
that we won't extradite him back to Russia.

59
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:50,649
- Bill, I don't trust it. He rolled over too easy.
- What do you think his play is?

60
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:54,016
- I don't know yet.
- It's your call, Jack.

61
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,739
But you should know
what's happening in Washington.

62
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:00,051
- The president's regained consciousness.
- How is he?

63
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:04,816
Well enough. But Daniels is challenging him
under the 25th Amendment,

64
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:08,939
in large part so he can go ahead with
the nuclear strike against Fayed's country.

65
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:11,488
- Does he have a chance of winning?
- It's unclear.

66
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:16,700
But if Fayed detonates another bomb,
no one will be able to stand in Daniels' way.

67
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:22,537
If there's a challenge for the presidency,
the immunity agreement won't be binding.

68
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:26,659
Bill, you need to understand that I have
no intention of honouring this agreement.

69
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,935
Tell the Attorney General,
draw up the papers.

70
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,692
I'm calling him right now.

71
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:39,213
The president should be here momentarily.

72
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:58,488
<i>- (woman) Mr President.
- (man) Mr President.</i>

73
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:06,818
Mr President. I know
I speak for everyone here in saying

74
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:10,575
how very happy I am
to have you with us again.

75
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,371
Let's proceed.

76
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:25,368
<i>(Tom clears throat) As you know, an attempt
was made to assassinate the president.</i>

77
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:31,535
He sustained injuries so serious that the
doctors had to induce a temporary coma

78
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:36,296
in order to relieve the pressure on his brain.
In so doing, they saved his life.

79
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:40,692
The question now is whether,
in the words of the 25th Amendment,

80
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:46,252
he is unable to discharge
the duties and powers of his office.

81
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:49,571
- Isn't this really a medical question?
- Well, to a degree it is.

82
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:52,970
But the 25th Amendment
puts the final decision

83
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:57,019
- squarely in the hands of the cabinet.
- May we hear medical testimony?

84
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,809
Yes. Let me bring in the surgeon
in charge of the president's case.

85
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,573
Dr Welton, if you would, please.

86
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:12,808
The president has undergone an ordeal,
but from a medical point of view,

87
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:16,893
the greatest danger has passed. His
cognitive functions are presenting normally.

88
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:20,097
I have every expectation
that he will make a full recovery.

89
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:23,172
Might the pressures of the office
increase the chance of a relapse?

90
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:27,776
- It's difficult to say. It's certainly a possibility.
- Can you estimate those chances?

91
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:31,569
- No, I'm afraid I can't.
- If you had a vote, Doctor,

92
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:35,050
- how would you cast it?
- This is precisely the question

93
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:38,450
which the Constitution demands
that this cabinet answer.

94
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,496
Thank you very much, Doctor.

95
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,855
Mr President, I think now
would be an appropriate time

96
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:49,334
- to address the cabinet, if you would, please.
- The vice president initiated this process

97
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:53,015
because I stopped him launching
a nuclear strike against the Middle East.

98
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,489
But this vote shouldn't be about policy.

99
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:58,413
According to the Constitution,
you're judging me

100
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:02,812
to see if I am unable
to discharge the duties of my office.

101
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:06,415
Well, as you can see,
and as you were just told by my physician,

102
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:10,971
I'm in complete possession of my faculties,
and so to remove me from this office

103
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:15,053
would be to betray both your oath
and the American people,

104
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:18,177
who voted me as their president.

105
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:25,656
Mr Vice President?

106
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:31,536
Ladies and gentlemen of the cabinet,
the 25th Amendment is purposely vague

107
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:37,092
on how you're supposed to judge if the
president is unable to discharge his duties,

108
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:42,937
which is why this is very much about
the president's policies, and his actions.

109
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:46,012
Here are the facts:
when a second nuclear attack today

110
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,694
spread radiation over one of our major cities,

111
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:53,456
I decided it was necessary
to launch a retaliatory strike,

112
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:59,809
to show our enemies that if attacked,
we would make them share our pain.

113
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:03,779
Wayne Palmer's first act
upon regaining consciousness

114
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,816
was to stop that strike.

115
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:11,538
To respond to the attack by doing nothing.

116
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:16,617
In a time of war, the president must be
strong enough in body and mind

117
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,611
to defend this country.

118
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:23,728
And I'm afraid Wayne Palmer's actions
are the proof in this matter

119
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:29,099
that... indeed he is unable
to discharge his duties.

120
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:39,213
All right. Time is of the essence,
so unless there is an objection,

121
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:45,091
I would like to recess and then reconvene
for your vote in ten minutes.

122
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:12,899
- Any word on the cabinet vote?
- No, they haven't come back yet.

123
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:19,332
Look, Milo, about what happened today.
Let's just put it behind us, OK?

124
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:23,698
Which part? The... suspicion of terrorism,

125
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:26,658
or the... the other thing?

126
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:29,857
- The suspicion.
- And the other thing?

127
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:33,694
Let's not worry about it right now.
Let's try and get through the day.

128
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:35,691
OK.

129
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:42,577
I'm not gonna forget about the kiss,
and I don't think you are either.

130
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,571
<i>(phone rings)</i>

131
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:49,732
- Nadia.
- It's Doyle. Don't say my name. Just listen.

132
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:53,813
I need you to come up to my office.
Don't say anything to anybody. Just come.

133
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,299
On my way.

134
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:10,651
Have a seat.

135
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:19,092
Look, I know you and I
got off to kind of a bad start.

136
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:22,657
"A bad start"? You assaulted me.

137
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:28,055
This country is under attack. We had reason
to believe there was a mole in this building.

138
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:31,132
Starting with you wasn't racist.
It was common sense.

139
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:35,008
- So you're not a racist, you're just a sadist.
- You don't know me.

140
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,692
I think I do.

141
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:41,534
- Why did you call me here?
- Turns out there was no mole.

142
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:44,612
The terrorists could hack into
our system cos someone screwed up

143
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,168
and logged the wrong security parameters.

144
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:51,048
I'm pretty sure that someone was Milo,
and the proof is on his computer.

145
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:53,529
I need someone to get it
without him noticing.

146
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,611
I can't do that.

147
00:10:55,700 --> 00:11:01,138
Why? Is it cos you're too busy deciding
if you wanna sleep with him?

148
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:05,369
Listen, if you don't get the evidence for me,
I'm gonna call a forensics team

149
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:08,532
and they'll tear his system apart
as the entire floor watches.

150
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:10,850
And if they find
what I think they'll find,

151
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:14,489
everyone gets to watch Milo
hauled out of this building in handcuffs.

152
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:18,175
I'm sure it wasn't pleasant when it happened
to you, but you're gonna stand by

153
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:23,334
and watch it happen to him?
That's your idea of being a friend?

154
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:26,014
So you want me
to betray him for his own good?

155
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:30,537
I promise you, Milo will be better off
if you help me than if you don't.

156
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,292
Your call.

157
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,573
If the cabinet sides with you,
what will you do about Daniels?

158
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:42,255
The Constitution does not allow the president
to fire his vice president.

159
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:45,616
- But you can marginalise him.
- She's right. Get him out of the bunker.

160
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:48,168
I'd love to, but Daniels
has way too many supporters,

161
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:51,536
and I can't afford
to alienate any one of them right now.

162
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:56,819
Besides, I'd rather have him somewhere
where I can keep an eye on him.

163
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:59,937
- Mr President? The cabinet's reconvening.
- Thank you.

164
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:02,409
<i>(Karen) All right, let's go.</i>

165
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,819
Please, sit down.

166
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:26,860
Right. Ladies and gentlemen of the cabinet,
let us now begin the vote.

167
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:31,968
Will those of you who believe that President
Palmer is able to discharge his duties

168
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:35,018
please, at this time, raise your hand?

169
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,492
Do we have any abstentions?

170
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:51,049
The vote is seven to seven.

171
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:56,454
Mr Attorney General,
what would be the next step?

172
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:59,535
<i>Well, there's no need for a next step.</i>

173
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:04,330
<i>The Amendment requires that the vice
president and a majority of the cabinet agree.</i>

174
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:11,292
<i>There is no majority in the cabinet, it's split
evenly. President Palmer remains in office.</i>

175
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:19,690
It's not that simple.
One of the cabinet votes is invalid.

176
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:23,329
- Sir, which vote is not valid?
- National security advisor.

177
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:25,251
- What do you mean?
- She resigned.

178
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:27,695
- I resumed my duties.
- I don't agree.

179
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:30,489
I've seen no evidence
that you've been reinstated.

180
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:35,859
That is ridiculous. I sat here with you in
a cabinet meeting less than one hour ago!

181
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,454
Ms Hayes, allowing you
to sit in on the meeting

182
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:42,374
isn't equivalent to formally recognising you
as national security advisor!

183
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,974
In fact, I did not and do not
so recognise you.

184
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:48,848
- Oh, my God.
- And if Ms Hayes' vote is invalid,

185
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:53,411
then the tally's seven to six in favour
of invoking the 25th Amendment

186
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,697
and removing President Palmer from power.

187
00:13:58,780 --> 00:13:59,895
I'm sorry, Wayne.

188
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:07,338
Noah, don't waste your apologies on me,
because I won't let you steal the presidency.

189
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:09,854
- That's not gonna happen.
- Then what do you suggest?

190
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:12,613
- The country has to be governed.
- I would suggest, sir,

191
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:15,453
- that this is properly a matter for the courts.
- I concur.

192
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:20,011
<i>- We don't have time to go to...
- Mr Vice President, if I may.</i>

193
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:23,376
<i>I agree with Mr Lennox.
This is a legal question.</i>

194
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:26,770
<i>The Supreme Court was in session
this afternoon. We can recall it,</i>

195
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:30,899
<i>and have them render a decision
regarding the validity of the vote.</i>

196
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:33,016
<i>The matter could be resolved
in under an hour.</i>

197
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:38,538
Thank you, Attorney General Graves.
Get the process started and keep us advised.

198
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:41,498
I think this meeting is concluded.

199
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:53,098
- Get my affidavit started.
- Yeah.

200
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:55,171
Tom.

201
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:04,090
You know something?
I'm beginning to think you're not on my side.

202
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:06,774
Sir, I'm on the side
of the United States of America,

203
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:12,059
and if you ever thought otherwise,
you're very much mistaken.

204
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:28,213
Gredenko's attorney approved
the immunity agreements.

205
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:31,656
Yeah, we're just waiting for digital signatures.

206
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:38,612
All right. I'll inform the Attorney General's
office it's on its way. Thank you.

207
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,292
- Milo.
- What's up?

208
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:44,612
I'm having a problem. My station keeps
telling me to refresh the system credentials.

209
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:48,579
It's the hardware codes. You have to
reset them. I can take care of it.

210
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:50,173
Thanks.

211
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:54,209
- You OK?
- Yeah.

212
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:28,851
You were right. Milo forgot
to refresh the security parameters.

213
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:33,855
The breach was his fault. So when you tell
District, they can fire and maybe arrest him.

214
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:37,899
Which is why I'm going to alter the log
so they'll never know.

215
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:43,816
<i>(sighs) This should work, as long as
they haven't changed the password.</i>

216
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:49,611
There. It's done.

217
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:54,330
- Why did you do that?
- Cos all I care about is finding those nukes.

218
00:16:54,420 --> 00:17:01,132
We have a better chance of doing that with
Milo on board, whether he likes me or not.

219
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:04,656
"And mankind is naught but a single nation".

220
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:09,289
- You've read the Koran?
- And the Bible. And the Upanishads.

221
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:12,133
Anything I can get my hands on.

222
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:17,692
You're lucky, you've found your answers.
I'm looking for mine.

223
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:20,738
I'd better get ready to deploy.

224
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:51,339
- What did Doyle want?
- Nothing. Just reviewing some data sets.

225
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:56,812
There you go. Your system's back up.

226
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:59,451
Thanks.

227
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:19,218
<i>(phone rings)</i>

228
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,450
<i>- Buchanan.
- (Karen) Hi, it's me.</i>

229
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:25,249
- How did the cabinet vote go?
- It was a tie,

230
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:28,377
which in effect means
that Palmer is still in office.

231
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:32,169
- That's good. That's what we wanted.
- Daniels is contesting the vote.

232
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:35,172
- He's saying that mine is invalid.
- Based on what?

233
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:38,855
Based on the fact that I resigned,
and I was never officially reinstated.

234
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:44,139
That's ridiculous. You attended meetings.
You had no replacement assigned.

235
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:47,769
I know, but maybe he's right, Bill.
I did hand in my resignation.

236
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:51,933
Which was rescinded before it was
officially accepted. Daniels knows that.

237
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:55,251
- He's grasping at straws, Karen.
- I'm so scared, Bill.

238
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:58,616
If he wins, this will all be my fault.

239
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,975
Stop, stop.

240
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:05,450
It's desperate manoeuvring on his part,
Karen, nothing more.

241
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:09,499
He hasn't got a case.
And the Supreme Court will agree.

242
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:14,416
Well, we're giving our arguments
in 15 minutes.

243
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:18,732
- Call me as soon as the decision is in.
- Thank you for being there.

244
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:22,449
You don't have to thank me.
It's my job.

245
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,851
I miss you so much.

246
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,851
I miss you too.

247
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:32,329
<i>- I'll talk to you soon.
- Bye.</i>

248
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:37,531
<i>(sighs)</i>

249
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:42,129
<i>(speaking Russian)</i>

250
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,970
Good. My attorney
has verified the agreements.

251
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:55,129
- We're set. Gredenko's ready to make the call.
- We're standing by.

252
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:59,213
Doyle's got a team ready to go as soon
as Fayed tells Gredenko where to meet him.

253
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:03,134
You try and warn Fayed
with anything you say, or how you say it,

254
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:08,738
- and I will kill you right here, right now.
- I believe you, Agent Bauer.

255
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,811
Make the call.

256
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,692
<i>(phone rings)</i>

257
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:22,015
<i>- Yes?
- (Gredenko) It's me.</i>

258
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:26,739
- Do you have the security protocols?
- Yes. Where do you want to meet?

259
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:30,335
- Are you sure you're not under surveillance?
- Of course.

260
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:33,969
- Do you think I'd be calling you otherwise?
- I can't allow another mistake

261
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:36,449
to disrupt my plans
for the remaining two devices.

262
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:40,453
- Do you want the protocols or not?
- Where are you right now?

263
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:41,973
Culver City.

264
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:44,735
Meet me at the Santa Monica pier
in ten minutes.

265
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:49,089
<i>- Uh... It may take me more time.
- I won't wait.</i>

266
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:52,172
<i>- Where do I find you?
- Just be there.</i>

267
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:54,296
I'll find you.

268
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:01,813
Give him the phone. Bill, how long will it take
Doyle's team to make it to the pier?

269
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:04,698
<i>- He's about 30 minutes out.
- We'll make do with Ryan's team.</i>

270
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,771
Put him in the vehicle.

271
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:15,295
Instructions from the Supreme Court.

272
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:18,770
Our arguments have to be submitted
in writing in the next ten minutes.

273
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:22,853
Sandra's working on our brief.
How's it coming?

274
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:25,500
I'm just about finished.

275
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:30,176
We have a strong case. You resigned, and
Daniels was in charge when you returned.

276
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:33,650
So the legal question is,
did he consent to your reinstatement?

277
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:35,059
Of course he did.

278
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:39,019
And he made no objections
when you returned to the bunker,

279
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:41,250
and he never questioned
your right to be there?

280
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:43,649
No, he didn't.

281
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:46,334
His own actions prove our case.

282
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:49,935
Thank you. For everything, Sandra.

283
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:59,333
My affidavit explains everything - that
I never really intended to reinstate Karen,

284
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:01,490
letting her perform her duties temporarily,

285
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:06,529
therefore she had no authority
to cast a vote under the 25th Amendment.

286
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:10,977
Problem is, after she returned, you treated her
as if she still were national security advisor.

287
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:13,494
It's a question
of my state of mind, though, isn't it?

288
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:18,779
Yes. And your state of mind
will be inferred from your actions.

289
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:25,249
Doesn't sound like you think
our chances are very good.

290
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:26,819
I don't.

291
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:32,212
Then I am... deeply afraid for our country.

292
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:39,099
When the world sees that Wayne Palmer
isn't willing to fight back,

293
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:43,970
our enemies will be encouraged, these
recent attacks will be just the beginning.

294
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:48,611
America will be vulnerable
in a way it never has been.

295
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:53,535
There may be a way

296
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:58,455
to illuminate your state of mind
more explicitly.

297
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:10,452
I can swear an affidavit that earlier today
you told me to inform Karen Hayes

298
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:14,169
you had no intention of reinstating her,
but you'd let her perform her duties

299
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,330
on a temporary basis only.

300
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:21,972
Then Wayne regained consciousness before
I could have that conversation with her.

301
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:25,018
You'd be perjuring yourself
in front of the Supreme Court.

302
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:27,489
I'm aware that it's perjury.

303
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,773
But the end justifies the means.

304
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:36,656
My affidavit will push the court
to rule in your favour so that you can do

305
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:39,334
what's right for this country.

306
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:45,771
You're right.

307
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:50,970
Do it.

308
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:53,130
Prepare your affidavit.

309
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:01,451
And, Lisa...

310
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:05,211
Thank you.

311
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,174
Yes, sir.

312
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:28,211
Hasim, Hasan, with me.

313
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:33,493
I'm meeting Gredenko.
I'll be back within the hour.

314
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:35,571
And if you're not?

315
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:42,815
Are you worried for me, Halil?
Orjust anxious to take my place?

316
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:46,813
I think we're wasting time. We have
the bombs. We should use them right now.

317
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:50,813
Gredenko's information will enable us to
inflict damage across half of California.

318
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:54,336
There's other targets out there
will result in large amount of casualty

319
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:59,130
- without the additional risk.
- I've made my decision.

320
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,291
Let's go.

321
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:08,371
<i>(engine starts)</i>

322
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:19,211
<i>(Daniels) Come in.</i>

323
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:26,858
Mr Vice President,
I need to speak with you alone.

324
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:42,411
There is something in this room
you need to know about, sir.

325
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:46,971
"Something in this room"?
What are you talking about?

326
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:52,693
This small object here
is a microtransmitter.

327
00:25:54,620 --> 00:26:00,058
After you directed me to lie to the
ambassador about the assassination attempt,

328
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:02,608
I decided it was time to protect myself.

329
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:06,375
Now it turns out I was
protecting the country as well.

330
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:08,451
Be careful, Tom.

331
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:12,377
Be very careful what you try to do here.

332
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:17,255
Actually, sir, you are the one
who needs to be careful here.

333
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:22,733
<i>(Lisa) I'm aware that it's perjury.
But the end justifies the means.</i>

334
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:26,529
<i>My affidavit will push the court
to rule in your favour so that you can do</i>

335
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:30,579
<i>- what's right for this country.
- You're right.</i>

336
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:33,128
<i>Do it. Prepare your affidavit.</i>

337
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:35,211
Turn it off.

338
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:39,449
As I'm sure you're aware, sir,

339
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:43,089
conspiracy to commit perjury
is a felony offence.

340
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:48,334
Now, I strongly urge you to pick up
that phone and call the Supreme Court.

341
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:52,777
You tell them that you have withdrawn
your affidavit and that of Miss Miller as well.

342
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:55,249
Tell them you support
the vote of the Cabinet,

343
00:26:55,340 --> 00:27:00,175
that you have no further objections to
President Palmer continuing his presidency.

344
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:04,617
You do understand that I'm just
trying to do what's right for this country.

345
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,691
Well, so am I, sir.

346
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:16,170
Are you going to make that call now, sir?

347
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:34,094
Karen, I need the launch protocols
the joint chiefs set up with Daniels,

348
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:37,456
- and chain-of-command signing.
- They just came from the Pentagon.

349
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:42,819
Everything is in place. If the court sides with
you, you can cancel the strike permanently.

350
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:46,575
I also want an update on the situation
with Fayed. Has CTU made any progress?

351
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:49,094
Yes, they have Gredenko in custody.

352
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:51,978
Bill said they were gonna use him
to lure Fayed out in the open.

353
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:54,335
- Who's running it?
- Jack Bauer.

354
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:57,537
- Good.
- Wayne. The Supreme Court was just notified

355
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:59,895
Daniels withdrew his suit.

356
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:01,493
- What?!
- It's over.

357
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:05,778
He gave up before the court
had a chance to make its decision.

358
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:07,339
- Why?
- I don't know.

359
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:12,050
I just know that you're still
the President of the United States.

360
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:22,609
Let the Cabinet know I won't take any action
against those who sided with Daniels.

361
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,531
Yes, sir.

362
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:30,616
Oh, and Karen? Tell Bill I want him
to keep me up to date on CTU's progress.

363
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:44,179
<i>- (woman) Yes, sir?
- Melinda...</i>

364
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:46,820
<i>- Tell Dr Welton I need to see him, please.
- Certainly.</i>

365
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:52,093
I don't have a visual yet, but Fayed won't
show himself until he sees Gredenko.

366
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:56,014
- Ryan, what's your status with Gredenko?
- I've got the audio transmitter set up.

367
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,330
Preparing the tracker now.

368
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:00,456
Roll up your left sleeve.

369
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:04,499
<i>- (Jack) What's his range?
- We can track up to 15 miles.</i>

370
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:06,571
<i>Copy that.</i>

371
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:10,171
- Is it radioactive?
- Yes.

372
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:15,291
It penetrates into the bone.
It's got a half-life of about 11 hours,

373
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:17,689
so forget about digging it out
or making a run for it.

374
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:21,090
- He's good to go.
- Bill, how far out is Doyle's team?

375
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:23,410
<i>- About 20 minutes.
- We can't wait.</i>

376
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:28,210
Fayed was clear about his time line.
Ryan, send in Gredenko.

377
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,291
Gredenko's moving now.

378
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:43,893
I'm getting a clean audio signal
from the transmitter on Gredenko.

379
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:51,056
And we are locked on the isotope signature
that's being emitted from Gredenko's arm.

380
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,131
<i>(phone rings)</i>

381
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,053
Hello?

382
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:27,729
Hello?

383
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:34,373
I have the gain on Gredenko's transmitter up
all the way. There's no one on the other end.

384
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:38,857
He's reading something off his phone.
It's a text message.

385
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:44,856
Fayed's made contact. Everyone get ready.
Gredenko is heading south.

386
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:47,773
<i>(Gredenko, distorted) I'm moving in.</i>

387
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:52,888
- Milo, have you got him on the tracker?
- Yeah. He's still moving.

388
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:56,177
I'm heading in. I'm gonna follow him.

389
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:55,010
<i>(beeping/static)</i>

390
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:58,615
I've lost audio signal.
I'm going to secondary channel.

391
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:02,898
- There's no audio on the secondary channel.
- But he hasn't moved.

392
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:08,173
I don't like it. Something's wrong.

393
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:11,696
- You led them to me.
- I had no choice.

394
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:17,815
But if you listen to me,
we'll both get away from here alive.

395
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:20,611
Hasim.

396
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:37,972
Which direction, Milo?
I'm nearing the south end of the pier.

397
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:43,134
That's where he stopped
and entered the building on the left.

398
00:32:55,540 --> 00:33:00,978
- Is he still inside the room?
- Yes. He's right on the other side of the door.

399
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:03,051
I'm going in.

400
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:08,689
Milo, no one's in here.

401
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:15,049
Jack, the tracker's showing the signal
right there in the room with you.

402
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:25,217
My God!

403
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:29,896
They cut off Gredenko's arm!
Ryan, move your men in now!

404
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:36,534
Hold on. I've picked up his blood trail.

405
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:43,379
Fayed, their men will be coming
from the west side parking lot.

406
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:46,534
<i>We should go this way. (coughs)</i>

407
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:50,817
Ryan, circle back to the east side of the pier.
Try and cut 'em off.

408
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,538
I want Fayed alive.

409
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:09,411
- Ryan, you got anything?
- Negative.

410
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,411
- How far out is Doyle's team?
- 20 minutes.

411
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:14,651
Have him set up a perimeter
as soon as he gets here.

412
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:32,816
- Ryan, where are you? I'm pinned down.
- Moving towards you now.

413
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:39,890
Show me your head.

414
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:55,812
<i>(TV) The same terrorist cell is most likely
responsible for the explosion in Valencia...</i>

415
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:57,413

- This way.

416
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:00,731
<i>...and the assassination attempt
on President Palmer.</i>

417
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:03,209
- That's him!
- What?

418
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:08,135
I recognise him from the news!
It's the terrorist they're looking for!

419
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:11,610
<i>- (woman) Terrorist?

I am a federal agent. I'm taking this man
into custody. Now back off!

425
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:34,811
- Back off!
- He shot my friend.

426

We'll get him medical attention.
Just stay back.

427
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:40,777

- Shut up!

428
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:43,249
Everybody out of the bar now! Move!

429
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:48,453
Ryan, this is Jack. Gredenko is not here.
Lock down the area, initiate a search.

430
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:52,089
We have two men down. One is a civilian,
the other is Fayed. He's in custody.

431
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:55,968
- I need medical up here now.
- All right, Jack. Good work.

432
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:59,132
Nadia, get me the president, please.

433
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:09,051
I understand you're weak. More Adrenalin
will raise your blood pressure even higher,

434
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:11,210
to the point where we know
there'll be vascular damage.

435
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:14,531
- That's a risk I'm willing to take.
- Your wellbeing is my responsibility.

436
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:18,295
And my responsibility
is the wellbeing of this country,

437
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:24,012

or I will find someone else who will.

Thank you, Arthur.

441
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:50,612
Yes, sir.

442
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:02,256
- Bill?
- I'm calling to tell you

443
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:05,173
- that Jack has Fayed in custody.
- What about the bombs?

444
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:09,856
We haven't finished the scan yet. We can't
confirm the bombs are in the vicinity.

445
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:12,534
<i>Jack is going to interrogate Fayed
as soon as possible.</i>

446
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:15,692
There's no way of knowing
how successful that will be, right?

447
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:19,455
- No, sir.
- All right, Bill. That's what I wanted to know.

448
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:21,531
<i>Thank you, sir.</i>

449
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:19,016
The case was withdrawn. The court
has no reason to retain the documents.

450
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:24,970
They should be sealed and returned to me
immediately. Good. Thank you.

451
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:32,171
I was thinking that maybe
it's time to declare a truce.

452
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:36,095
OK. Well, maybe it is.

453
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:40,571
I know we both want the same thing
for this country, what's good for the country.

454
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:43,618
We just don't always agree on the means.

455
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:49,536
I would love to go forward
without the threats and the intimidation.

456
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:52,299
Done.

457
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:55,456
Good. One more thing.

458
00:38:55,540 --> 00:39:00,216
Do you know why the vice president
withdrew his suit from the Supreme Court?

459
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,416
No. I've no idea. Why?

460
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:06,459
One of my aides saw you with him
before it was announced.

461
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:10,579
I... I guess just put this down
to happy coincidence.

462
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:13,493
For now. But someday
I'd love to know the real story.

463
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:15,935
<i>- (phone rings)
- OK. Someday.</i>

464
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,011
Lennox.

465
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:26,450
He... This cannot be.
This has gotta be some mistake.

466
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:27,973
I'm on my way.

467
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:30,335
- President Palmer.
- What?

468
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:34,968
He's about to go ahead
with the nuclear strike.

469
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:38,934
Mr President?

470
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:45,533
If I may, sir. I understand
you're about to launch the very strike

471
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:48,373
we just prevented Vice President Daniels
from launching.

472
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:51,532
- That's right.
- This makes no sense, sir.

473
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:57,809
- It's what you risked your life to stop!
- I risked my life to reassert my authority.

474
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:01,415
Vice President Daniels calling me weak.
Even you thought the same thing.

475
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:05,334
I implore you, sir, do not mistake
being reckless with being strong.

476
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:08,139
- I am done talking.
- Mr President.

477
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:11,894
- We have a successful launch.
- Good.

478
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:04,091
